The brain structural MRI showed a deposition of ferromagnetic materials in the basal ganglia, with marked hypointensities in T2-weighted images of globus pallidus internus bilaterally. A resting-state fMRI study revealed increased functional connectivity in the patient, compared to control subjects, in the following networks: (1) between the primary motor cortex and several cortical regions, including the secondary somatosensory cortex and (2) between the globus pallidus and the thalamo-frontal network. These findings suggest that globus pallidus alterations, due to metal accumulation, can lead to a reduction in the normal globus pallidus inhibitory tone on the thalamo-(motor)-cortical pathway. This, in turn, can result in hyperconnectivity in the motor cortex circuitry, leading to myoclonus and tonic-clonic seizures. We suppose that, in this patient, Wilson disease generated a ‘lesion model’ of myoclonic epilepsy. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nWilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism, due to a mutation of the ATP7B gene, resulting in the pathological accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues [ ]. The most common neurological symptoms of WD are movement disorders, including tremor, dystonia, myoclonus, parkinsonism, and ataxia, as well as dysphagia, dysarthria, and drooling [ ]. The most common sites of brain abnormalities are putamen, caudate, globus pallidus and thalamus, where the accumulation of copper and other ferromagnetic materials results in hyperintense areas in T2-weighted sequences [ ]. MRI examination frequently shows hypointensities in T2-weighted and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) images, and this finding seems to be more strictly correlated with iron deposition, rather than copper concentration [ ]. Seizures are reported in 6.2–8.3% of WD patients and can be generalized and focal aware/impaired awareness seizures [ ]. Their occurrence may be due to metabolic encephalopathy, direct copper toxicity, pyridoxine deficiency during penicillamine therapy, and the progression of the disease itself [ ]. EEG features in WD patients are not specific and include changes in background activity, focal slowing, and focal/generalized discharges [ ]. White matter lesions on brain MRI are usually associated with epilepsy in WD with a possible bidirectional relationship, as there are reports demonstrating a role for seizures in contributing to the enlargement of white matter lesions, as well as neurological deterioration [ ]. Moreover, seizures could also be caused by Wilsonian cortical damage [ ]. \n\nAlthough myoclonic seizures have been previously described (in the form of progressive myoclonic epilepsy, generalized myoclonus, periodic myoclonus, and multifocal myoclonus), [ ] to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on clinical and electroencephalographic pictures of specific myoclonic epilepsies in WD patients. \n\nWe report the case of a patient with Wilson disease and a seizure disorder, characterized by an electroclinical picture resembling juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), one of the generalized genetic epilepsies of the adolescent. JME is characterized by juvenile onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic jerks without loss of consciousness, absences, and photosensitivity, with EEG showing normal background activity with generalized bursts of rapid spike-and-wave (4–6 Hz), and without focal abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [ ]. However, recent analyses of multimodal MRI found a crucial role in the disruption of the connection between basal ganglia and thalamocortical circuit in the genesis of tonic-clonic seizures [ ]. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the hypothesis that the accumulation of ferromagnetic materials in the basal ganglia has a role in the pathogenesis of the patient seizure phenotype. \n\n\n## 2. Case Presentation  \n  \nA 35-year-old right-handed woman came to our attention, after an incidental finding of hepatic cirrhosis with ascites at the time of cesarean section delivery in her first pregnancy. Based on the low ceruloplasmin levels (9 mg/dL; reference range 20–60 mg/dL), elevated 24 h urinary copper excretion (>100 µg; reference range <40 µg), increased hepatic copper concentration (1480 µg/g; reference range <50 µg/g dry weight), and detection of two heterozygous pathogenic variants in the ATP7B gene (p.Arg969Gln and p.Thr977Met), a diagnosis of Wilson disease was made. Her medical history was notable for a first tonic-clonic seizure at the age of 16, in the absence of any prodrome, following which she had developed a clinical picture characterized by photosensitivity, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and myoclonic jerks without loss of consciousness, predominantly occurring after awakening. Multiple EEG studies showed generalized bursts of rapid spike-and-wave of 4–6 Hz ( ), so a diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy was assessed, and the patient started lamotrigine at a dose of 300 mg/day, with good seizure control. The medication had been gradually withdrawn before her first pregnancy, with no seizure exacerbation. At the time of our evaluation, the neurological examination showed a slight distal postural and intentional tremor to the upper limbs and a minimal bilateral ataxia to the finger-to-nose test. Treatment with penicillamine up to 900 mg/day was started. After 5 years of treatment, the patient presented a reappearance of seizures and myoclonic jerks, so lamotrigine therapy was reintroduced. We performed a standard MRI, which documented a marked involvement of the basal ganglia, with hypointensities in the globus pallidus internus bilaterally, in T2-weighted sequences ( ). We wondered if the patient epilepsy phenotype and WD were a mere coincidence, or rather the seizure disorder of the patient was related to the metabolic alteration of WD and to basal ganglia alteration. To better understand the ictogenesis in our patient, we performed a multimodal MRI study using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and fMRI resting state analysis to investigate the structural and functional cortico-subcortical connectivity of the patient. A group of 30 healthy women (mean age 35.4 + 10 years), with no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases, were recruited as controls. At the time of the multimodal MRI study, the patient was in treatment with penicillamine 900 mg and lamotrigine 300 mg. \n\nVoxel based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state fMRI protocols are shown in the supplementary text section. All participants gave their written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the local Ethics Committee. \n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Voxel Based Morphometry Results \n  \nNo significant difference was found in the cortical/subcortical grey matter volume between the patient and controls. \n\n\n### 3.2. EEG-fMRI Results \n  \nNo significant epileptiform activity was recorded during scanning, neither any sign of drowsiness or sleep physiological activity. \n\n\n### 3.3. Functional Connectivity of the Primary Motor Cortex \n  \nWhen compared to the controls, the patient’s left M1 showed increased functional connectivity with the pre- and post-central gyri bilaterally, including the right secondary somatosensory cortex ( ;  ;  ). Increased connectivity was also found between the patient’s right M1 and ipsilateral supramarginal gyrus, pre- and post-central gyri ( ;  ;  ). The left M1 showed decreased connectivity with the left parahippocampal gyrus, cuneus, and lingual gyrus ( ;  ). \n\n\n### 3.4. Functional Connectivity of the Supplementary Motor Area \n  \nNo region of increased or reduced connectivity in the patient versus the controls was detected for SMA. \n\n\n### 3.5. Functional Connectivity of the Globus Pallidus \n  \nThe patient’s left and right globus pallidus (GP) showed increased functional connectivity with bilateral pre- and post-central gyri (medial portion), bilateral thalamus, the caudate nucleus (mostly the head portion;  ;  ;  ), compared to the controls. Decreased functional connectivity of GP with the body of the caudate nucleus and cerebellum was observed. The right GP was also less connected with the bilateral occipital lobe and right parahippocampal gyrus ( ;  ;  ). \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThe patient showed altered resting-state functional connectivity of the motor cortex, as well as of the basal ganglia circuit, and between the latter and the thalamocortical relay. Notably, an overall increase in basal ganglia-motor system connectivity was observed. These functional changes were not paralleled by the modifications of the cortical and subcortical volumes in the VBM analysis. We can suppose that the accumulation of ferromagnetic materials in the basal ganglia, especially in the globus pallidus internus, led to a disruption of the GP inhibitory tone on the thalamocortical circuit, contributing to the observed increase in MRI functional connectivity in the basal ganglia-motor cortex loop.  \n\nRecent computational analyses with multimodal MRI pointed out the presence of structural and functional alterations in patients with JME, particularly in the thalamus and thalamo-frontal network [ ]. Several VBM studies showed alterations in the frontal and thalamic gray matter volume [ ], and resting state fMRI studies demonstrated functional connectivity alterations in the prefrontal cortex and thalamo-frontal circuits [ , ]. Notably, Vollmar et al. (2012) demonstrated an increase in the connectivity between the prefrontal cognitive cortex and motor cortex in JME patients [ ]. Focusing on the thalamo–frontal circuit, O’Muircheartaigh et al. (2012) demonstrated altered connectivity between the thalamus and medial frontal regions, during resting-state fMRI [ ]. A growing body of evidence suggests that the structural and functional changes in epilepsy can also affect the basal ganglia [ ], which have a crucial role in modulating thalamocortical projections and cortical excitability. It has been recognized that a structural or functional alteration of the basal ganglia can be at the basis of generalized spike-wave discharges [ ] and can lead also to absence seizures, as well as to the evolution from focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures [ ]. Among the basal ganglia, a growing body of interest is placed in the globus pallidus internus, which showed a marked alteration in our patient. Indeed, Kim J. H. et al. (2018) pointed out how JME patients tend to exhibit significant volume reductions in the left pallidus and bilateral putamen and thalamus, when compared to the controls [ ]. Moreover, basal ganglia circuits have been demonstrated to have a role in the secondary generalization of focal seizures. He X. et al. (2020), through a series of “disconnection” simulations, demonstrated that an alteration of connectivity between the basal ganglia and the thalamo-frontal network is at the basis of focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures [ ], and that this alteration depends upon the direct basal ganglia pathway. Specifically, the disruption in the striatum-modulated tonic inhibition of the thalamus, by the globus pallidus internus, is responsible for the greater susceptibility to secondary seizure generalization [ ].  \n\nIndeed, this case-study has several limitations. First, beyond being a single case, direct evidence of a link between the increased functional connectivity and spike and wave generation in the patient was lacking. Unfortunately, at the time of the functional MRI experiment, no interictal epileptic discharges were evident. However, the observed increased functional connectivity can represent an enduring and predisposing condition, even in the absence of active epileptic discharges/epilepsy. This has indeed been demonstrated in JME patients [ , ]. Furthermore, the observed findings could be the expression of JME itself, and not a consequence of Wilson disease.  \n\nNevertheless, we assumed that the increased connectivity within the motor system, and between the globus pallidus and thalamo-frontal network, could be related to the possible role of the basal ganglia damage, due to metal accumulation in the pathogenesis of the patient seizure phenotype. In this view, our case may represent a lesion model of myoclonic epilepsy and of epilepsy with bilateral tonic-clonic seizures.  \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"9f7dc37551635e1031d63c360e1a9f52"},

Nevertheless, little research has been devoted to study the neural correlates of the ToL task using a network approach. Here we investigated the association between functional connectivity and network topology during resting-state fMRI and ToL task performance, that was performed outside the scanner. Sixty-two (62) healthy subjects (21–74 years) underwent eyes-closed rsfMRI and performed the task on a laptop. We studied global (whole-brain) and within subnetwork resting-state topology as well as functional connectivity between subnetworks, with a focus on the default-mode, fronto-parietal and dorsal and ventral attention networks. Efficiency and clustering coefficient were calculated to measure network integration and segregation, respectively, at both the global and subnetwork level. Our main finding was that higher global efficiency was associated with slower performance (  β   = 0.22,   P   = 0.04) and this association seemed mainly driven by inter-individual differences in default-mode network connectivity. The reported results were independent of age, sex, education-level and motion. Although this finding is contrary to earlier findings on general cognition, we tentatively hypothesize that the reported association may indicate that individuals with a more integrated brain during the resting-state are less able to further increase network efficiency when transitioning from a rest to task state, leading to slower responses. This study also adds to a growing body of literature supporting a central role for the default-mode network in individual differences in cognitive performance. \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00429-019-02004-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nExecutive functions are a set of mental processes that enable us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions and handle several tasks at once (Diamond  ). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that these functions are associated with functional connectivity (FC) of certain resting-state networks (RSN) (Rabinovici et al.  ; Funahashi and Andreau  ; Nowrangi et al.  ). Various RSN have been shown to be involved in executive functions, including the default mode network (DMN) which is active during rest and deactivates during task performance (Buckner et al.  ; Mak et al.  ; Anticevic et al.  ). Other relevant RSN for cognition are the frontoparietal network (FPN) (Cole et al.  ,  ) and the dorsal and ventral attention networks (DAN and VAN, respectively) (Fortenbaugh et al.  ). Although the utility of RSN in cognitive neuroscience and understanding of the neural correlates of cognition has been debated (Campbell and Schacter  ; Davis et al.  ; Iordan and Reuter-Lorenz  ), resting-state FC patterns show good correspondence with task-based FC patterns (Krienen et al.  ), are fundamentally stable (Gratton et al.  ) and may act as an intrinsic network architecture that shapes FC when evoked by a cognitive task (Cole et al.  ; Ito et al.  ). \n\nThe architecture or topology of the brain can be studied using graph analysis, where the brain is simplified to a graph of nodes (i.e., different brain regions) and edges (i.e., connections between brain regions) (Wang et al.  ; Bullmore and Sporns  ). Different properties of the brain network can be calculated using this graph. For example, efficiency and clustering describe the ability of a network to integrate and segregate information, respectively (Cohen and D'Esposito  ; Lord et al.  ). The brain balances its ability to integrate and easily transmit information throughout the network, and to segregate information processing in clusters of highly interconnected (specialized) neighboring nodes (Bullmore and Sporns  ). This ability of the brain for integration and segregation is vital for cognitive processes (Cohen and D'Esposito  ) and higher intelligence has been associated with a more efficient network topology (Langer et al.  ; van den Heuvel et al.  ). Conversely, dementia and cognitive impairments in the light of brain disorders generally show dysfunction in the brain’s ability to functionally integrate and segregate information (Dai et al.  ; Lopes et al.  ; Rocca et al.  ). Nevertheless, studies on the associations between network topology and inter-individual differences in cognitive functions in healthy subjects are relatively scarce, (e.g., Cohen and D'Esposito  ; Sheffield et al.  ), and to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet focused on the association between network topology and planning capacity. Planning is the ability to think ahead to achieve a goal via a series of intermediate steps (Owen  ) and is a vital function in daily life that we here operationalize in the form of the Tower of London (ToL) task. In this study, we investigated the association between RSN topology and planning performance, using a graph-based approach. Based on prior research (Langer et al.  ; van den Heuvel et al.  ; Sheffield et al.  ), we hypothesized a positive relationship between network topology measured during resting-state and cognitive planning ability, measured using the ToL task performed outside of the scanner. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects and measurements \n  \nData of healthy adult controls from two previous case–control studies (Gerrits et al.  ; de Wit et al.  ) were pooled for the current study. Exclusion criteria for all healthy subjects were the use of psychoactive medication, current or past psychiatric diagnosis, a history of a major physical or neurological illness, MRI contraindications or a history of alcohol abuse. Further exclusion criteria for the current study were: no available data on the ToL task, extreme behavioral scores (≥ 2 SD from the mean), a time-interval of more than 21 days between resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and performing the ToL task, or pathological incidental findings on the structural MRI scan. Written informed consent was provided by all participants according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the studies were approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the VU University Medical Centre (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). \n\nThe participants performed a computerized version of the ToL task as a measure of planning (Phillips et al.  ; Shallice  ). Details of the ToL task are provided in the study by (van den Heuvel et al.  ). In short, the participants saw two configurations (“begin” and “goal” position) of three colored beads on vertical posts of different heights. The purpose of the task is to determine the minimum number of moves (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) needed to match the configuration of the goal position. Participants responded via the matching keyboard-button. The first post can hold all three beads, the second two, and the third post one. Only one bead can be moved at a time and only if there is no other bead on top of it. Prior to the experiment, participants were provided verbal and written explanation and performed a practice run. Performance on the ToL task was indicated by the mean accuracy and mean reaction time on correct trials across all five difficulty levels (Kaller et al.  ). Intelligence scores were approximated by the Dutch Adult Reading test (NLV; (Schmand et al.  ). We scored education level according to the Dutch Verhage scale (Verhage  ) that ranges from 1—primary school not finished, to 7—university or higher. Handedness was assessed using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield  ). \n\n\n### MR image acquisition \n  \nMR images were acquired at Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) on a GE Signa HDxt 3 T MRI scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an eight-channel head coil. The participant’s head was immobilized using foam pads to reduce motion artifacts. Participants were told to lie still, keep their eyes closed and not fall asleep during the acquisition of the rs-fMRI scan (duration: 5.9 min). T2*-weighted echo-planar (EPI) images were acquired with TR = 1.8 s, TE = 35 ms, 64 × 64 matrix, field of view = 24 cm and flip angle = 80° and 40 ascending slices per volume (3.75 × 3.75 mm in plane resolution; slice thickness = 2.8 mm; interslice gap = 0.2 mm). Structural scanning encompassed a sagittal three-dimensional gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence (256 × 256 matrix; voxel size = 1 × 0.977 × 0.977 mm; 172 slices). \n\n\n### Image (pre)processing \n  \nRS-fMRI and T1-weighted images were preprocessed with FMRIB’s Software Library version 5.0.10 (FSL; (Smith et al.  )). The first four volumes were discarded to reach steady-state magnetization. Non-brain tissue was removed using BET and the structural image was segmented into gray (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using FAST. Functional images were re-aligned using McFLIRT and the resulting six rigid-body parameters were used to calculate the motion parameters. Functional images were spatially smoothed with a 5 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) kernel. Subjects with significant motion during scanning, defined as a mean relative root mean squared displacement (RMS) > 0.2 mm, or > 20 volumes with frame-wise relative RMS displacement > 0.25 mm, were excluded (Ciric et al.  ). Because rs-fMRI is exceptionally sensitive to motion artefacts (Power et al.  ), we additionally performed ICA-AROMA (Pruim et al.  ). ICA-AROMA is a single-subject denoising strategy based on independent component analysis (ICA) that automatically identifies motion-related components in the functional data based on their high-frequency content, correlation with the motion parameters and edge and CSF fraction and removes their variance from the data (Pruim et al.  ). ICA-AROMA has been shown to provide a good trade-off between reducing noise and preserving BOLD signal (Ciric et al.  ; Pruim et al.  ; Parkes et al.  ). After ICA-AROMA, additional nuisance regression was performed by removing signal from the WM and CSF and functional images were high-pass filtered (100 s cut-off). \n\nThe functional scan was registered to the anatomical T1-scans using boundary-based registration (FSL epi_reg). The anatomical image was parcellated into 225 nodes; 210 cortical nodes were defined based on the Brainnetome Atlas (Fan et al.  ), 14 subcortical nodes were individually segmented using FSL FIRST (Patenaude et al.  ) and one cerebellar node was defined based on the FSL’s cerebellar atlas (Diedrichsen et al.  ). EPI distortions during fMRI can lead to signal drop-out. To account for signal dropout near air/tissue boundaries during scanning, we applied a mask to the functional scan to exclude voxels with signal intensities in the lowest quartile of the robust range (Meijer et al.  ). Nodes were discarded if they comprised less than four signal-containing voxels. This rendered a total of 194 common brain regions across all subjects. Time-series were extracted from each node. The cortical nodes were subdivided into four RSN: the DMN, FPN, DAN and VAN based on the functional subdivision by Yeo et al. ( ); see supplementary Table 1. \n\n\n### Functional connectivity matrices \n  \nTo measure FC and construct connectivity matrices we applied wavelet coherence on the time-series of each possible pair of the 194 brain regions within the frequency range 0.06 and 0.12 Hz (Chang and Glover  ). Wavelet coherence has several advantages over Pearson’s correlations, including denoising properties and robustness to outliers (Gu et al.  ; Fadili and Bullmore  ; Achard et al.  ). The 0.06–0.12 Hz frequency range was chosen because it has been suggested to be a reliable and robust range that is associated with cognitive performance (Zhang et al.  ; Bassett et al.  ). We applied wavelet coherence to the entire rs-fMRI scan to calculate the network measures (see below). An overview of the (pre)processing pipeline is provided in Fig.  .   \nOutline of the processing pipeline. (A) Resting-state fMRI data were collected and (B) pre-processed. The brain was (C) parcellated into separate brain regions (nodes). There were 194 nodes common to all subjects with enough signal to (D) construct connectivity matrices (see text) using wavelet coherence. (E) network measures were calculated from each connectivity matrix on the global and subnetwork level. (F) multiple regression analyses were applied to relate performance on the Tower of London (ToL) task to network measures \n  \n\n\n### Network measures \n  \nAt the global level, we calculated global efficiency and global clustering coefficient (Gcc). Global efficiency is the inverse of the average path length (i.e., the maximum connectivity between each pair of nodes), with high efficiency meaning that information can rapidly travel through the whole network (Latora and Marchiori  ). Gcc is equivalent to the proportion of the actual number of edges between the nearest neighbors of a node to all possible edges and signifies the tendency of the whole network to segregate into locally interconnected triplets that function as a specialized subunit (Rubinov and Sporns  ). Test–retest reliability of global efficiency and Gcc are fair-to-good (Welton et al.  ). At the subnetwork level, we calculated efficiency and clustering coefficient for each of the four RSNs (DMN, FPN, DAN and VAN). In addition, we determined the mean FC between each of the four RSNs (resulting in six between-network mean FC values). Test–retest reliability of these measures at the subnetwork level is unknown. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). We describe demographical characteristics and performance on the ToL task using means and standard deviations unless indicated otherwise. Pearson’s (  r  ) or Spearman’s rho (  r  ) correlations were performed between demographic and performance measures, depending on the distribution. We performed bootstrapped hierarchal multiple regression analysis to investigate the association between network measures (predictors) and accuracy and reaction time on the ToL task (outcome measures). Because age was correlated with performance, age was entered in the first block of all models. The network measure of interest and mean RMS displacement, as a measure for motion, were entered in the second and third block, respectively. As a sensitivity analysis, we entered sex or education level to the fourth block of the model. The regression models were bootstrapped using 2000 iterations. We report bias and accelerated (BCa) confidence intervals and the accompanying   P   values (  P  ) as they account for bias and skewness in the data and provide a more robust estimate of the association that is less reliant on the distribution of the variable. All assumptions of multiple regression analyses, including homoscedasticity of residuals, were assessed and met. We performed separate analyses for the network measures on the global level and on the subnetwork level. On the subnetwork level, type I errors due to multiple comparisons were minimized using the False Discovery Rate [FDR,   q   < 0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg  )]. Statistical significance was set to   P   < 0.05 for all analyses. No formal power analysis was conducted prior to the execution of this study. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Sample characteristics and behavioral results \n  \nOf the 69 participants with an available ToL task and rs-fMRI data, seven had to be excluded (see Fig.  ), which resulted in a total sample size of 62 participants, aged between 21 and 74 years old (  M   = 48.1 ± 13.9, 33 males). The time between performing the ToL task and the rs-fMRI was on average 6.2 ± 4.6 (range 0–21) days. See Table   for the sample characteristics. Age showed a positive correlation with reaction time (  r   = 0.498,   P   < 0.001) but only a trend-level negative correlation with accuracy (  r   = − 0.243,   P   = 0.057) indicating that older participants tended to respond slower and slightly less accurately. The average motion during rs-fMRI (expressed as mean relative RMS framewise displacement) was 0.068 ± 0.029 (range 0.027–0.17) and was positively correlated with age (  r   = 0.34,   P   = 0.007) but not performance on the ToL (reaction time:   r   = 0.06,   P   = 0.66; accuracy:   r   = − 0.18,   P   = 0.12).   \nFlowchart of participant exclusion \n    \nSample characteristics \n  \nMissing for two subjects \n\nMissing for one subject \n  \n\n\n### Global topology \n  \nGlobal efficiency (  β   = 0.22,   P   = 0.04) but not Gcc (  β   = − 0.09,   P   = 0.57) was positively associated with reaction time above and beyond the effects of age (see Table   and Fig.  ). There were no significant associations with accuracy. Adding sex or education level as a nuisance covariate to the model had no effect on these results.   \nAssociations between TOL performance and global network measures \n  \nFor each analysis, age was entered in model 1, the network measure in model 2 and motion parameters in model 3. Only the results of model 3 are shown here.

These associations did not, however, survive the multiple comparison correction (DMN efficiency   P   = 0.072; DMN clustering:   P   = 0.077). Adding sex or education level as additional nuisance covariate to the model had no effect on the results. Consistent with the results on the global level, there were no significant associations with the accuracy of task performance (Supplemental Table 3). \n\n\n### Between-subnetwork connectivity \n  \nFC between the DMN and FPN (  β   = 0.23,   P   = 0.04), the DAN (  β   = 0.21,   P   = 0.04) and the VAN (  β   = 0.20,   P   = 0.04) were all positively associated with reaction time. These associations did not survive the FDR correction for multiple comparisons (all   P   = 0.09; supplemental Tables 4 and 5). \n\n\n### Post-hoc analyses \n  \nBecause of possible floor/ceiling effects during the less demanding 1, 2 and 3 step trials of the ToL task, we re-ran the regression models using only the mean accuracy rates and reaction times during ToL steps 4 and 5. These post-hoc analyses showed that at the global level reaction time—but not accuracy—was still associated with global efficiency (  β   = 0.27,   P   = 0.04), not Gcc (  β   = − 0.09,   P   = 0.59). At the subnetwork level, efficiency of the DMN (  β   = 0.41,   P   = 0.001) and FPN (  β   = 0.32,   P   = 0.045), clustering of the DMN (  β   = 0.33,   P   = 0.05) and FC between the DMN and FPN (  β   = 0.38,   P   = 0.02) were all positively associated with reaction time, after FDR correction for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study in 62 healthy adults with a wide age range we investigated the association between network topology during a rs-fMRI session and cognitive planning ability during a ToL task that was performed outside the scanner. We observed that global (whole-brain) efficiency was associated with reduced planning speed and that this effect was mainly driven by the FC of the DMN. The results were independent from inter-individual differences in age, gender, education level and motion during rs-fMRI. Post-hoc analyses showed that our results were strongest when focusing on the higher task load trials of the ToL task (four and five step trials). \n\nGlobal efficiency provides a measure of how well-integrated a network is and how easily information can travel from one node to another on the other side of the network, while the clustering coefficient is a measure of how well-connected nodes are locally into segregated triangles of neighboring nodes. Both measures are often used to describe the characteristics of a network and abnormalities in these network measures are commonly observed in the structural and functional networks of patients with a brain disorder (Bullmore and Sporns  ; Griffa et al.  ; Worbe  ; Lord et al.  ). Here we observed that subjects with a higher global efficiency show slower planning performance on the ToL task. This finding is at odds with our hypothesis and previous studies that observed that higher global efficiency is associated with higher global intelligence (van den Heuvel et al.  ; Sheffield et al.  ) and performance on working memory tasks (Cohen and D'Esposito  ; Sheffield et al.  ). One other study has also previously found that a higher global efficiency was associated with worse performance on a working memory task, but only in older adults and only when focusing on task-based FC (Stanley et al.  ). This is the first study, however, to investigate planning ability. One possible, albeit less plausible, explanation might, therefore, be that planning requires a different whole-brain network organization than working memory tasks or general intelligence. Alternatively, the higher global efficiency in individuals with slower performance on the ToL task may also point towards a more random network (Ajilore et al.  ). As there was no association between ToL task speed and lower global clustering (a characteristic feature of random networks), this explanation is also less viable. \n\nStudies have shown that, although the resting-state provides a core and intrinsic network architecture that highly overlaps with the network topology of task-states (Cole et al.  ; Krienen et al.  ), significant reorganization does take place during the execution of tasks, and the magnitude and spatial redistribution depends on the task and its load (Cohen and D'Esposito  ; Davison et al.  ). Furthermore, the ease with which a network can reconfigure from rest to task-states correlates with task performance and general cognition (Braun et al.  ; Bassett et al.  ; Telesford et al.  ; Hearne et al.  ). Transitions of rest to (demanding) task-states have generally been associated with an increase in global efficiency, signifying a better integrated network (Cohen and D'Esposito  ; Hearne et al.  ; Shine et al.  ; see Shine and Poldrack   for a review). This increase in network integration is, however, not unconstrained, as a fully integrated functional network would lead to epileptic seizures and violates the principles of cost-efficiency (Shine and Poldrack  ; Bullmore and Sporns  ). Assuming that in our subjects network integration would similarly increase from the resting-state to task-state, i.e., execution of the ToL task, it is conceivable that global efficiency could not increase sufficiently in those subjects with an already highly integrated network during the resting-state to meet task demands, leading to a slower behavioral response. This concept is schematically depicted in Fig.  . Although this hypothesis receives indirect support from multiple previous studies on dynamic network reconfigurations (Shine and Poldrack  ), we unfortunately did not acquire fMRI scans during the execution of the ToL task and, therefore, this explanation currently remains speculative. Because the slower responses were not associated with lower accuracy (  r   = − 0.19,   P   = 0.13) and we did not observe an association between network topology and accuracy, our results may not be specific for planning performance but may also be related to an overall slower information processing speed. Why we did not find an association with task accuracy is currently unclear.   \nSchematic representation of rest-to-task reconfiguration hypothesis. The figure shows three fictional subjects that transition from a resting-state to task state and show a concomitant increase in (global) efficiency. The top two subjects, already have such a high efficiency during resting-state that when the brain network needs to reconfigure to a more integrated state to meet task demands, efficiency cannot surpass the ceiling (horizontal dotted lines) and leads to slower responses \n  \n\nAt the subnetwork level, we showed that our global results were mainly driven by inter-individual differences in FC of the DMN; both the topology of the DMN and FC between the DMN and the other RSNs (mainly the FPN) were associated with slower task performance. Because closer inspection showed that efficiency and clustering of the DMN were highly correlated (  r   = 0.84), the observed positive associations should instead be interpreted as an association between slower performance and increased within DMN FC. Indeed, when looking at total FC within the DMN, we observed a positive association (  β   = 0.25,   P   = 0.02) with ToL reaction time. It is generally accepted that activity within the DMN is high when a subject is not engaged in any specific task and its activity is suppressed when external stimuli demand cognitive engagement (Anticevic et al.  ). Heightened DMN activity and higher FC between the DMN and other RSNs are also commonly associated with reduced cognitive performance in brain disorder-related deficits (Putcha et al.  ; Esposito et al.  ; Anticevic et al.  ). Our associations between slower ToL performance and increased within DMN FC and increased connectivity between the DMN and the other RSNs is therefore in line with these findings and adds to the growing body of literature that shows that inter-individual differences in FC of the DMN is associated with cognitive performance, even in normally functioning healthy subjects. It must be noted that these associations did not survive the multiple comparison correction, although the reported associations between performance speed at higher task load and within DMN FC and FC between DMN and FPN in our post-hoc analysis did pass the FDR correction. \n\nIn recent years, scientific awareness has increased for the low reproducibility of neuroimaging findings (Nichols et al.  ). Test–retest reliability is often used as a measure for reproducibility and generalizability. Although graph measures, such as global efficiency and Gcc, show fair-to-good test–retest reliability (Welton et al.  ), a recent meta-analysis showed that edges within a functional connectivity matrix—on the basis of which graph measures are calculated—show poor test–retest reliability (Noble et al.  ). This low test–retest reliability influences statistical power and necessitates the inclusion of larger samples to reach the effect size of interest (Matheson  ; Zuo et al.  ). It is, however, important to note that test–retest reliability is not the same as validity and the meta-analysis showed that one of the main factors that influenced test–retest reliability was artefact correction (Noble et al.  ); a necessary step during preprocessing to remove motion and other non-neural physiological noise from the data and avoid spurious results (Parkes et al.  ). Moreover, although absolute values of intra-individual edges show low reproducibility (Noble et al.  ), inter-individual differences in the functional connectome are stable across, days, months and even years (Horien et al.  ; Finn et al.  ; Miranda-Dominguez et al.  ), and its characteristics are uniquely associated with a particular individual across time (Horien et al.  ). This provides justification for predicting a person’s phenotype, including cognitive functioning, on the basis of between-subject variability of the functional connectome. Another part of reproducibility is transparent and complete reporting of the methods and results. To that end, we report the COBIDAS checklist in the supplementary material (Nichols et al.  ). We will make the here reported data available to researchers upon reasonable request. \n\nA limitation of this study is that we exclusively looked at resting-state FC to predict performance on the ToL and not—at task-based FC, i.e. during the execution of the ToL itself. This would have allowed us to look directly at the network characteristics associated with performance and to test our hypothesis of reduced ability to network integration when transitioning from rest to task. Furthermore, although conscious state may alter network topology, we did not include an objective measure to ensure wakefulness during the eyes-closed resting-state scan. A strength of this study is that we retrospectively recruited a relatively large number of healthy subjects and used stringent control for (micro)motion by excluding subjects with > 0.2 mm mean RMS displacement, denoising rs-fMRI for motion-related artifacts with ICA-AROMA, employing wavelet coherence to construct the connectivity matrices and adding RMS displacement to the regression model. \n\nIn conclusion, we showed that higher global efficiency during rest and higher FC of the DMN with other RSNs and within itself is associated with slower planning performance. We tentatively postulate that due to ceiling effects individuals with a higher integrative network state during rest are less able to reconfigure to a more integrated state during task execution, leading to slower exchange across the brain network and slower behavioral responses. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"2bb7dbe5670e5be0adcd34eaf3d6c259"},

A few neuroimaging studies have demonstrated seasonal effects, but were limited by their cross‐sectional design or sample sizes. Most importantly, the stability of the MRI scanner has not been taken into account, which may also be affected by environments. In the current study, we analyzed longitudinal resting‐state functional MRI (fMRI) data from eight individuals, where they were scanned over months to years. We applied machine learning regression to use different resting‐state parameters, including the amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity matrix, to predict different weather and environmental parameters. For careful control, the raw EPI and the anatomical images were also used for predictions. We first found that daylight length and air temperatures could be reliably predicted with cross‐validation using the resting‐state parameters. However, similar prediction accuracies could also be achieved by using one frame of EPI image, and even higher accuracies could be achieved by using the segmented or raw anatomical images. Finally, the signals outside of the brain in the anatomical images and signals in phantom scans could also achieve higher prediction accuracies, suggesting that the predictability may be due to the baseline signals of the MRI scanner. After all, we did not identify detectable influences of weather on brain functions other than the influences on the baseline signals of MRI scanners. The results highlight the difficulty of studying long‐term effects using MRI. \n  \nBy using machine learning regression, we showed that we could predict daily daylight length and air temperature from different resting‐state fMRI parameters. However, a careful control analysis showed that MRI signals from structural MRI, and even in a phantom, could also predict the environmental parameters. The prediction likely arises from MRI baseline signal changes rather than   bona fide   functional brain changes, which highlights the difficulty of studying long‐term effects using MRI.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nDaily environmental factors such as weather and seasonality affect mood and cognitive functions (Cedeño Laurent et al.,  ; Denissen, Butalid, Penke, & van Aken,  ; IJzerman et al.,  ; Keller et al.,  ; Lim et al.,  ), and may lead to pathological affective disorder (Elseoud et al.,  ; Kurlansik & Ibay,  ). The effects on individuals may be small, but the collective effects may lead to broader impacts, for example, on stock markets (Hirshleifer & Shumway,  ; Saunders,  ). To better understand the effects of weather and seasonality on mood or cognition, it is critical to study their effects on brain functions. A few human neuroimaging studies have explored this association. Seasonal effects on brain functions as measured by functional MRI (fMRI) have been observed both in resting‐state (Choe et al.,  ) and when performing cognitive tasks (Meyer et al.,  ). Some neural transmitter activity in the striatum also showed seasonal effects, that is, serotonin transmitter binding as measured by  C–labeled 3‐amino‐4‐(2‐dimethylaminomethyl‐phenylsulfanyl)‐benzonitrile ([ C]DASB) positron emission tomography (PET) (Kalbitzer et al.,  ; Mc Mahon et al.,  ; Praschak‐Rieder, Willeit, Wilson, Houle, & Meyer,  ) and dopamine synthesis as measured by  F‐DOPA PET (Eisenberg et al.,  ; Kaasinen, Jokinen, Joutsa, Eskola, & Rinne,  ). A study even reported seasonal changes of hippocampal volumes in human subjects (Miller et al.,  ). \n\nThere are several limitations in these neuroimaging studies. First, most of these studies are cross‐sectional, which is limited by the large individual differences in brain functions (Gordon et al.,  ). In addition, most of the studies examined roughly defined seasonal effects or yearly periodical effects. But the exact phase of the seasonal variations may be different from the four seasons. Sometimes the yearly effects showed different phases (Meyer et al.,  ), suggesting more complicated relationships of environmental factors on brain functions. Therefore, it is critical to examine which environmental parameters, such as weather, have more contributions to the seasonal effects. Among different environmental parameters, daylight length and temperature represent the significant environmental differences in seasonal fluctuations. Gillihan et al. have explored the weather effects on brain functions using a small cross‐sectional sample (Gillihan, Detre, Farah, & Rao,  ). They identified a weather index related to mood and showed that the weather index was correlated with resting‐state cerebral blood flow as measured by arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion fMRI mainly in the insula. But more systematic examinations of weather effects on brain functions have not been performed. Lastly, the most commonly used neuroimaging method is fMRI based on blood‐oxygen‐level dependent (BOLD) signals (Ogawa, Lee, Kay, & Tank,  ), where the interpretation of the results should consider neuronal level, neurophysiological level, and the underlying physical level of the scanner. Specifically, if some effects on fMRI signals were observed, they may be due to the changes in neuronal activity, which is favorable to psychologists and psychiatrists. But the effects may also due to the changes in neurovascular coupling (Di, Kannurpatti, Rypma, & Biswal,  ; Yuan et al.,  ), in brain structures, or even the stability of the MRI scanner. Therefore, when examining the weather effects on brain functions, alternative factors need to be considered and carefully controlled. \n\nThe purpose of the current study is to estimate to what extent resting‐state brain functions are affected by the weather. We analyzed longitudinal resting‐state fMRI data from eight individuals from three datasets, where the individuals were scanned over periods of months to years (Choe et al.,  ; Filevich et al.,  ; Poldrack et al.,  ). One challenge for estimating weather effects is that the effects may be small. Therefore, we applied a machine learning regression approach to evaluate the effects. Because multiple brain regions have been implicated in seasonal effects, for example, basal ganglia (Kalbitzer et al.,  ; Mc Mahon et al.,  ; Praschak‐Rieder et al.,  ), insula (Gillihan et al.,  ), and hippocampus (Miller et al.,  ), small regional effects may be aggregated into detectable effects using machine learning technique. We performed a within‐subject prediction analysis at the single‐subject level. We asked what weather parameters have the most effects on resting‐state brain functions, which can be represented as high prediction accuracies in predictions of these parameters. In order to rule out possible confounding effects, we also performed several control prediction analyses. First, we analyzed anatomical MRI images to check whether the observed prediction could be attributed to anatomical variations. Second, we checked images from phantom data to examine whether the prediction could be attributed to the stability of the MRI scanner. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n###  MRI   datasets \n  \nSeveral multi‐session resting‐state fMRI datasets were pooled together, where the subjects were scanned over periods of months to years. The first subject was derived from the Kirby sample (Choe et al.,  ), where the single subject was scanned for 156 sessions over three and half years. The second subject was from the Myconnectome sample (Poldrack et al.,  ), where the subject was scanned 90 times over one and half years. The remaining six subjects were from the Day2day sample (Filevich et al.,  ), where the subjects were scanned over a similar span of about half a year. The detailed subject and scan information is listed in Table  . \n  \nSubject and MRI scan information \n    \nThe MRI data from the Kirby sample were scanned using a 3T Philips Achieva scanner. The data from the Myconnectome sample were scanned using a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner using a 32‐channel head coil. And the data from the Day2day project were scanned using a 3T Siemens Magnetom Trio scanner using a 12‐channel head coil. For each subject, resting‐state fMRI data with multiple sessions were acquired. Within a subject, the resting‐state fMRI were scanned using the same imaging parameters, but the parameters varied between different sites. Some essential resting‐state fMRI parameters are listed in Table  . For more details, we refer the readers to the original articles. \n\nHigh‐resolution anatomical MRI images were available for only a few sessions in the Kirby and Myconnectome datasets. An MRI image of one session was used to register all the functional images to standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. For the Day2day dataset, structural MRI images were available for all the sessions. Only the structural MRI image of the last session of each subject was used to aid preprocessing of the fMRI images. All the structural images of the Day2day project were also used in the control prediction analysis. \n\nLastly, we obtained MRI scanner quality assurance agar phantom data from the Day2day site. The images were scanned between June 2013 and February 2014 on a weekly basis (37 sessions in total). One session's data were dropped because of extreme variations in the images. The data were acquired using a gradient echo (GRE) sequence with the same coil as the one used for the acquisition of the human data. Two images were acquired for each session. The parameters include: TR = 2,000 ms; TE = 30 ms; FOV = 22 cm; matrix = 64 × 64; slice number = 28; slice thickness = 4 mm (1 mm gap). \n\n\n### Environmental data \n  \nThe MRI data were acquired from three different cities in two continents, Baltimore, USA (Kirby), Austin, USA (Myconnectome), and Berlin Germany (Day2day), which reflect different types of climates. The latitudes of these three cities are approximately 39°N, 30°N, and 52°N, respectively. The weather data for the two U.S. cities were downloaded from (U.S.) National Centers for Environmental Information website ( ). The Local Climatological Data from Maryland Science Center Station and Austin Camp Mabry Station were used to represent the weather for the Kirby and Myconnectome datasets, respectively. We used the following measures, maximum and minimum temperatures (Temp  and Temp ), air pressure (Press), wind speed (Wind), humidity (Hum), and precipitation (Prcp). For those with missing data, we also checked Daily Summaries data from the NOAA website. The weather data for the Day2day dataset were collected by the German researchers. Daily sunshine hours were not used, because they were not available for the other datasets. \n\nWe also included daylight length (Dalgt) in the current analysis. It was already available in the NOAA Local Climatological Data. For the Day2day data, we calculated the daylight length in Berlin according to its geographic location through the website of the Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory computes ( ). For the Day2day dataset, there are three additional parameters that reflect local environmental variations, that is, scanner room temperature (Temp ), humidity (Hum ), and scanner Helium level (He). These three parameters were also used in the prediction analysis when using the Day2day data. \n\n\n###  MRI   data processing \n  \n#### Resting‐state   fMRI   preprocessing \n  \nData processing and statistical analysis were performed using MATLAB (R2017b). SPM12 ( ; RRID:SCR_007037) was used for fMRI data preprocessing. The first 2, 18, and 2 functional images for each session were discarded for the Kirby, Myconnectome, and Day2day datasets, respectively, remaining 198, 500, and 148 images for each session. For each subject, all the functional images were realigned to the first session. All the prediction analysis was performed in the native space of each subject. The anatomical images were coregistered to the mean functional image, and then segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and other tissues. For each subject, an intracranial volume mask was defined, and the grand mean (4‐dimensional average) of the functional images was calculated for each session. For each session, the functional images were divided by the grand mean and multiplied by 100. At each voxel, Friston's 24 head motion model (Friston, Williams, Howard, Frackowiak, & Turner,  ), the first five principal components from WM signals and the first five principal components from CSF signals were regressed out, and then band‐pass filtering was applied between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz. The images were not spatially smoothed, because there was no voxel‐wise univariate analysis involved. \n\nThe preprocessing steps were chosen to minimize potential artifacts due to physiological noises and head motion. This may be an over‐conservative choice that may compromise too many degrees of freedom of the fMRI time series (Bright, Tench, & Murphy,  ). We also tried to reduce the number of regressors during the linear regression step. Specifically, we obtained the first two principal components of Friston's 24 head motion variables. The regression then included the first two components of the head motion model, the first component of WM signals, and the first component of the CSF signals (2 + 1 + 1 regressors compared with 24 + 5 + 5 regressors from the main analysis). The results using the reduced regression were reported in the  . \n\n\n####  ALFF  ,   ReHo  , and connectivity matrices \n  \nWe calculated three resting‐state parameters to represent resting‐state brain functions, that is, amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuation (ALFF) (Zang et al.,  ) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) (Zang, Jiang, Lu, He, & Tian,  ) to represent regional properties, and connectivity matrix to represent inter‐regional connectivity property. ALFF and ReHo were calculated using the REST toolbox (REST: a toolkit for resting‐state fMRI, RRID:SCR_009641) (Song et al.,  ). Essentially, ALFF calculated the power of the time series signals between 0.01 to 0.08 Hz at every voxel, resulting in an ALFF map for each session. ReHo calculated the correlations of the current voxel with the 26 neighboring voxels, which also resulted in a ReHo map for each session. The ALFF and ReHo values for each session within the subject's GM mask were converted to a vector for further analysis. The subject‐specific GM masks were defined as GM intensity greater than 0.5 based on the segmentation of the subject's anatomical image. Because the GM masks were defined in the native spaces and the fMRI resolution varies across datasets, the number of within mask voxels also varied (from 20,780 to 55,368). \n\nCorrelation matrices were calculated among 164 regions of interest (Di & Biswal,  ; Dosenbach et al.,  ). Spherical ROIs were first defined in MNI space with a radius of 8 mm, and then transformed into the native space for each subject. There were in total 13,366 connectivity values (164 × [164–1]/2), which were converted to a vector for the prediction analysis. The correlation values were transformed into Fishers'   z   scores. \n\n\n#### Head motion and other potential confounding variables \n  \nTo minimize the confounding of head motion in the prediction analysis, we first removed sessions with large head motions. We calculated frame‐wise displacement in translation and rotation directions (Di & Biswal,  ). A session's data with maximum frame‐wise displacement greater than 1 mm or 1° were discarded. No sessions were removed in the Kirby data, and seven sessions (7.8%) were removed for the Myconnectome data. In the Day2day dataset, at most two sessions were removed for each subject. Secondly, we regressed out 24 motion variables using Friston's head motion model, which has been shown to be effective to minimize the effects of head motion on resting‐state measures (Yan et al.,  ). Lastly, mean frame‐wise displacement of both directions were regressed out from a predicted environmental variable before it was entered into the prediction analysis. \n\n\n#### Global signal \n  \nThe resting‐state fMRI data have been scaled by the grand mean (4‐D average) of each session to account for the baseline signal variations across sessions. However, a recent study has reported an association between global signal fluctuations and time of day (Orban, Kong, Li, Chee, & Yeo,  ). We, therefore, examined whether the global signal fluctuations were associated with the environmental factors, and whether accounting for the global signal fluctuations could affect the predictions of these environmental factors. We calculated the averaged ALFF value in the intracranial mask to reflect the global signal fluctuations. The global signal fluctuations were correlated with daylight length for each subject. Next, we also calculated mean ALFF (mALFF) by dividing an ALFF map by the global mean. Prediction analysis was also performed by using the mALFF maps. \n\n\n#### Structural   MRI   processing \n  \nFor the Day2day dataset, the MPRAGE anatomical MRI images were available for all the sessions. Therefore, we used the anatomical images as a control condition for the weather prediction. The analysis was also performed in a subject's native space. The anatomical images from all the sessions of a subject were realigned and resliced to the image of the first session. Then each session's image was segmented separately, and the segmented tissue probability maps of GM, WM, and CSF were obtained. We defined GM, WM, and CSF masks as an averaged probability greater than 0.5 for the respective tissue types. GM, WM, and CSF probability in their masks were extracted, respectively, to be used in the prediction analysis. \n\nWe also defined an air mask to study the baseline MRI signals, which was located outside the brain (Makedonov, Black, & MacIntosh,  ). The mask was placed at the lower left front side of the head to avoid potential objects in the area, and was consisted of 21 × 41 × 41 voxels. \n\n\n#### Phantom image processing \n  \nFor each session, the two images were realigned, and an averaged image was calculated. Because the phantom was imaged in a similar location, no cross‐session registration was performed. We first calculated the correlations between daylight length and image values in every voxel, resulting in a correlation image. Next, a cubic mask in the center of the image was defined. The signals within the mask were extracted for the prediction analysis. \n\n\n\n### Prediction analysis \n  \n#### Prediction analysis scheme \n  \nThe goal of the analysis is to estimate the prediction values of resting‐state parameters on different weather or meteorological parameters. The analysis was performed for each of the resting‐state parameters to predict each of the seven weather parameters. And we asked which weather parameters could be better predicted by which resting‐state parameters. The prediction analysis was all done in a within‐subject manner. Cross‐validation was used to evaluate the prediction accuracies. \n\nIn addition to use these resting‐state parameters, we also performed a series of control analyses to use other potential confounding parameters to predict the environmental parameters. First, we used the first fMRI image of each session after realignment to perform prediction analysis. Although the single image still reflects BOLD effects, brain structures may contribute more variations. Secondly, to future rule out the structural contribution, we used segmented tissue probabilities of GM, WM, and CSF from their respective tissue masks to perform prediction analysis. Thirdly, we also extracted the raw image values from the MPRAGE images in the three tissue masks to serve as another control condition. In addition, a cuboid mask was defined for each subject, which was located outside the brain. The raw image values from the MPRAGE images from the air mask were used to control for baseline MRI signals. Finally, since all of the above‐mentioned analyses indicated prediction values to predict environmental parameters, especially daylight length, we further analyzed the quality assurance phantom data, and used the signals in the agar phantom area to perform prediction analysis to predict daylight length. \n\n\n#### Machine learning regression analysis \n  \nWe used a linear machine learning regression model to perform prediction analysis. The general form of the prediction model is a linear regression model as the following: where   y   is a   n   ×   1   vector of a predicted weather parameter,   X   is a   n   ×   m   matrix of a resting‐state parameter,   β   is the model parameters, and   ε   is the residual.   N   represents the number of observations, which in the current analysis is the number of sessions for a particular subject.   M   represents the number of prediction variables, which could be the number of voxels in the ALFF or ReHo maps (see Table  ) or the number of connections (13,366) in the connectivity matrices. Here, m is much larger than   n  . Therefore, we used ridge regression to estimate the   β   parameters. Briefly speaking, instead of trying to achieve the goal of minimizing the sum of square means of the model prediction: \n\nRidge regression adds one more regularized term: where   λ   represents the regularization parameter. The regularization term can constrain the sizes of beta values, thus preventing overfitting of the model. In the current analysis, we used the MATLAB function fitrlinear to perform the prediction analysis. There are other methods available, such as LASSO and elastic net, but a recent study suggested that ridge regression and elastic net can yield similar prediction accuracies while LASSO might perform worse in the scenario that the number of observations is much smaller than the number of features (Cui & Gong,  ). \n\nThere are three steps in the prediction analysis, (a) tuning the regularization parameter   λ   to find the optimal   λ   (  λ   tuning), (b) training the model using the training dataset and the optimal   λ   to obtain a prediction model β (model training), and (c) estimating prediction accuracy by calculating the correlations between predicted and actual values in a separate testing sample (cross‐validation). Cross‐validation was used to make sure that the estimated prediction accuracies were independent of the training data. \n\nBecause of the limited number of data in one fold (13 observations in the least case), three‐fold cross‐validation was adopted. We used a nested tuning strategy to optimize the parameter   λ   (Cui & Gong,  ). Specifically, we first held out one‐third of the data as an independent testing dataset, and used the remaining two‐thirds of the data as a training and parameter tuning dataset. The data were first sorted according to the tested weather parameter, and the three folds were defined as the 1st, 4th, 7th, …, 2nd, 5th, 8th, …, and 3rd, 6th, 9th, … sessions of the data, respectively. Within the two‐thirds training and parameter tuning dataset, we first performed a nested loop of three‐fold analysis. Specifically, one‐third of the data were holden out, and the remaining two‐thirds of data were used to train the regression model using a set of   λ   values, from 10  to 10  in the logarithmic scale with a total of 15 values. The inner loop testing data was used to test the accuracy of the prediction by calculating the correlation between predicted and actual weather parameter values. This procedure was performed three times for the three folds, and the mean accuracies were calculated for each of the   λ   values. The   λ   value with the highest mean accuracy was used for the outer layer training data to train the model. The model was then applied to the outer layer testing data to estimate prediction accuracies. The three accuracy values from the three folds were averaged to represent an estimate of accuracy for a subject. \n\nThe prediction accuracies of different imaging parameters and environmental parameters were visualized by using notBoxPlot ( ). The plot shows not only the individuals' prediction accuracies, but also the mean,   SD  , and 95% confidence interval of the accuracies across the subjects. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple comparisons of the different parameters. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Predictions using the resting‐state images \n  \nWe first performed predictions on different environmental parameters using the ALFF maps, ReHo maps, connectivity matrices, as well as using a single frame of EPI images as a control condition (Figure  ). In general, daylight length (Dalgt) and maximum and minimum environmental temperatures (Temp  and Temp ) had higher prediction accuracies, with daylight length usually having the highest prediction accuracies. The other environmental parameters had very low prediction accuracies. In terms of the resting‐state parameters, the ALFF map usually had the highest prediction values. The average prediction accuracy of daylight length using ALFF was 0.38. Surprisingly, however, using a single frame of EPI images could achieve comparable and even higher prediction accuracies than any resting‐state parameters. The averaged prediction accuracy of daylight length using the raw EPI images was 0.42. When using the resting‐state parameters calculated from the reduced preprocessing method to perform the predictions, the prediction accuracies slightly increased ( ). However, they were still smaller than those using the raw EPI images. \n  \nPrediction accuracies (correlations) of the amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuations (ALFF) maps, regional homogeneity (ReHo) maps, connectivity matrices, and raw echo‐planar imaging (EPI) maps on different environmental parameters.

The asterisks on the top represent statistical significance at   p   < .05 after false discovery rate (FDR) correction for all the 40 predictions \n  \nIt remains a question that whether the weather predictions using the resting‐state parameters and single EPI images are based on similar or different information. Since the daylight length had the highest prediction accuracies, we focused on its prediction. We combined ALFF with EPI and ReHo with EPI to predict daylight length to check whether combining the two modalities can boost the prediction accuracies. Unfortunately, combing the two modalities yielded very similar prediction accuracies as those using the single EPI images or ALFF images (Figure  ). Therefore, ALFF and ReHo did not convey more information than a single EPI image to predict daylight length. \n  \nPrediction accuracies to daylight length using the amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), raw echo‐planar imaging (EPI) maps, and their combinations. Each dot represents one subject's mean prediction accuracy. The center white lines, inner dark bars, and outer light bars represent the mean, 95% confidence interval, and   SD  , respectively \n  \nNext, we examined whether the global signal fluctuations of the resting‐state data were correlated with daylight lengths, and whether the global signal fluctuations contribute to the predictions of the environmental factors. The correlations between global mean ALFF and daylight lengths did not show a consistent pattern across subjects (Figure  ). We also used the global mean scaled ALFF maps, that is, mALFF, to predict different environmental variables, and they yielded similar prediction patterns as what using the raw ALFF maps (Figure  ). \n  \n(a) Correlations between the global amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and daylight lengths.

The center line, inner dark bar, and outer light bar represent the mean, 95% confidence interval, and standard deviation, respectively \n  \n\n### Predictions using the anatomical images \n  \nIf a single volume of EPI image can predict weather parameters like daylight length, then the question becomes whether the prediction is due to brain functional activity, structural information, or other factors. We, therefore, performed similar prediction analyses using the anatomical images, which are available in the six subjects in the Day2day dataset. We first performed predictions using the segmented GM, WM, or CSF density images within their respective tissue masks (Figure  ). The results showed very similar prediction patterns for different environmental parameters as what using the resting‐state parameters. That is, the daylight length and environmental temperatures had the highest prediction accuracies. The prediction accuracies using all the three tissue probability maps were above 0.5, which were higher than using any of the resting‐state parameters. However, what was more interesting was that even higher prediction accuracies could be achieved using the raw MRI signals in these tissue masks. The prediction accuracies were higher than 0.6 when using raw MRI signals in the GM and CSF masks. Finally, we defined a cuboid mask outside the brain (see Figure   as an example), and used the raw MRI signals in the mask to perform prediction analysis. Surprisingly, the analysis also showed a similar pattern of prediction accuracies. The prediction accuracy on daylight length using the air mask was 0.47, which was lower than using all the other anatomical parameters but still higher than using any of the resting‐state parameters. \n  \nPrediction accuracies (correlations) of raw MRI signals and segmented densities in gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and air masks on different environmental parameters.

(c) There is an extremely high negative correlation between the mean correlations in the air mask and the prediction accuracies of using the air mask voxels to predict daylight length \n  \nTo further explore the baseline MRI signals conveyed in the air mask, we calculated the correlations between the MRI signals and daylight length in all the voxels in the air mask for the six subjects (Figure  ). There were small global effects of the correlations between the MRI signals and daylight lengths. Moreover, the global effects of correlations were strongly correlated with the prediction accuracies across subjects (Figure  ), indicating that the global correlation is the driving information that gave rise to the prediction accuracy. \n\n\n### Control analysis using the phantom images \n  \nTo further confirm the baseline signal changes, we analyzed the weekly quality control phantom data around the same period of the Day2day project. We first calculated voxel‐wise correlations between the MRI signal and daylight lengths (Figure  ). It clearly showed that in the phantom region, there were high negative correlations. We defined a cubic mask in the center of the image, and the distribution of correlations of all the voxels in the mask is plotted in Figure  . The mean and median correlation in the cubic mask was   −0  .  78   and   −0  .  79  , respectively. We also performed similar predictions of the daylight length by using the MRI signals in the mask, and the cross‐validated mean accuracy was   0  .  70  . Lastly, we calculated the mean and spatial coefficient of variation of the MRI signals in the mask, and plotted them against scan sessions (Figure  ). The mean MRI signals showed a strong negative correlation with daylight lengths (  r = −0  .  82  ,   p <   .  001  ). However, the spatial coefficient of variation showed only a marginally significant correlation (  r =−0  .  34  ,   p =   .  04  ). The large negative correlation of daylight length with the mean MRI signals and reduced correlation with the spatial coefficient of variation were also confirmed by using the air mask signals of the human subjects' MPRAGE images ( ). \n  \n(a) Voxel‐wise correlation maps between MRI image values and daylight length.

However, a series of controlled analyses showed that using a single EPI image, the segmented tissue density, and the raw MRI signals from the anatomical images in different tissue masks and even in a mask outside the brain could all predict the environmental parameters. The resting‐state parameters did not add prediction values to single‐volume EPI images. These results indicated the prediction of environmental parameters, especially daylight length, cannot be explained as the weather effects on brain functions. Rather, the prediction may reflect MRI scanner baseline signal variations that were affected by the environmental parameters. The analysis of the quality control phantom images supported our speculation. \n\nAmong all the environmental parameters analyzed the daylight length and air temperature had the highest prediction accuracies. It is not surprising because daylight length and air temperature are highly correlated. Daylight length has the highest prediction accuracy probably because it is a physical quantity that does not have measurement errors, which is in contrast to air temperature. It is noteworthy that although the MRI scanner room temperature and humidity could not be predicted by the functional parameters, they could be reliably predicted by the anatomical MRI parameters (Figure  ). However, their prediction accuracies were smaller than those of daylight length and air temperature. It indicates that the environmental effects on MRI signals are not directly caused by local temperature, but some other local factors. A study has shown that the gaseous oxygen level in the magnet field can influence the MRI signals (Bates et al.,  ). The oxygen level in the scanner room may fluctuate across seasons due to different ventilation conditions, which may contribute to the MRI baseline signal shifts. In addition, the cooling systems of the scanner may be affected by either electricity supply stability or cooling water temperature. Given that the MRI is such a sophisticated machine, there may be other factors that mediate the association between daylight length and scanner stability. \n\nThe current results highlighted the difficulty to study long‐term effects such as weather on brain structures and functions using MRI. Consistent with two previous fMRI studies (Choe et al.,  ; Meyer et al.,  ), we did find weather effects on fMRI measures. But we demonstrated that the weather effects are likely due to the variations of MRI scanner baseline. It is reasonable to speculate that MRI scanner stability might contribute to the reported seasonal effects (Choe et al.,  ; Meyer et al.,  ). We also showed that tissue probability measures of GM volumes may also be affected by the scanner stability, so brain volumetric measures may also be affected by the scanner stability (Miller et al.,  ). Careful examinations of the effects of MRI scanner baseline signals are needed to confirm these reported findings. \n\nIn the current analysis, a few steps have been used to correct the MRI baseline signals. The fMRI signals have been scaled by the grand mean of each session. And we also compared the prediction accuracies of using ALFF and mALFF, which have yielded very few differences. The scaling may be effective for local voxels. But due to the spatial heterogeneity, the baseline variability may still present in some brain regions, which could be picked up by the machine learning algorithm. ReHo and connectivity measures use correlation measures, which are insensitive or have scaled local signal variability. This may explain why their prediction accuracies are smaller than ALFF. These problems may arise from the fact that most of the fMRI measures are relative measures. If absolute measures can be used, for example, blood perfusion using arterial spin labeling (ASL) (Detre, Leigh, Williams, & Koretsky,  ; Detre, Rao, Wang, Chen, & Wang,  ), then the effects from scanner stability may be minimized. \n\nThe current analysis demonstrated that machine learning is a powerful method that can pick up small effects. The phantom data showed the correlations between baseline MRI signals and daylight length were about 0.7. When scanning human participants, the background MRI signals outside the brain showed much smaller correlations with daylight length (Figure  ). However, we could still achieve a similar level as the prediction accuracies by using machine learning as the phantom data (Figure  ). Indeed, the cross‐validated prediction accuracies were between 0.6 and 0.7, which are very close to the correlation in the phantom data. Machine learning methods have become more and more popular in studying brain‐behavior relationships (Cui & Gong,  ; Finn et al.,  ) and brain alterations in mental disorders (Whelan et al.,  ). The current analysis illustrates that comparing performance with chance level may not be sufficient to control for potential confounding variables. Careful choice of control conditions is critical to make a proper conclusion. When performing machine learning analysis on functional activations or connectivity data, the structural MRI data may be a good choice as a control condition. The structural MRI data are usually available alongside the fMRI data, and do not reflect the functional activity of the brain. Adding structural MRI as a control condition could rule out potential structural variations as a source of individual differences, but could also rule out potential MRI baseline variations as shown in the current analysis. A phantom scan may also be considered if long‐term effects are of interest. \n\nThe current study did not completely rule out the potential seasonal or daylight effects on brain structures and functions. Studies using non‐human animals have provided strong evidence of seasonal and daylight effects on brain structural and functional variation in hippocampal volume (Nissilä et al.,  ; Smulders, Sasson, & DeVoogd,  ; Tramontin & Brenowitz,  ). PET studies of different neural transmitters also provide evidence of seasonal effects (Eisenberg et al.,  ; Kaasinen et al.,  ; Kalbitzer et al.,  ; Mc Mahon et al.,  ; Praschak‐Rieder et al.,  ). Seasonal effects on brain functions may still exist, but are difficult to study by using MRI due to the factors identified in the current analysis. \n\nIn conclusion, by applying machining learning on resting‐state fMRI or structural MRI data, we can predict several environmental parameters, with the highest prediction accuracies to daylight length. However, the predictions were not likely due to the environmental effects on brain functions or structures, but may due to the baseline MRI signals. The data highlight the difficulty to use fMRI/MRI data to study long‐term effects, and call for cautions to control for scanner stability when studying long‐term effects. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"a12873a455768a5bc83264162f3b2f87"},

As an essential component of the upward activation system, the locus coeruleus (LC) plays a crucial role in sleep–wake regulation, its aberrant functional connectivity (FC) is found to be involved in ID. The purpose of this study was to explore the modulation effect of acupuncture on the resting state FC of LC in ID patients. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n60 ID patients were recruited and randomly assigned to real acupuncture (RA) or sham acupuncture (SA) treatment. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected before and after the treatment. With LC as the region of interest, the FC method was adopted to examine acupuncture-related modulation of intrinsic connectivity in ID patients. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hyperarousal Scale (HAS), and actigraphy were used to assess sleep quality and cortical hyperarousal states. Associations between clinical outcomes and FC features were calculated using Pearson’s correlation analysis. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe improvement in sleep quality and hyperarousal in the RA group was greater than that in the SA group. After treatment, the FC between the LC and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) decreased in the RA group. The FC between the LC and left insula and supramarginal gyrus (SMG) was higher in the RA group. The change of LC FC values with the SMG was negatively associated with the change in PSQI scores. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nAcupuncture can modulate FC between the LC and IFG, insular gyrus, and SMG. This may imply the potential mechanism of acupuncture treatment for insomnia. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nInsomnia disorder (ID) is the inability to initiate and maintain sleep despite adequate opportunity for sleep, accompanied by significant daytime dysfunction ( ). With a prevalence rate of 30–35% and an annual incidence rate of 7–15% ( ), ID affects our mental and physical health widely ( ;  ). \n\nAs a kind of complementary therapy, acupuncture is widely recognized as a potentially effective treatment method for ID. It has shown a positive effect on improving sleep quality ( ;  ) and alleviating the symptoms of anxiety and depression brought on by insufficient sleep ( ). While the potential mechanisms remain to be elucidated. \n\nThe hyperarousal theory, which proposes increased activation in specific brain regions in insomniacs, is largely recognized as an explanation for the origin of insomnia ( ). The locus coeruleus (LC), a crucial part of the ascending activation system, is a major norepinephrine (NE) producer and projects a large number of neurons to the spinal cord and cortex ( ). LC-NE neurons remain active while awake, and at a resting state during sleep, especially during the rapid eye movement phase ( ;  ). Therefore, LC was regarded as an important contributor to promoting wakefulness and maintaining sleep. \n\nStudies using fMRI have shown that LC plays an important role in insomnia. The functional connectivity (FC) between the LC and the posterior cingulate, thalamus, and caudate nucleus alters with the awakening state ( ). In insomniacs, the FC of LC increased in areas of the sensory cortex and default mode network (DMN) while decreased in the prefrontal cortex ( ). Acupuncture has been shown to regulate the electrophysiology of LC in rat models of insomnia ( ). We hypothesize that regulating the functional activity of LC may be one of the mechanisms for acupuncture to improve sleep. This study aims to investigate the modulation effect of acupuncture on the FC of the LC in ID. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study design and ethical approval \n  \nThis is a single-center, randomized, sham-controlled trial. The trial was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1800015282,  ) and was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (2018BL-002-02). Prior to the beginning of the trial, each participant was required to sign an informed consent form. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nSixty right-handed subjects who scored a total of 8 or more in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and had a diagnosis of insomnia disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) were recruited for the trial. Those with an unstable medical condition, a diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome, a contraindication for MRI, an addiction to drugs or alcohol, or a history of acupuncture therapy within 1 month were excluded. All eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the real acupuncture (RA) or sham acupuncture (SA) group. \n\nOut of 60 subjects recruited for the study, ten patients dropped out due to COVID-19 or scheduling conflicts. Fifty patients (26 in the RA group and 24 in the SA group) who completed the two fMRI scans were included for data analysis. \n\n\n### Interventions \n  \nPatients in the RA group received acupuncture at Baihui (GV-20), Shenting (GV-24), Benshen (GB13), Sishencong (EX-HN1), bilateral Sanyinjiao (SP-6), bilateral Neiguan (PC-6), and bilateral Shenmen (HT-7). The selection of these acupuncture points was based on our previous clinical study, which found that these points improved sleep quality and daytime function in patients with insomnia ( ). Needles were entered 10 mm horizontally for GV-20, GV-24, GB13, and EX-HN1, 5 mm vertically for HT7 and PC6, and 10 mm vertically for SP6, all while twisting the needle to induce a Deqi sensation, a sensation that includes numbness, soreness, and distension. \n\nIn the SA group, acupoints not related to insomnia treatment were selected, such as Binao (LI-14), Shousanli (LI-10), Yangchi (TE-4), Waiguan (TE-5), Fengshi (GB-31), Liangqiu (ST-34), and Futu (ST-32) (all bilateral). These points are often used to treat local tissue ailments and have little therapeutic effect on insomnia according to literature search. Needles were inserted superficially without manual stimulation. \n\nAll subjects received three 30-min acupuncture sessions per week for 4 weeks. \n\nThe acupoint positions in both groups are depicted in  . \n  \nThe acupoints selected in the trial.

Created with  . \n  \n\n### Randomization and blinding \n  \nRandomization was conducted with a block size of six. Random numbers generated by the SAS statistical analysis system were sealed in opaque envelopes. A research assistant who was not involved in the intervention or assessment of the trial was in charge of the randomization. Owing to the characteristics of acupuncture, acupuncturists were not blinded to the assignments. The non-effective acupoints acupuncture design can however guarantee a good blinding effect for the participants. Assessors and statisticians involved in data collection and analysis were blinded to the assignments. \n\n\n### Assessment scale \n  \nThe PSQI consists of 19 self-assessed and five other-assessed items. It is used to assess the sleep quality of the subjects over the last month. The higher the PSQI score, the worse the sleep quality ( ). The Hyperarousal Scale (HAS) consists of 26 arousal-related items and is used to assess cortical hyperarousal states, with higher scores indicating higher levels of arousal ( ). The PSQI and HAS scales were assessed before and after treatment. \n\n\n### Actigraphy \n  \nParticipants were required to wear an actigraphy (MTI Health Services Company, Pensacola, FL, United States) on their non-dominant wrist to obtain objective data on sleep such as total sleep time (TST), the time of wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (EFFICIENCY). The device was worn for a week before and after treatment. \n\n\n### Imaging acquisition \n  \nMRI scans were performed on a 3.0-Tesla MRI scanner (MAGNETOM, Trio, Siemens, Germany) at the Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. High-resolution whole-brain structural images were recorded using a T1-weighted isotropic multi-echo magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence. Resting-state functional images were obtained by blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences. To correct for the effects of magnetic field inhomogeneity, a field map sequence was scanned before EPI ( ). Further details are provided in  . During scanning, subjects were required to stay awake and avoid thinking about anything. \n\n\n### Image processing and analysis of fMRI data \n  \nImage pre-processing and FC analysis were conducted by Data Processing & Analysis of Brain Imaging (DPABI,  ) ( ), a toolbox in MATLAB 2021b (The MathWorks, Inc.). After removing the first 10 image points of each participant to eliminate the effect of uneven magnetic fields at the beginning or participant discomfort with the scan, the main steps of pre-processing included: slice-timing, realignment, normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate space with 3 × 3 × 3 mm , smooth with a 6 × 6 × 6 mm  full-width at half maximum Gaussian kernel, linear detrending; band-pass filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz), and nuisance signals were regressed out, including the Friston 24 head motion parameters ( ), global signal, white matter signal, and cerebrospinal fluid signal. \n\nAfter pre-processing, the LC, derived from automated anatomical labeling 3 (AAL3) ( ) was selected as the region of interest (ROI) for FC analysis. First-level correlation maps were produced by extracting the BOLD time course from the ROI and computing Pearson’s correlation coefficients between that time course and the time courses of all other voxels in the brain. Then correlation coefficients were Fisher transformed into z scores to increase normality. \n\nWhole-brain second-level group analysis was applied using paired t-tests for within-group comparisons before and after treatment and sample t-tests for between-group comparisons. Age, gender, and head movement parameters were included as covariates of non-interest. A Gaussian random field (GRF) correction at a threshold of   p  -voxel < 0.001 and   p  -cluster < 0.05 was applied. Brain regions with differences were visualized with the BrainNet Viewer  ( ). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe trial data were analyzed according to the per-protocol principle, and patients who completed the two fMRI scans were included in the data analysis. Normality was assessed by the Shapiro–Wilk test. Categorical variables are represented as counts and percentages, and continuous variables as means with standard deviations (SD) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). Differences in continuous variables were compared with the use of a Student’s   t  -test or Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical outcomes were compared with the use of a chi-square test. A two-sided   p   value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Pearson’s correlation analysis was used to investigate correlations between clinical outcome changes (post- minus pre-) and the ΔFC z-score (post- minus pre-). The Bonferroni method was used for multiple comparison correction,   p   < 0.01 (0.05/5) was considered to be statistically significant. Analyses were performed with the use of SPSS software, version26.0 (International Business Machines Corporation). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nDetailed baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in  .

After Bonferroni correction, only the correlation between ΔPSQI and ΔFC value of the LC-left SMG in all subjects was statistically significant (  p   < 0.01) ( ). No correlation was found between ΔFC and clinical outcome changes (all   p   > 0.01) ( ). \n  \nAnalysis of the correlation between the FC changes and PSQI improvement in all subjects. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study aims to explore the effect of acupuncture on the FC of LC in ID patients. The clinical data suggested that acupuncture could modulate the state of arousal and improve sleep quality in insomniacs. Sleep quality was improved in both groups, but more significantly in the RA group. The doctor-patient interaction during acupuncture treatment may relieve the patients’ negative emotions in both groups ( ). The fMRI analysis revealed that the FC between the LC and the IFG, insular, and SMG were modulated following acupuncture treatment. \n\nThe IFG is considered a key brain region for sleep. Individuals with lower gray matter density in the left IFG are more likely to develop insomnia and wake early ( ). Studies have shown that the activity of the IFG decreases during sleep while increases during sleep deprivation ( ). Li et al. discovered that the amplitude of the low-frequency fluctuation value of the left IFG was reduced in insomnia patients and negatively correlated with the duration of insomnia ( ). Yan et al. discovered that the degree centrality value of the left IFG decreased proportionally to the PSQI score in insomniacs ( ). The IFG is a fundamental component of the cognitive control network (CCN), which is involved in executive function and cognitive control ( ). In a previous study, we discovered that patients with insomnia had higher LC FC in the middle frontal gyrus than healthy people ( ). Both the middle frontal gyrus and IFG belong to CNN, demonstrating the importance of CNN in sleep regulation. Abnormal CCN function was found in ID patients, which may account for the heightened sensitivity to external stimulation ( ). Our study found that the FC between the LC and IFG was downregulated after acupuncture, which is consistent with the previous findings; thus, acupuncture may inhibit the overactivation of the IFG. \n\nThe insula is part of the salience network (SN) and is crucial for decision-making, cognition, emotion regulation, and attention control ( ). Patients with ID exhibited abnormal insular activity during both task execution and resting states. ID patients showed decreased FC between the insula, amygdala, striatum, and thalamus compared to normal sleepers ( ;  ). The co-activation of the insula with the SN is increased when ID patients fall asleep ( ). Prior studies found that the FC value between the bilateral insula in ID patients decreased ( ;  ). The anatomical connection between the LC and insula is related to the processing of unexpected events ( ;  ), and the changes in the FC of the LC-insula may be associated with the modulation of perceptual awareness skills and salience event processing ( ). Our study found the consistent results, real acupuncture could increase the FC of the LC-left insular. But we were unable to establish a significant correlation between this finding and clinical assessments, which may be related to the sample size. Based on the above studies, we speculated that acupuncture may be beneficial for interoceptive and emotional processing in ID by modulating the abnormal functional of the insula. \n\nThe ΔFC value of SMG showed differences between groups. And ΔPSQI was negatively associated with the ΔFC value of LC-left SMG. The SMG belongs to the inferior parietal lobule, which is part of the DMN ( ) and plays an important role in the adjustment of consciousness ( ). Kay et al. discovered an inverse correlation between the rate of glucose metabolism in SMG and sleep efficiency ( ). A voxel-based morphometry study showed that the white matter volume of SMG was negatively associated with the PSQI score ( ), and the higher volume of SMG was correlated with the longer sleep duration ( ). Studies found that the increasement in parietal lobe activity could compensate for the decreased cognition caused by insomnia ( ;  ). Based on these findings, we believe that acupuncture may relieve cognitive decline caused by insomnia by modulating LC-SMG FC. \n\nAn earlier study found decreased LC-IFG FC and elevated LC-SMG FC in ID patients ( ), which appears inconsistent with our findings. This difference may be related to the compensatory mechanism described above and, on the other hand, to the variation in depression and anxiety in the included population. Anxiety and depression were found to affect the FC of IFG and brain regions in DMN ( ;  ;  ). Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether insomnia or anxiety and depression had a greater impact on the FC of LC-IFG and LC-SMG in that study. The FC of LC is also influenced by age, differences in demographic characteristics can also contribute to inconsistent results ( ;  ). In addition, the difference in the method of LC localization may also play roles. There are relatively few studies on the FC of LC in insomnia patients, and the results lack uniformity ( ;  ). To obtain more accurate results, a big-scale study focused on ID patients without emotional problems is needed. As for the brain regions that showed differences in the between-group comparisons but did not appear in the within-group comparisons (insula and SMG), it may be related to the non-specific effect of the sham acupuncture, which needs to be further explored. Furthermore, we discovered that the brain regions with FC differences are in the left hemisphere, which is intriguing. We suspect this is because the insomnia patients we recruited were all right-handed. Activation in the left hemisphere of the brain was found to be more dominant than the right in right-handed people ( ). We will include left-handed patients in our future study to test our hypothesis. \n\nAcupuncture has been found to regulate heart rate variability, indicating that acupuncture can inhibit the sympathetic nerve and activate the vagus nerve ( ;  ). Acupuncture’s regulation mechanism on the LC FC may be related to afferent vagus nerve stimulation. The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is primarily innervated by vagal afferents, and the NTS projects to the locus coeruleus. The peripheral vagus nerve can be stimulated to further regulate the functional activities of the LC. Future research should be combined with heart rate variability and other indicators to evaluate vagal nerve activity in order to validate this hypothesis. \n\nThere are some limitations in our research. First of all, the LC is the main source of NE, but this study did not involve the measurement of NE, and future studies should be combined with relevant examinations. Second, actigraphy relies on exercise to identify the awake period, although it is relatively objective but not accurate enough, polysomnography should be adopted. Thirdly, the LC has only 45,000–50,000 cells, making its precise location difficult. Even though the LC region has been added to AAL3, a more precise map of the Chinese brain is required. Additionally, the sample size was relatively small in this study. Additional studies should be conducted with larger sample sizes to confirm our findings. Lastly, there was no follow-up in this study, in the future, a long-term observation is required. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the mechanism of acupuncture treatment of insomnia utilizing the FC of LC. We found that the behavioural results of the insomniacs improved after acupuncture, and the imaging results showed that the FC between the LC and IFG, insular and SMG were modulated. The LC, which connects the SN, CCN, and DMN, may be an important target for acupuncture to improve insomnia. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Medical Ethical Committee of the Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

The patient cohort included 21patients with asymptomatic spinal cord compression, 48 mild DCM patients, and 20 moderate or severe DCM patients. Functional connectivity networks were quantified for all participants, and the transition matrices were quantified to determine the differences in network connectivity through increasingly myelopathic stages of DCM. Additionally, a link prediction model was used to determine whether more severe stages of DCM can be predicted from less symptomatic stages using the transition matrices. \n\n\n## Findings \n  \nResults indicated interruptions in most connections within the sensorimotor network in conjunction with spinal cord compression, while compensatory connectivity was observed within and between primary and secondary sensorimotor regions, subcortical regions, visuospatial regions including the cuneus, as well as the brainstem and cerebellum. A link prediction model achieved an excellent predictive performance in estimating connectivity of more severe myelopathic stages of DCM, with the highest area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.927 for predicting mild DCM from patients with asymptomatic spinal cord compression. \n\n\n## Interpretation \n  \nA series of predictable changes in functional connectivity occur throughout the stages of DCM pathogenesis.

Advanced imaging modalities have helped elucidate cerebral alterations associated with neurological impairment caused by DCM, with increasing evidence suggests that neural plasticity through brain reorganization acts to preserve function in DCM patients. \n\nWe searched PubMed from January 2014, to December 2021, for relevant articles in English relating to brain functional connectivity associated with progressive myelopathy in DCM patients. Search terms included: “progressive degenerative cervical myelopathy”, “asymptomatic cervical spondylosis myelopathy”, “fMRI”, “brain functional network”, “brain functional connectivity”, “graph theory”, “link prediction”, “severity of degenerative cervical myelopathy prediction”. Previous studies have reported altered functional connectivity with within sensorimotor regions as a response to DCM, but no study has analyzed the brain functional network in asymptomatic DCM patients. We have also found that majority of studies associated functional connectivity changes with symptom severity evaluated by mJOA score, but no study has characterized the cortical pattern of functional brain network at different stages of myelopathy severity, ranging from asymptomatic spinal cord compression (mJOA=18) myelopathy to moderate/severe myelopathy (mJOA≤14), and it remains unknown if patterns in network connectivity be used to predict transition to more myelopathic stages of DCM. Additionally, some studies have suggested that the brain helps to compensate for functional deficits during progressive stages of DCM, but the importance of cerebellum and brainstem has been understudied. \n\n\n## Added value of this study \n  \nThis study examined and characterized the cerebral patterns of the functional connectivity network for each stage of DCM symptom severity, as well as healthy controls and those with asymptomatic spinal cord compression. Results demonstrate that a series of predictable changes in functional connectivity occur as DCM patients transition from asymptomatic spinal cord compression through moderate/severe myelopathy. Interestingly, the brainstem and cerebellum appear highly influential in optimizing sensorimotor function during worsening myelopathy. The study also established a link prediction model based on a graph embedding method and a light GBM algorithm to estimate strengthening and/or weakening functional connectivity during transition from one stage of DCM severity to the next. The ROC AUC for transitions between symptomatic DCM stages ranged from 0.884 to 0.927, with the highest AUC for predicting mild from asymptomatic DCM. \n\n\n## Implications of all of the available evidence \n  \nThis is the first cross-sectional observational study to characterize brain functional networks in DCM patients with varying degrees of myelopathy severity; and use the functional connectivity within the functional brain network exhibited during a particular myelopathy stage of DCM to estimate the network present in the next stage with higher symptom severity. The study has also evidenced a widespread cerebral network differences between the healthy and the asymptomatic stage, which may serve as an important predictive biomarker for monitoring DCM. Neurological function appears preserved through large-scale cerebral plasticity in cases of increased severity of myelopathy, and compensatory input from subcortical regions undergoes adaptations in response to increasing neurological deterioration. The proposed link predication model can inclusively estimate brain changes associated with myelopathy severity by both adding and removing connections within the functional network. Network features extracted via graph embedding method can contribute to future automated modeling by using a graph convolution network in simulating results of other image modalities, classifying myelopathy severity, predicting surgical outcomes, and monitoring disease progression. \n\n \n\n## Introduction \n  \nDegenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of spinal cord impairment in patients over the age of 55, often with profound negative effects on their quality of life.  Progressive degeneration of the cervical spinal canal can lead to spinal cord compression and ultimately degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), manifesting as gait disturbance, limb dyscoordination, and sensory abnormalities. Damage to cervical neurons travelling both to and from the brain affects upstream cerebral structural and functional networks. \n\nIncreasing evidence suggests neural plasticity through brain reorganization acts to preserve function in DCM patients. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   Using functional MRI, studies have showed widespread adaptive changes in bilateral primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor area, cingulate motor area, parietal cortex, and contralateral primary somatosensory cortex in cases of spinal cord injury and cervical compressive myelopathy due to spondylosis.  Additionally, increased functional connectivity within sensorimotor networks, as well as decreased functional connectivity between subcortical regions and frontal lobe executive regions were found to be associated with worsened neurological impairment in DCM.  However, most of these studies capture specific regional differences, but do not examine the global patterns in brain function with the goal of predicting severity of myelopathy. Thus, novel methods are needed to analyze and understand the entire brain functional network, which may be useful for predicting disease progression, understanding which brain regions are involved in adaptation and compensation, and predicting post-surgical outcomes. \n\nA promising approach for modeling whole brain connectivity changes is the “  link prediction model  ”, in which alterations in “links” within the network are predicted based on features intrinsic to the network itself.  This technique has previously been applied to social and biological networks, and more recently to brain network alterations in Alzheimer's disease.  We theorize that a link prediction model may be of significant value for describing brain connectivity in patients with DCM, as we hypothesize brain networks are continuously evolving as myelopathic symptoms intensify. Therefore, the current study characterized brain functional networks in healthy controls, asymptomatic patients with spinal cord compression, and DCM patients with varying degrees of myelopathy severity. We then used a link prediction model to quantify whole brain connectivity at different stages of myelopathy severity, as defined by their modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score. We hypothesized sensorimotor regions would drive widespread network changes in the brain associated with worsening myelopathic severity. We also theorized that subcortical regions would be the first to exhibit functional reorganization associated with neurological deterioration, presumably to preserve sensorimotor function. Lastly, we postulated that functional connectivity within the functional brain network exhibited during a particular symptomatic stage of DCM could be estimated from the network present in the preceding stage with lower symptom severity using a link prediction model. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Patient population \n  \nA total of 116 participants, including 78 DCM patients, 21 patients with asymptomatic spinal cord compression (SCC), and 17 healthy controls, were prospectively enrolled from 2016 to 2021 in a cross-sectional study involving observational MRI and evaluation of neurological dysfunction. DCM patients were recruited from an outpatient neurosurgery clinic, and each had spinal cord compression with evidence of spinal cord deformation and no visible cerebrospinal fluid signal around the spinal cord at the site of maximal compression on MRI. The mJOA score was used as a measure of neurological function,  where lower value of mJOA represents a worse neurological impairment. \n\n\n### Ethics \n  \nThis study was approved by the UCLA Office of the Human Research Protection Program, IRB # 11-001876. All patients signed Institutional Review Board-approved consent forms, and all analyses were performed in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). \n\n\n### MR imaging acquisition \n  \nTo evaluate functional connectivity and construct the functional network networks, resting-state functional MR images (rs-fMRI) were acquired using a Siemens Prisma 3T MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with repetition time (TR)=2000 ms; echo time (TE)=28 ms; slice thickness of 4 mm with no interslice gap; field of view (FOV)=220 mm with an acquisition matrix of 64 × 64 for an in-plane resolution of 3.4 mm, and flip angle of 77°. Additionally, a 1 mm 3D isotropic MPRAGE sequence was acquired for alignment with functional MRI data using standard acquisition parameters (TR=2300–2500 ms, a minimum TE, inversion time (TI)=900–945 ms, flip angle 9–15°, FOV=240 × 320 mm and matrix size of 240 × 320, slice thickness=1 mm). \n\n\n### Image preprocessing \n  \nAll functional MR images were pre-processed using the default built-in pre-processing pipeline within the CONN Toolbox ( ),  which implements functions from the Statistic Parametric Mapping (SPM,  ) toolbox (see detailed pre-processing steps in appendix p 1);. \n\n\n### Individual functional connectivity network construction \n  \nTwo region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI functional connectivity networks (FCNs) were constructed for each individual participant. The brain atlas for both FCNs is based on the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (MNI) coordinate system: 1) whole brain FCN with all the brain regions selected, including 86 cortical regions and 19 subcortical regions. For subcortical regions, we further divided the cerebellum into 26 sub-regions and the brainstem into 6 sub-regions according to Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL).  2) DCM representative brain FCN with regions seeded from anatomical regions that are known to often be explicitly associated with DCM, ,  ,  ,   as well as from regions that have been demonstrated in previous studies to undergo cortical morphological changes as a result of DCM (appendix p 3). \n\n\n### Functional connectivity network associated with varying degrees of myelopathy severity \n  \nCharacterizing the FCNs associated with varying degrees of myelopathy severity requires matrices containing information of FCs strengthening and/or weakening during transition from one stage of DCM severity to the next. As illustrated in  , after verifying that the FC distribution of each stage was approximately normal, matrices containing the transition information were computed by performing unpaired t-tests (with age included as a covariate) between FCNs at each stage, defined as the   healthy control stage, asymptomatic SCC stage, mild DCM stage   and the   moderate/severe DCM stage  . When results failed to show statistical significance (  p   > 0.05), this was interpreted no change in connectivity between the two stages. For statistical differences in FCs between two stages, the mean FC was calculated for the two diagnostic stages. Using the   healthy control stage   and the   asymptomatic SCC stage   as an example ( ), if the   healthy control stage   had a higher mean FC than the   asymptomatic SCC stage  , the link in FC was interpreted as weakening as the   healthy control stage   transitions to the   asymptomatic SCC stage.   In contrast, if the   healthy control stage   had a lower mean FC compared with the   asymptomatic SCC stage  , the link in FC was interpreted as strengthening as the   healthy control stage   transitions to the   asymptomatic SCC stage  .   \nImage processing pipeline for functional network analyses and the link prediction model. fMRI images were preprocessed through CONN and correlation coefficients among different regions were extracted from symmetric adjacency matrices to construct brain functional networks. Transitional matrices representing disease progression between different myelopathy stages matrices were calculated, which were further used in the topological analyses and link prediction. Significance was set at   p   < 0·05. \n  Figure 1   \n\nFollowing the calculation of link matrices representing differences between myelopathy stages, the matrix representing each DCM stage was initialized. To do this, the average connectivity matrix across subjects was calculated for each sequential stage, then converted elements larger than 0.25 were set to “1” and elements equal to or smaller than 0.25 were set to “0”.  To take the stage transition information into consideration, we subtracted the matrices that represent differences between DCM stages from the matrix representing each DCM stage. This subtraction was propagated and enacted for 1000 iterations until reaching a steady state solution. \n\n\n### Representative brain functional connectivity network analysis \n  \nThe Graph Theory GLM (GTG) Matlab Toolbox ( ) and in-house Matlab workflow scripts were used to calculate and analyze the properties of representative brain FCN. Specifically, two indices of centrality metrics were compute: 1) Degree centrality, reflecting the number of neighbors a brain region interacts with (see detailed information and mathematical formula in appendix p 1); 2) Betweenness centrality, reflecting the ability of a region to influence information flow between two other regions (see detailed information and mathematical formula in appendix p 1). Regions with both high degree and betweenness centrality are considered as   brain hubs  , which are highly influential within a network, communicate with many other regions, and facilitate functional integration. \n\n\n### Link prediction model using whole brain functional connectivity network \n  \nGraph embedding method was implemented to build the link prediction model.  Compared to topological properties characterized by graph theory, which only carry features of node related information, but also captures information about the surrounding nodes by representing every node within FCN as a fixed-length vector. To achieve this, algorithmic framework   node2vec   was used to learn and extract continuous features of each node in the whole brain FCN representing different DCM stages of severity (appendix p 2), then those features were fed into the light gradient boosting machine (light GBM) algorithm for further classification of connectivity as strengthening, weakening, or unchanging. Light GBM is an ensemble algorithm, which uses a special type of decision trees, also called weak learners, to capture complex, non-linear patterns. To prevent model from overfitting, early stopping is enabled for light GBM if the predictions haven't improved for the last 50 rounds (appendix p 2). The AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) was used to evaluate the model performance, where higher AUC indicates better performance of the link prediction model in classifying FCs associated with sequential DCM stages. \n\n\n### Role of funders \n  \nThe funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analyses, interpretation, or writing of report. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe patient cohort consisted of 61 men and 38 women, ranging in age from 31 to 82 with an average age of 59. Twenty-one asymptomatic SCC patients (mJOA=18) were included in the cohort, 8 of whom had upper motor neuron signs elicited on physical examination. Hyperreflexia and a positive Hoffman's sign were each encountered in 5 of these patients. Two of the asymptomatic SCC compression patients had both hyperreflexia and a positive Hoffman's sign. The remainder of the study cohort consisted of 48 DCM patients with mild myelopathy (mJOA 15–17), and 20 DCM patients with moderate or severe myelopathy (mJOA ≤ 14). Additionally, a cohort of 17 healthy control volunteers (nine men and 8 women), ranging in age from 25 to 62 and with an average age of 41, underwent the same MRI protocol. The patient and healthy control volunteer demographics are summarized in  .   \nDemographics of study participants. \n  Table 1     \n\n### Characterizing representative brain FCN of different myelopathy stage \n  \nIn healthy control volunteers (appendix p 4), 23 brain regions were identified as brain hubs, which corresponded to anatomic locations known to be important role in maintaining sensorimotor function. In the transition from healthy control to asymptomatic SCC ( a-b), 89 connections between the cerebellum and the brainstem as well as thalamus were strengthened, while 58 connections between the frontal lobe and the thalamus and supplementary regions were weakened. These changes in connectivity were driven by alterations in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG r), the left precentral gyrus (PreCG l), bilateral thalamus, the left putamen, the left SMA, regions responsible for visual input and spatial navigation, and several subregions of cerebellum and brainstem.   \nPatterns of functional connectivity (FC) during transition from (  a  ) healthy control, (  b  ) asymptomatic SCC (mJOA = 18), (  c  ) mild DCM (15 ≤ mJOA ≤ 17), (d) to moderate/severe DCM (mJOA ≤ 14). Patterns were characterized using representative brain FCN with regions seeded from anatomical regions that are known to often be explicitly associated with DCM, as well as from regions that have been demonstrated in previous studies to undergo cortical morphological changes as a result of DCM. Top row of images denotes anatomic regions with high betweenness and degree centrality. Middle row denotes the transitional matrix associated with worsened severity, with red connections indicating strengthening connectivity and blue connections indicating weakening connectivity. Bottom row illustrates the anatomy of these changes in connectivity as DCM evolves and becomes more symptomatic. \n  Figure 2   \n\nWhen examining asymptomatic SCC patients (appendix p 5), 20 brain regions were identified as brain hubs within the functional network, corresponding to bilateral PreCG and the anterior cingulate (AC), as well as subregions located in cerebellum. During transition from asymptomatic SCC to DCM with mild myelopathy ( B-C), the connectivity corresponding to 85 connections with the cerebellum were strengthened, while connectivity in 94 connections between the cerebellum and the AC, right PreCG, bilateral SFG and SMA were weakened. These changes were driven by alterations in the centrality of the AC, the right PreCG, bilateral SFG and SMA, as well multiple subregions of cerebellum. \n\nFor both mild (appendix p 6) and moderate-to-severe DCM (appendix p 7), only 12 and 10 brain regions were identified as brain hubs, respectively. Additionally, for symptomatic patients with at least mild DCM, no cortical regions were identified as brain hubs, but several subregions of cerebellum and brainstem still maintained their influential role within network. In the transition from the mild myelopathy to moderate-to-severe DCM ( c-d), the connectivity for 52 connections between cerebellar vermis and brainstem to the left SFG, the left PreCG and thalamus strengthened, while 64 connections   within   the cerebellum weakened. \n\n\n### Link prediction model using whole brain FCN \n  \nLastly, the graph embedding method was used to extract features from the matrices representing different stages of DCM symptom severity, and then the light GBM algorithm was applied to classify strengthening and weakening connectivity. Using this approach, the ROC AUC for transitions between symptomatic DCM stages ranged from 0.884 to 0.927, with the highest AUC for predicting mild from asymptomatic SCC (  and  ).   \nSummary of link prediction performance in classifying FC patterns associated with different stages of DCM symptom severity. \n  Table 2       \nReceiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the link prediction model using light GBM algorithm for overall prediction (gray line with square marker), predicting connectivity patterns in asymptomatic SCC from healthy control connectivity (black line with asterisk marker), predicting connectivity patterns for mild DCM from asymptomatic SCC (black line), and predicting connectivity patterns for moderate/severe DCM from mild DCM (gray line). \n  Figure 3   \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the past decade, upstream morphological abnormalities,  and functional connectivity within sensorimotor regions as a response to spinal cord injury have been widely studied. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   Consistent with these previous findings, we were able to confirm that large-scale functional network reorganization occurs in patients with DCM by characterizing the connectivity patterns associated with varying degrees of functional impairment in patients with DCM. These findings are consistent with previous reports demonstrating degenerative motor and sensory function,  widespread cortical atrophy,  and abnormal cerebral network connectivity in patients with DCM,  dependent on symptom severity. \n\nResults suggest that during asymptomatic SCC, when the spinal cord is compressed but the patient is not experiencing the typical symptoms of upper motor neuron damage caused by spinal cord compression,  connections between the thalamus and sensorimotor network are interrupted, while new connections are strengthened between brainstem, subcortical regions, visuospatial areas, and regions within the cerebellum. The strengthening of connectivity observed between the cuneus and precentral gyrus suggests visual input may be used in assisting postural control and preserving motor function during initial stages of cord compression, while the strengthened connectivity between cerebellum and thalamus may indicate greater input from the cerebellothalamic tract, a fiber pathway responsible for motor adaptation and transmitting information for the sensory system.  Additionally, the right SFG, the left PreCG, the left putamen, the left SMA and bilateral thalamus were identified as altered hub regions, suggesting asymptomatic spinal cord compression may in fact be resulting in chronic damage to sensorimotor neurons. \n\nAs asymptomatic SCC transitions to mild DCM, a decrease in connectivity was observed between the cerebellum, brainstem, SMA and primary motor cortex, as well as the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate, thalamus, and cuneus. Together, this suggests possible white matter impairment to the bilateral corticospinal tracts extending through the corona radiata associated with the neurological deterioration.  While connectivity between these regions decreased dramatically, connectivity   within   the cerebellum and between the brainstem and cerebellum appeared to strengthen. This was particularly the case between the cerebellar vermis, and subregions including the cerebellar second motor representation (lobule VIII) and cerebellar third non-motor representations (lobule X). The spinocerebellular tract, part of the cerebellar vermis, acts to receive somatosensory input from ascending spinal pathways, as well as associated bodily posture and locomotion information.  The cerebellar second motor representation (lobule VIII) tends to be engaged in motor processes that require high attention, but less involved in pure motor information processing. Additionally, evidence suggests the cerebellar second motor representation might share functional similarities with the cerebellar third nonmotor representation.  Together, this suggests increased cerebellar connectivity may serve in a compensatory capacity to preserve sensorimotor function in response to initial stages of neurological deterioration in DCM. \n\nAs mild DCM evolves to moderate/severe DCM, connectivity directly between the cerebellum and thalamus, sensorimotor areas, and frontal lobe strengthened sharply, and connectivity with the brainstem and within the cerebellum itself weakened. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that neurological function is preserved through large-scale cerebral plasticity in cases of increased severity of myelopathy, and that compensatory input from subcortical regions undergo adaptations in response to neurological deterioration. Previous studies have proposed that upper motor cortex neurons influence the spinal cord circuits by two routes: direct projections to the spinal cord via the corticospinal pathway, and indirect projections to brainstem centers via the corticoreticulospinal pathway.  It is possible that during worsening myelopathy, patients may exhaust their localized functional compensatory mechanisms via the cerebellum, then subsequent adaptations are recruited to optimize residual neurological function and sustain motor behavior performance. This hypothesis is further supported by the observed reduction in the number of cortical regions identified as brain hubs during the more severe myelopathic stages of DCM, while several subregions of cerebellum and brainstem still maintained their influential role within these networks. Importantly, DCM patients with moderate/severe myelopathy have a greater number and severity of symptoms,  and surgical guidelines have strongly recommended surgery for this cohort, whereas mild DCM can be treated nonoperatively.  Therefore, understanding the transition between mild and moderate/severe DCM has direct clinical implications. \n\nGraph analyses and corresponding algorithms have been widely used to understand the structure of functional brain networks by predicting future relationships and missing connections.  One group has also utilized the link prediction model to estimate brain network changes in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.  Rather than computing the node neighborhood similarity score using popular algorithms such as Common Neighbors (CN) and Preferential Attachments (PA) for direct use of graph vector features for each node,  the current study implemented graph embedding and extracted vector features of each node.  Graph embedding learns low-dimensional representations for nodes in a graph, which is able to capture information about the surrounding nodes other than the node itself. These features can also benefit future automated modeling via a graph convolution network  to classify myelopathy severity, predict surgical outcomes, and monitor disease progression. Results out of the link prediction model highlighted the transition from asymptomatic SCC to mild DCM as having the strongest classification performance, whereas the transition from mild to moderate/severe DCM was the least predictive. This may be the case because previous studies have suggested link prediction models work best when the functional network has fewer changes at each stage,  implying the transition from asymptomatic SCC to mild DCM may be subtle. This is consistent with previous studies showing that patients with significant spinal cord compression do not always have corresponding symptoms, in part due to supraspinal compensatory mechanisms. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nIt is important to note that the performance of the link prediction model is highly dependent on sample size. Future study with a larger group of severe DCM patients will allow for better stratification of the moderate/severe group, although this is partially mitigated as these patients are treated similarly from a clinical perspective. Future investigation utilizing comparisons between the mJOA subscores and the brain functional connectivity network could provide additional insights into the neural plasticity associated with DCM. Although the statistical analysis of connectivity differences between patients and the healthy control volunteer cohort accounted for the variation in age of each patient, inclusion of additional older healthy control volunteers would be useful in improving the performance of the predictive model. Furthermore, the matrix representing each DCM stage was calculated by binarizing functional connectivity correlation matrix. Although the current study iterated 1000 times over matrices representing differences between DCM stages until reaching a steady state solution, a more comprehensive algorithm that includes the weight of ROI-to-ROI connections would likely benefit the characterization of network representing each DCM state, thus the outcomes of the link prediction model. Finally, continuous collection of longitudinal imaging that tracks disease progression of individual patients is necessary to validate the current cross sectional model. This could also provide more information about impact of symptom duration on supraspinal reorganization. In addition, there is a small subset of DCM patients that improve neurologically with nonoperative treatment, and a longitudinal study design would allow for further investigation into this group. Lastly, we theorize a combination of structural and functional connectivity patterns could be employed to further understand how the brain compensates for neurological impairment during progressive DCM. \n\nTo summarize, a series of well defined, predictable changes in brain functional connectivity occur during DCM pathogenesis. Additionally, the proposed link prediction model may be beneficial in future studies for monitoring disease progression and/or predicting treatment response in patients with DCM. \n\n\n\n## Contributors \n  \nAll authors had full access to the final dataset and approved the final submitted version of this report.

ED-specific neuropsychological and brain characteristics have been identified, but often in individuals in the acute phase or recovered from EDs, precluding an understanding of whether they are correlates and scars of EDs vs. predisposing factors. Although familial high-risk (FHR) studies are available across other disorders, this study design has not been used in EDs. We carried out the first FMH study in EDs, investigating healthy offspring of women with EDs and controls. We preliminarily aimed to investigate ED-related neurocognitive and brain markers that could point to predisposing factors for ED. Sixteen girls at FHR for EDs and twenty control girls (age range: 8–15), completed neuropsychological tests assessing executive functions. Girls also underwent a resting-state fMRI scan to quantify functional connectivity (FC) within resting-state networks. Girls at FHR for EDs performed worse on a cognitive flexibility task compared with controls (F = 5.53,   p   = 0.02). Moreover, they showed different FC compared with controls in several resting-state networks (  p   < 0.05 FDR-corrected). Differences identified in cognitive flexibility and in FC are in line with those identified in individuals with EDs, strongly pointing to a role as potential endophenotypes of EDs. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nEating disorders (EDs) such as anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) are severe psychiatric disorders and have important consequences on physical health and psychosocial functioning [ ]. EDs affect 10–20% of adolescents and young adults [ , ]. \n\nResearch shows that individuals with EDs differ in terms of cognitive processing and brain structure and function compared with controls [ , , ]. Although specific correlates have been identified in each diagnostic group, main neurocognitive alterations have been found across executive functions [ ]. One of the most studied cognitive components in EDs, particularly in AN, is set-shifting. Difficulties in set-shifting (or cognitive flexibility, which refers to the ability to shift thoughts or actions according to situations) have obtained evidence as a correlate of EDs (although most of the literature focuses on AN) [ , , , , ]. In addition, differences in other high-demand cognitive functions including working memory and sustained attention have been highlighted in relation to EDs [ ]. \n\nFrom a functional perspective, several neuroimaging studies with ED patients have shown abnormal patterns of brain functional connectivity (FC) at rest that parallel these findings. Evidence highlights ED-specific abnormal FC during resting state within the default-mode (DMN) network. As its name suggests, the DMN consists of a set of areas that are active while not performing any particular task, i.e., in the complete state of rest [ , , ]. This circuit is a large-scale network that includes regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and angular gyrus. It is involved in different cognitive functions, such as self-reflection, mind-wandering, self-referential mechanisms, autobiographical memory, self-evaluation processes [ , , ], and it has frequently been seen to be involved in EDs [ , ]. However, other resting-state networks also seem to be affected by EDs, such as central executive (CEN) [ , ], ventral visual (VN), and sensorimotor (SMN) networks [ , ], the lateral visual and auditory networks [ ] and the salience network [ , ]. These FC abnormalities mostly mirror cognitive and behavioral characteristics identified in EDs [ , ]. \n\nAlthough these findings are extremely useful in paving the way for an understanding of the neurobiology of EDs, they cannot help us disentangle whether characteristics identified are correlates/scars or endophenotypes (i.e., neurobehavioral traits that index genetic susceptibility for a psychiatric disorder [ ] of EDs. Most studies, in fact, have focused on ED patients in an acute phase, or recovered from illness; hence, parsing out whether these alterations are secondary to active ED symptoms (e.g., starvation) or a scar of disorder is very difficult. \n\nEDs show a strong genetic component [ ]; they run in families, and studies have revealed this familial aggregation is likely to be due to genetic factors [ ]. Familial high-risk (FHR) studies focus on individuals who have a biological relative, most commonly a parent, with a severe mental illness and who are at higher risk for the development of the disease. They rely on investigating subjects prior to the onset of the disorder and allow a prospective study of emerging psychopathology. This type of design allows identification of behavioral and biological predisposing factors, or traits of a mental disorder, without the confounding role of acute illness. The FHR design has been used across several psychiatric conditions [ ], such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, to identify biological markers of mental illness. Studying individuals at FHR for EDs may reveal new information on predisposing neurobiological traits or endophenotypes for EDs. To date, only our previous cohort studies [ , ] have investigated cognition and neuropsychology in offspring of women with EDs, but an FHR study including both neuropsychology and neuroimaging has not been yet carried out. Therefore, capitalizing on the strength of the FHR design, we aimed to conduct a preliminary investigation of cognitive and neural markers in offspring of mothers with EDs compared with children born to women with no psychiatric disorders (control group). We focused our study on female offspring, given that ED prevalence is much higher in women than men [ ]; thus, females are at higher risk of EDs. We aimed to test the hypothesis that children at FHR for EDs show behavioral neurocognitive differences compared with controls in line with those typical of EDs (specifically related to set shifting and related high-demanding cognitive components such as working memory and attention); and hypothesized that resting-state FC would mirror these differences. These characteristics, if present in those at FHR for EDs, may be serious candidates as ED endophenotypes. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nAll participants were recruited in the United Kingdom from ED clinics, ED support groups, and online adverts. In total, 36 girls and their mothers were recruited. The group at FHR included healthy daughters (N = 16, age-range:8–15 years, mean age:12.00 ± 2.19) of mothers with a history of current or past EDs (14 AN and 2 BN), while the control sample included healthy daughters (N = 20, age-range:8–15 years, mean age = 12.25 ± 1.94) of mothers with no history of EDs or any other psychiatric disorders ( ). Two participants from the control group dropped out before the MRI examination, reducing the control group sample to eighteen participants. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethical Committee of UCL and National Health Service. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. Both mothers and children were fully informed of the study, and both were required to give consent. Separate information sheets tailored to the child’s age (8 to 10 and 11 to 15 years old) were provided. Parents were able to decline participation on behalf of the child. \n\n\n### 2.2. Experimental Procedures \n  \nWe used the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I DSM-IV Disorders (SCID-I) [ ] to determine diagnoses of EDs. This tool is a valuable semi-structured diagnostic interview used to establish Axis I DSM-5 disorders [ ]. Its ED module includes some open-ended questions on the presence of ED symptoms and cognitions. Relevant questions were repeated at appropriate times to determine the lifetime presence of ED symptoms. \n\nPsychopathology (including ED symptoms) was assessed in offspring (FHR and HC) using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) [ ] and the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA) [ ]. An MRI safety questionnaire was filled out before scanning to check for suitability for MRI examination. All experimental measures and demographic data were collected at Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL. \n\n\n### 2.3. Measures \n  \n#### 2.3.1. Socio Demographic Data \n  \nMaternal age, relationship status (married or cohabitating vs. not), education (up to O level/GCSE equivalent vs. A level and above) and ethnicity (White vs. non-White) were collected using an ad hoc questionnaire. \n\n\n#### 2.3.2. Anthropometry and Pubertal Stage \n  \nChild’s weight and height were measured objectively in light clothes prior to the scanning session. Pubertal development was assessed with a pictogram containing a set of scaled drawings depicting external sex characteristics such as the size of breasts and the development of pubic hair presented to mothers [ ]. \n\n\n#### 2.3.3. Child Psychopathology \n  \nWe assessed child psychopathology using the DAWBA [ ]. The DAWBA is one of the most commonly used tools for the identification of mental health problems in youths [ ]. \n\nMoreover, the SDQ [ ] was used as an additional screening tool. The SDQ is a brief behavioral questionnaire that assesses children and adolescents’ mental health on different subscales, such as emotional difficulties, conduct problems, hyperactivity problems, peer relationship difficulties and prosocial problems. It returns a score for each of these components, in addition to a total score. \n\n\n#### 2.3.4. Global Intelligence \n  \nIntelligence was assessed using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence II (WASI-II) [ ]. The WASI includes four individual tests that assess full-scale IQ (FIQ). \n\n\n#### 2.3.5. Neurocognitive Function \n  \nNeurocognitive functions were assessed using the computerized Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB,  , accessed on 1 January 2019). The Attention Switching Task (AST) measures cognitive flexibility, Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) assesses sustained attention, and the Spatial Working Memory task (SWM) evaluates working memory. \n\n##### Attention Switching Task (AST) \n  \nThe AST assesses the ability to switch attention between arrow positions and directions, ignoring irrelevant information in the face of a distractor. Arrows appear on the left or right side of the screen and can point left or right. A cue at the top of the screen indicates whether the participant should press left or right, depending on the direction or position of the arrow. Some trials are position–direction-congruent (e.g., the arrow on the right side of the screen points to the right), while others are discordant and require higher cognitive demands. We recorded measures of performance (i.e., number of correct trials), response time, switching cost (i.e., difference in response between blocks with switching rules and blocks with rules remaining constant) and congruency cost (a difference in reaction time between congruent and incongruent condition). \n\n\n##### Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) \n  \nRVP is a sensitive task to assess sustained attention. Numbers 2 to 9 are presented in pseudorandom order at a rate of 100 digits per minute. Participants are asked to recognize a target sequence of digits (e.g., 2-4-6, 3-5-7). We evaluated error measures and strategies (use of heuristic search sequences to maximize performance in the task). \n\n\n##### Spatial Working Memory (SWM) \n  \nThe SWM task is a measure of sustained attention and working memory where participants are asked to keep and manipulate visuospatial information. An increasing number of boxes is shown in each trial, and participants are asked to find the one that contains a target token through a process of elimination (i.e., the token cannot be in the same box twice). We recorded measures of errors and strategy to accomplish the task. \n\n\n\n\n### 2.4. MRI Session \n  \nParticipants were scanned on a Siemens Avanto 3T clinical MRI system at Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL using a 64-channel head coil. \n\nA T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE (Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo) scan was acquired with repetition time (TR) = 2300 ms; echo time (TE) = 2.74 ms; voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm ; field of view = 256 mm; slice thickness = 1 mm; flip angle = 8°. \n\nResting-state fMRI data were collected using multi-band acceleration factor = 2; volumes = 300; TR = 1240 ms; TE = 26 ms; voxel size = 2.5 × 2.5 × 2.5 mm; slices = 40; slice thickness = 2.5 mm; field of view = 200 mm; flip angle = 75°. Resting-state acquisition time lasted approximately six minutes. \n\n\n### 2.5. Data Analysis \n  \n#### 2.5.1. Demographic Data and Neurocognitive Function \n  \nAll variables were examined individually to check for inconsistencies/outliers and their distribution. Demographic variables and covariates were compared across groups using chi-square (for categorical variables) and   t  -tests (for continuous variables). \n\nIn order to estimate neurocognitive differences, all output scores were included as dependent variables in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with group as a fixed factor and age and FIQ as covariates. F-value,   p  -value, and eta-squared (η ) as measures of effect size are reported for each analysis. \n\nExploratory post hoc analyses were performed to study the effect of maternal diagnosis (AN vs. BN) on our results by stratifying analyses by maternal diagnosis. \n\nAll statistical analyses on neurocognitive outcomes were carried out using JASP ( , accessed on 1 January 2019). Statistical significance threshold was set at   p   ≤ 0.05 for all analyses. \n\n\n#### 2.5.2. Resting-State fMRI Analysis \n  \nPreprocessing of the resting-state fMRI data were performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping v.12 (SPM12,  , UCL, London, UK) software and a wavelet-based method accessed on 1 January 2019 [ ]. Preprocessing standard steps included slice timing correction, re-alignment, co-registration of functional images to the anatomical T1-weighted images followed by the spatial normalization to an unbiased standard template for pediatric data [ ]. Based on the study population’s age range, we chose the brain template associated with the closest age range (age range: 7.5–13.5 years old) ( , accessed on 1 January 2019. McConnell Brain Imaging Center, University St Montreal, Canada), accessed on 1 January 2019. The next step included spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel with a full-width half-maximum of 6 mm. We then applied a wavelet despiking technique for denoising signal transients related to head movements [ ]. Participants showing head motion of more than 3 mm of displacement and 0.5 degrees of rotation in any direction were excluded. Based on these exclusion criteria, we excluded one FHR offspring and one control from further analyses. Neither the mean nor the maximal head motion differed between the two groups (  p   > 0.05 for both; average mean/maximal head motion for the control group: 0.03/0.72; average mean/maximal head motion for the patient group: 0.03/0.36). \n\nSpatial probabilistic independent component analysis (ICA, temporal concatenation method) on FMRIB software library (FSL) 3.14 Melodic ICA software (FMRIB, Oxford, UK) [ ] was used to identify resting-state networks across all participants. Preprocessed images from each participant (32 inputs) were entered into the ICA. High-pass temporal filtering was applied to exclude signal with a frequency under 0.01 Hz. We used the Laplace approximation to estimate the number of components. The output resulted in 40 independent components (ICs) common for the entire group of participants. Each IC was associated with a Z-map and a time-series. Each map was thresholded at a posterior probability threshold of   p   = 0.5, using an alternative hypothesis-testing approach based on the fit of a Gaussian/Gamma mixture model [ ]. In a second step, based on these group ICs, we applied a dual regression approach to characterize each IC in each participant, through a Z-map and an individual time-series [ ]. Independent components that included non-grey-matter regions, cerebellum, or were associated with high frequency signal (>0.1 Hz) were excluded from further analyses. We then identified the components covering the known resting-state networks, such as the DMN (n = 4), the CEN (n = 2), the SMN (n = 2), and the VN (n = 2) ( ). The group ICA revealed four components covering the regions defined as part of the DMN [ ] ( ). Two components covered the posterior parts of the DMN with the IC6 including the posterior cingulate cortex/retrosplenial cortex and angular gyri and the IC35 mostly including the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex. Two other components covered the anterior and dorsal parts of the DMN: the IC11 mostly included the anterior cingulate cortex, while the IC28 was mostly located in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. Four other components covered regions involved in central executive function such as the right and left working memory networks (IC3 and IC5, covering the lateral parietal–frontal cortex [ ]); the dorsal attentional network (DAN, IC9, covering the intraparietal sulcus and frontal eye field [ ]) and the salience network (IC20, covering the anterior insulas and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [ ]). Two components covered the dorsal and ventral regions of the SMN (IC4 and IC30, respectively). Lastly, two components covered the medial and lateral regions of the VN (IC1 and IC12, respectively). \n\nAfter resting-state network extraction, second-level analyses were performed in order to determine spatial extent differences for each network between the groups. Individual Z-maps were entered into a second-level random-effects analyses separately for each network. Each comparison was restricted to the positive voxels of the network of interest (  p   < 0.001). We reported significant spatial differences at   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected, T > 3.4) with a cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05 (FDR corrected, corresponding to a spatial extent of minimum 20 voxels, approximately). All analyses were adjusted for age and pubertal development. \n\n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Demographic Information \n  \nChildren did not differ in age, pubertal development, general intelligence (FIQ). Maternal age, education and ethnicity were comparable across groups (see   for details). Fourteen women received a lifetime diagnosis of AN, 2 of BN. \n\n\n### 3.2. Neurocognitive Function \n  \nAll neurocognitive results are available in  . We found a statistically significant effect of group (F(1,32) = 5.53,   p   = 0.02) on the AST in regard to the switching cost index, adjusting for age and FIQ, with a large effect size. Children at FHR for EDs had higher scores (i.e., they were slower in switching rule) compared with controls. No other statistically significant difference was detected in relation to spatial working memory and sustained attention (all   p  -values > 0.05), although there was a trend in girls at FHR for EDs having higher scores on SWM strategy (i.e., better use of a strategy to succeed in the SWM task) compared with controls, with a medium effect size. \n\nIn post hoc analyses, girls at FHR for AN showed higher switching cost scores in the AST compared with HC (F(1,30) = 6.86,   p   = 0.01), correcting for age and FIQ, confirming findings highlighted in the larger group. \n\n\n### 3.3. Resting-State fMRI \n  \nIndependent components covering the resting-state networks are shown in  . \n\nWe found spatial differences between groups in component parts of each of the four major networks (DMN, SMN, VN and CEN; all   p   < 0.05 FDR-corrected at the cluster-level). The posterior DMN (IC6) showed a reduction in spatial extent in two clusters located in the angular and middle temporal gyri in children at FHR for ED, while the dorsal DMN (IC28) showed reduction in the medial superior frontal gyrus. The same pattern was seen in the ventral SMN (IC30) and in two clusters located in the postcentral and inferior temporal gyri of the DAN (IC9). \n\nLastly, two clusters of the medial VN (IC1), corresponding to the fusiform and superior occipital gyri, showed increased activity in offspring at FHR for EDs relative to controls. Group comparisons are presented in   and  . \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThis preliminary study is the first to investigate cognitive and neural markers of ED in FHR offspring. We compared cognitive and neural characteristics in girls at FHR for EDs (i.e., born to mothers with a past or current ED) and control girls (born to mothers with no history of EDs or other psychiatric disorders). Girls at FHR for EDs performed worse than controls in an attentional switching task, and differences between groups emerged in FC among resting-state networks. Girls at FHR showed decreased FC in the DMN, the SMN, and the DAN, whereas increased FC in the VN compared with controls. \n\nOur results suggest that children at FHR for EDs present cognitive rigidity when switching, similar to what is seen in individuals with EDs, particularly AN [ ]. Cognitive switching refers to the ability to switch attention from one mental state/task to another [ ], and it is a core executive function. Difficulties in set-shifting in ED have been widely reported in the literature, although they seem clearer for AN than BN [ , , ]. Results from our post hoc analyses are in line with these data, showing that girls at FHR for AN had significant difficulty in set-shifting compared with controls. Studies in healthy sisters or mothers of individuals with ED have shown mixed results. Healthy sisters of individuals with ED, mostly AN, but also BN and ED in general, have difficulties in cognitive switching compared with their ill sisters [ , , , ]. However, other evidence has shown normal set shifting in unaffected sisters of women with AN [ , , ]. Our preliminary findings suggest a deficit in cognitive flexibility as a strong candidate as an endophenotype of ED, particularly AN. \n\nEvidence of an impact of ED on working memory shows conflicting results [ , ]. In a community-based study, we showed increased performance in working memory in children of mothers with EDs [ ]. Although we found a trend in the same direction, we did not replicate these findings in the current study. \n\nOffspring at FHR showed decreased FC in the DMN, the DAN, and the SMN, as well as increased FC in the medial VN. In our study, children at high risk for EDs showed decreased FC within the DMN posterior areas (the angular and middle temporal gyrus), and the medial superior frontal gyrus. Such posterior regions play an important role in converging multisensory information and reorienting attention, manipulating mental states and social-affective dimensions [ , ]. Abnormal activation in these areas have been reported in adults [ ] and adolescents [ ] with AN. \n\nThe superior frontal gyrus is known to be related to self-awareness [ ]. Aberrant connectivity in these areas could be related to body image distortion, a common feature of ED [ , ]. Notably, girls at FHR for EDs also showed differences in FC in the medial VN, specifically in regions involved in face and object recognition [ ] such as the right fusiform gyrus and the left superior occipital gyrus. In a speculative fashion, we might consider this as a unique system deputed to body image processing, characterized by an abnormal processing of basic visual information (visual areas) reflected in the body-image distortion processed by high-level structures (frontal regions). Our findings might point towards this being a neural marker of distorted body image perception present in girls at FHR for EDs. \n\nDecreased FC in the SMN has been shown in patients with BN [ ], as well as in patients with restrictive AN [ ]. Altered FC in this region may reflect abnormal patterns of inhibitory control and response in ED patients [ , , ]. The presence of decreased FC in this network in children at FHR warrants the need to investigate its role as a neural endophenotype of EDs, as well as the reduced FC in the DAN, a network involved in voluntary orienting attention [ ]. \n\n### Strengths and Limitations \n  \nOne of the strengths of this study is its design, i.e., the first study using the FHR design in healthy children with no ED symptoms. This allows for measurements of potential endophenotypes that are less biased by confounding factors such as illness state. An intrinsic strength of this study is the innovation of both a neurocognitive and a neural investigation, this allows a broader and deeper understanding of potential markers of high risks for EDs. \n\nThis study has some limitations. First, given its preliminary nature, our sample size is small. Given the sample size, although all appropriate statistical steps were taken, we cannot exclude false negatives due to low statistical power. Larger studies are necessary to confirm our findings. We are currently carrying out a larger study of children at FHR for EDs, aimed at extending our findings. Secondly, in the same experimental group, we included offspring of mothers with AN and BN, based on many transdiagnostic theories that suggest similar pathophysiology for these disorders [ , ]. Future studies will aim to investigate FHR for each diagnostic group by including male population as well, that has been largely neglected in this research field so far. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nThis study highlights a difficulty in cognitive flexibility as a potential endophenotype of ED (particularly AN). We were able to also identify abnormal FC in the DMN, the SMN, the DAN, and the VN as neural correlates of FHR status for EDs. Taken together, such differences in FC parallel altered perception and processing of body image, abnormal attentional orienting, set-shifting, and inhibition control seen in patients with Eds. These findings might apply mostly to FHR status for AN given the diagnostic split of our sample. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"cee6e0ab545637bf53b90ad166aff167"},

However, how this age-induced alteration impacts dynamic brain function interaction has not yet been fully investigated. Dynamic function network connectivity (DFNC) analysis can produce a brain representation based on the time-varying network connectivity changes, which can be further used to study the brain aging mechanism for people at different age stages. \n\n\n## Method \n  \nThis presented investigation examined the dynamic functional connectivity representation and its relationship with brain age for people at an elderly stage as well as in early adulthood. Specifically, the resting-state fMRI data from the University of North Carolina cohort of 34 young adults and 28 elderly participants were fed into a DFNC analysis pipeline. This DFNC pipeline forms an integrated dynamic functional connectivity (FC) analysis framework, which consists of brain functional network parcellation, dynamic FC feature extraction, and FC dynamics examination. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe statistical analysis demonstrates that extensive dynamic connection changes in the elderly concerning the transient brain state and the method of functional interaction in the brain. In addition, various machine learning algorithms have been developed to verify the ability of dynamic FC features to distinguish the age stage. The fraction time of DFNC states has the highest performance, which can achieve a classification accuracy of over 88% by a decision tree. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe results proved there are dynamic FC alterations in the elderly, and the alteration was found to be correlated with mnemonic discrimination ability and could have an impact on the balance of functional integration and segregation. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nAging has a profound influence on the brain's structure and function at both local and global scales. These effects are responsible for decreased mental and physical fitness (Cole et al.,  ) and increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (Abbott,  ), or Parkinson's disease (Dennis and Thompson,  ; Reeve et al.,  ). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful and efficient, accessible and non-invasive tool, which has been extensively used to reveal neural mechanisms engaged in the normal aging process. It has also contributed greatly to elucidating the role that aging plays in the decline of brain function [e.g., the cognitive (Uddin et al.,  ) or motor function (Thomason et al.,  )]. More precisely, resting-state fMRI studies have frequently reported altered connectivity both within-network and between-network. In human aging the findings encountered include: the functional connectivity (FC) decreases within higher-order networks and segregation of networks diminishes with advancing age. For example, within the default network, the salience network, and the frontoparietal control network, FC has been reported to be reduced (Fjell et al.,  ; Grady et al.,  ). This FC alteration could be a sign of neural or functional network reorganization, however, these findings rely on the static functional network connectivity analysis (SFNC). One potential limitation of SFNC is the theoretical assumption that the FC exhibits a constant state during a rest MRI period. This means that the fine-grained temporal evaluation of resting state has been neglected, and the flexibility of the functional network reorganization cannot be assessed. \n\nRecently, with the advances in understanding of the temporal resolution of resting-state fMRI, the interest in how normal human aging affects the time-varying or dynamic functional network connectivity (DFNC) has increased (Calhoun et al.,  ). For instance, the loss or decline of FC dynamics has been wildly found in the elderly adult group (Schaefer et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). This temporal variation of FC reflects the network flexibility necessary for brain function response, which fits our intuitive perception of the elderly who have the loss of physical flexibility. In contrast with SFNC, an advantage of DFNC is that it allows the fluctuation of FC, within or between the brain functional networks, over short periods to be observed. Identification of the FC fluctuation patterns allows the brain's FC state profile to be identified. Following which, features characterizing the FC dynamics, such as the transition trajectories between distinct brain states (Allen et al.,  ; Vidaurre et al.,  ) can then be used to interpret brain behaviors. \n\nGiven such a capacity, DFNC has been increasingly applied to brain aging. For instance, the DFNC method has demonstrated that the FC dynamics degenerate in normal aging. This degeneration is reflected by the lower switching rate between brain states within salience network (Snyder et al.,  ) and default network (Xia et al.,  ), as well as by the decreased connectivity flexibility in the right middle frontal gyrus (Yin et al.,  ). The FC dynamics has also been demonstrated to correlate with cognitive ability (Xia et al.,  ). Studies using DFNC methods have revealed other opinions regarding dynamic FC. For example, FC dynamics is usually characterized by the switching rate of connectivity states, which is defined as the rate at which a state transitions between potential functional brain states over a certain period. However, in a study investigating the human brain across the lifespan, for example, the switching rate of brain state was observed to have no difference between different age groups (Viviano et al.,  ). These distinct results are possibly due to differences in the implementation method and the data samples. While the results are not consistent, all these collected findings imply that the DFNC analysis is a promising method for providing insight into human aging neuromechanisms from multiple views and means. \n\nTherefore, in this research, we explore the brains of two age-different groups with the DFNC method, to track the FC dynamics in the elderly over the MRI scan and to investigate the relationship between dynamic FC and age. Overall, we expect that the study of DFNC can reveal and track the change in flexibility of function coordination and interaction in the elderly, and this alteration can facilitate brain age estimation at an individual level. This research also has the potential to form the basis for further investigations which may provide a deeper understanding of brain changes and aging. This could offer clues to the relationship between brain maturity and brain behaviors as well as age-induced diseases. \n\nSpecifically, the resting-state functional MRI data from 34 younger adults aged 19–22 and 28 elderly adults aged 60–80 have been tested by an implemented DFNC analysis pipeline. The fMRI data is used to identify the intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), from which the brain states are estimated and the dynamic features extracted. The alterations in FC dynamics caused by aging were examined, and the power of dynamic features in individual age prediction was evaluated in this framework. In addition, we have also discussed the relationship between dynamic features and mnemonic discrimination ability and the dynamic balance of functional integration and segregation in healthy aging. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and methods \n  \n### 2.1. fMRI acquisition \n  \nResting-state scans were obtained from the University of North Carolina samples at Greensboro  after request, without any rights conflicts. The participants were 28 elderly adults (61–80 years old, mean age ± standard: 69.82 ± 5.64; 20 female) and 34 young (18–32 years old, mean age ± standard deviation(SD): 22.21 ± 3.65; 20 female). Participants were instructed to lie motionlessly in the scanner and stay awake with their eyes open. All functional images were collected using a Siemens Trio 3.0T scanner with a 16-channel head coil and the following recording parameters: 32 slices with 4.0 mm thickness and no skip, time of echo = 30 ms; time of repetition (TR) = 2,000 ms; flip angle = 70, field of view = 220 mm, matrix size = 74 × 74 × 32 voxels, 300 volumes in 10 min. \n\n\n### 2.2. fMRI data preprocessing \n  \nThe data for each participant has 300 measurements recorded over 10 min. The first five volumes of each scan were discarded to allow for magnetic stability and thus to generate a steady blood oxygenation level-dependent activity signal. The functional data was then processed with the following steps: \n  \nRealignment to correct head motion (see Section 2.3 for verification details). \n  \nSlice time correction. \n  \nOutlier identification. \n  \nNormalization (normalize to 3 mm MNI space using a templates from the SPM software package; Ashburner and Friston,  ). \n  \nSpatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). \n  \nThe processing pipeline was executed using the CONN toolbox (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon,  ). \n\n\n### 2.3. Verification of head motion correction \n  \nTo verify there was no significant head movement in the data, for each participant the individual mean and maximum framewise displacements (FD) (Power et al.,  ) were calculated. As the participants with large outlier scans have been removed from the raw data, none of the available participants had head motion greater than 0.5 mm. No significant group difference in FD was observable when comparing the final sample of 28 old adults and 34 young adults (  p   = 0.92). \n\n\n### 2.4. Static functional network connectivity analysis \n  \nTo assess static connectivity, pairwise Pearson correlations were computed over the entire timeseries and then Fisher's Z-transformed. Group ICA-based was used to produce brain parcellations according to the same procedure as described in Section 2.5.1. This calculation resulted in correlation coefficients per participant, which represent the connectivity strength between the given ICNs. Then, the static connectivity matrices were averaged across the young and elderly adult groups. \n\nThe difference in static connectivity between the young and elderly groups was evaluated through a two-sample   t  -test (a significance level of   p   < 0.05). The correction for multiple comparisons was applied using false discovery rate (FDR)-correction to determine statistical significance at   p   < 0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg,  ). \n\n\n### 2.5. Dynamic functional network connectivity analysis \n  \n shows the framework of our DFNC approach. Specifically, there are five main steps in this pipeline: \n  \nGroup independent component analysis (ICA) parcellation for intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) recognition, \n  \nSliding window cross-correlation, \n  \nClustering analysis for brain state estimation, \n  \nDynamic feature extraction, \n  \nFC dynamics examination   via   statistics and machine learning tests. \n    \nThe dynamic functional connectivity analysis pipeline. The timeseries signal was extracted from the network regions recognized from the group ICA parcellation method. Then, the regional timeseries were decomposed with a sliding window scheme for a time-varying function network connectivity (FNC) estimation. Those FNC matrixes were fed into a clustering algorithm to obtain different transient brain states by forming a cluster centroid. After that, two types of dynamic features were calculated based on the acquired transient states and temporal signals. Finally, statistical and machine learning methods were applied to verify the extracted dynamic FC features. \n  \nDetails of each step are provided in the following sections. \n\n#### 2.5.1. Step 1: Group independent component analysis parcellation \n  \nGroup ICA was performed in order to parcellate the brain into various functional networks. Following the recommendations from previous studies (Allen et al.,  ; Abrol et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ), the number of components that can functionally parcellate the brain was predefined at 100. The configuration for the group information-guided ICA algorithm was developed according to the detailed description provided by Salman et al. ( ). In particular, we adopt the two-stage Principal Component Algorithm (PCA) to preserve the components that account for the most variance. In the first stage, each participants' functional data was decomposed into 120 principal components (PCs), and the PCs of all participants were concatenated across time and then further reduced to 100 in the second stage. Finally, the infomax algorithm, from the ICASSO software package (Himberg and Hyvarinen,  ), was used with 20 repeats to find steady independent components (ICs). After back reconstruction, the participant-specific spatial maps and corresponding time courses can be obtained. Three methods were employed to detect the ICNs from potential functional networks: \n  \nThe spatial activation maps from the ICs were visually inspected to identify if they match the large-scale functional network locations from previous studies (Di and Biswal,  ; Kim et al.,  ) and anatomical brain regions. \n  \nThe multiple regression method was used to select ICs whose spatial pattern matches with the existing functional networks template given by: \n    \nwhere   Y   is the collection of the spatial vector of template ICNs,   X   represents the spatial vector of the   i  -th IC and β is the regression coefficient. The regression analysis is used to select the ICs closest to the functional network template spatially (the first rank of β), and the calculation is done by least-squares estimation. \n  \n(3) The power spectrum of the ICs was checked to see if it follows a low-frequency peak and a high-frequency steady pattern (the time courses of ICs are characterized by high dynamic range) (Griffanti et al.,  ). \n  \nFollowing the practice presented in Tu et al. ( ) and Bonkhoff et al. ( ), before passing the ICNs to the subsequent steps of the DFNC pipeline, additional post-processing of the time courses of all included ICNs was performed. The post-processing involved (a) linear, quadratic, and cubic detrending, (b) regressing out motion parameters (six realignment parameters and their first temporal derivatives), (c) low-pass filtering with a high-frequency cut-off of 0.15 Hz (to retain only BOLD-related signal fluctuations; Calhoun et al.,  ), and (d) despiking using 3D despike. These actions ensure artifact noise has minimal impact on the signal analysis. \n\n\n#### 2.5.2. Step 2: Sliding window cross-correlation scheme \n  \nIn the second step a sliding window is used to segment the timeseries of the ICNs into sub-fragments. For each time window the correlations between the ICNs during that window were calculated. There is no consensus in terms of the window size and the length of the sliding step. However, prior studies provide evidence that a window size between 30s and 60s enables successful estimation of DFNC giving an appropriate balance between accurate calculation of the correlation and the ability to detect time variations in the ICN timeseries (Hindriks et al.,  ; Liegeois et al.,  ; Preti et al.,  ). Thus, in our experiment, we opted for the common parameter settings, where the width of the window is 22 TR time (Kim et al.,  ; Bonkhoff et al.,  ), windows were convolved with a Gaussian of σ = 3 TR to smooth the transition between windows (Allen et al.,  ), and the window shifted with a step of 1 TR (Tu et al.,  ; Bonkhoff et al.,  ). The window cross-correlation produced 273 correlation matrices, representing the fluctuation of functional connectivity between the identified ICNs. These matrices are Fisher's Z transformed before being passed to step 3 for clustering analysis. \n\n\n#### 2.5.3. Step 3: Clustering analysis for brain state estimation \n  \nRecurrent or repeating connectivity patterns in an fMRI scan are known as dynamic brain states. To identify these brain states clustering is performed using the k-means based clustering algorithm. The distance between clustering points was computed using the Manhattan distance (i.e., the “city-block”), which is the distance metric recommended for high-dimensional-space clustering (Aggarwal et al.,  ). The number of clusters is automatically computed by maximizing the ratio of within-cluster distance and between-cluster distance, and the optimal candidate is then manually estimated using the elbow method (Allen et al.,  ; Bonkhoff et al.,  ). For each subject the correlation matrices from step 2 were grouped into different clusters according to the distance from the clustering centroid. This results in state labels for each of the time windows which are used in the dynamic feature calculations in the next step in order to investigate the difference between the young and elderly adult groups. \n\n\n#### 2.5.4. Step 4: Dynamic feature extraction \n  \nNext, the FC temporal characteristic evaluation as well as the dynamic graph analysis were performed. Following (Allen et al.,  ; Bonkhoff et al.,  ), using the state labels, four FC temporal characteristics were calculated as features for the between-group difference: (i) state fraction: the percentage of the total number of FC windows for one subject which take the given state; (ii) mean dwell times: the mean time a subject spent in a state without switching to another one; (iii) number of transitions: how many times a subject changed states; and (iv) transition probability matrix: the transition likelihood between the k connectivity states. \n\nThe rationale behind the dynamic graph analysis is that, with the FC potentially fluctuating with each time window, so too the topological structure of the graph can vary. For the dynamic graph analysis, as shown in step 4 in  , the ICNs were defined as the nodes in the graph and the FC between them as the edges, thus for each participant a graph is obtained for each time window. To define the adjacency of the nodes a threshold can be applied to the edges in the graph to produce an undirected and binary adjacency matrix. However, as the topological structure is not constant within one graph if using different network thresholds, the network sparsity method has been adopted in our experiment to avoid the bias of unstable measures in between-group dynamic feature comparison (Zhang et al.,  ; Kim et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ). Similar to prior studies (Hashmi et al.,  ; van den Heuvel et al.,  ; Tu et al.,  ), 10 thresholds ranging from 0.05 to 0.50 with a step of 0.05 were used to obtain the sparse network. Each threshold produced an adjacency matrix for each DFNC matrix. \n\nHaving obtained the adjacency matrices then, graph theory was applied to investigate the topological organization of the DFNC state and the series of graphs. Specifically, we use 12 graph metrics to measure the graph characteristics and dynamics during the fMRI scan. For example, network efficiency, measures how efficiently a node exchanges information or communicates with other nodes within a network. The other selected metrics include assortativity, global and local efficiency, and synchronization, which depict a brain function network's resilience, segregation, and integration. Detailed definitions of these graph metrics and their formulas are listed in  :  . To balance the sparsity selection for the sequence of thresholds, the area under the curve (AUC) for the metric values was computed. Then, the AUC was utilized as a graph feature for further analysis. \n\n\n#### 2.5.5. Step 5: Statistics and machine learning tests \n  \nThe final step in the pipeline conducts statistical testing to examine the results. To obtain robust and reliable results on aging-related variations within and between groups, a non-parametric permutation test with 5,000 randomizations was implemented for all of the dynamic features produced in the DFNC analysis pipeline. The difference in the means of the distributions yielded after the 5,000 random permutations served as the t statistic. In addition, we investigated the presence of the distinct transient brain states across different age groups by performing a two-sample   t  -test. All statistical results were corrected by false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple comparison correction with a significance level of   p   < 0.05. \n\nMeanwhile, nine machine learning algorithms were implemented to examine the power of the dynamic features to predict the age of an individual. These algorithms were exploited to learn a mapping from the raw fMRI space,  , to the age distribution of participants,  . That is:   given the fMRI scan collection of training samples  . Here,   N   is the number of training sample scans,   is the input scan and   is the associated age label indicating if the participant is an elderly adult.   is the function extracting dynamic FC features, and   V   is the number of features. \n\nThese algorithms were all implemented using the sklearn python package. For the 6 methods listed in   the default setup with the given parameters was used. In addition, we developed a neural network method using Keras's deep learning package. Considering our small sample data size could cause problems with over-fitting in the training phase for complicated network structures, a 2-layer forward neural network (FNN) was developed. The first and second layers of the neural network compose of 256 and 2 neurons (corresponding to the number of age categories). At the end of the first and second layers, there is a tanh and sigmoid activation function to learn the non-linear mapping relationship. The model is trained by minimizing the loss function: \n  \nMachine learning algorithms and their parameters. \n  \nwhere   p   is the predicted probability. Finally, we test two ensemble fusion-based methods: one is Adaboost (Hastie et al.,  ), and the other one is Voting (Ruta and Gabrys,  ). Both algorithms try to promote prediction performance by weighting multiple embedded estimators. In the Adaboost method, the default setup was opted for. In the voting method, the ensemble rule was set to be “hard”, which means that the predicted class labels for majority voting will be the final prediction results. \n\nThe dynamic feature output by   g   was singly fed into these machine learning methods to examine whether the aging group classification facilitates dynamic classification. In addition, we have also cascaded the outputs of   together to examine if the concatenated dynamic feature can promote the performance. \n\n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Intrinsic connectivity networks \n  \nOf the 100 ICs identified by the group ICA, 40 ICs were identified as noise components and then discarded. The remaining 60 components were finally identified as ICNs. The 60 ICNs were assigned to one of six domains that have been widely studied in normal aging (Xia et al.,  ; Snyder et al.,  ) ( ): subcortical domain (SC), auditory domain (AUD), visual domain (VIS), sensorimotor domain (SM), cognitive control domain (CC), and default mode domain (DMN). The detailed component labels and peak coordinates of each ICN have been provided in the  :  . \n  \nSpatial maps of the 60 independent components result from the entire group (28 elderly and 34 younger adults). The coordinates denote the max peak location of functional domains, and different colors pass spatial information. AUD, auditory domain; CC, cognitive control domain; DMN, default mode domain; SC, subcortical; SM, sensorimotor domain; VIS, visual domain. \n  \n\n### 3.2. Static functional network connectivity analysis \n  \n shows the static functional network connectivity aggregated over the entire scanning time series using the group ICA method. The red color indicates a positive correlation, and the blue color represents a negative correlation between functional spatial regions. With the static functional network connectivity, we observed strong intra-domain connectivity, i.e., connectivity within the DMN, SMN, VIS, and AUD domains was positively correlated. In contrast, the inter-domain connectivity was comparably low, where the functional regions in the 6 domains were either independent of each other or negatively connected. This phenomenon was particularly obvious for the SC domain, where the connectivity with the other 5 domains was nearly all negative. Within the SC domain, the brain areas also exhibit negative connectivity. \n  \n (A)   Static functional network connectivity between 60 independent components resulting in 1770 ( 60 × (60-1)/2 )connectivity pairs for the entire group. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the elderly and younger groups.   (B)   Circle plot of significant static functional network connectivity differences of 6 domain between the elderly adult and younger group. \n  \nFurther reviewing the difference in connectivity from the elderly group and the younger using a two-sample   t  -test, 193 connectivity pairs show significantly altered between-network connectivity components. The significant alterations in ICNs have been denoted with an asterisk in  , from which we can see that these alterations are mainly related to the CC domain. Post   t  -tests, contrasting elderly adults and younger controls, reveals aging-induced reduced connectivity (  p   < 0.05, FDR-corrected). From  , we can see only the connectivity between SM and CC domains was left after post   t  -tests in group ICA (  p   < 0.05, FDR-corrected). This result shows consistency with the studies that show higher connectivity between the somatosensory and control network (Geerligs et al.,  ). \n\n\n### 3.3. Dynamic functional network connectivity analysis \n  \n#### 3.3.1. DFNC State \n  \nFour DFNC states were identified from the clustering. The identified states were the functional patterns that frequently reoccurred across all the participants, and are stable characterizations of the brain activity during the fMRI scanning. The four states are presented in   indexed with the order given by k-means. \n  \n (A)   Four functional connectivity states as well as their frequencies across all participants using the group-ICA method.   (B)   Group differences of the 6 selected brain networks between elderly and younger adults in the 4 states. AUD, auditory domain; CC, cognitive control domain; DM, default mode domain; SC, subcortical; SM, sensorimotor domain; VIS, visual domain. \n  \nAccording to the connectivity pattern, the states can be grouped into two categories. State 1 and 4 compose the first class, characterized by dense inter-and intra-domain connectivity. We can observe highly positive between-AUD domain connectivity and negative between-SC domain connectivity. State 1 closely matches the static connectivity in terms of Manhattan distance. The second category involves states 2 and 3. Compared with the first, this class featured relatively weak and sparse connectivity, which is particularly obvious for the SC and AUD domains. Thus, we refer to the category as the weakly connected class. The state frequency of two connectivity types also supports this classification, in which the frequencies of two states in class 1 are no more than 20%, which is less than that of class 2 (which accounts for 70% in total for all subjects). Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the strong positive connectivity within VIS can be observed for all 4 states. \n\nEven though the DFNC states exhibit two categories, group differences for each state are varied (see  ). Within state 1, the elderly adults have slightly lower connectivity between VIS and CC while having relatively higher connectivity between VIS and the AUD domain (  p   < 0.05, FDR-corrected). In state 2, the connectivity between VIS and CC in the elder group shows a further decline. At the same time, significantly increased connectivity between DMN and AUD and CC and AUD can be found in this state. The only significantly different intra-domain connectivity was observed in state 4. The result shows that within state 4, the elderly group has markedly stronger connectivity in the VIS domain than younger adults (post   t  -tests:   p   < 0.05, FDR-corrected). Similar to state 1, the weaker connectivity between VIS and AUD domains can also be observed in state 4. We did not find any significantly different connectivity in state 3 between the two groups (post   t  -tests:   p   < 0.05, FDR-corrected). In contrast to the connectivity difference that the static connectivity state exhibits between the two groups, there is no significant difference between CC and SMN after the FDR-corrected in all 4 states. \n\n\n#### 3.3.2. DFNC temporal features \n  \nWith four dynamic functional connectivity states and window-based FNC matrices, we subsequently tested for between-group differences in the measures of dynamic features (see  ). Two sample   t  -tests comparing younger and elderly adults revealed a significant difference in the dynamic measures (fraction and dwell time) of state 2 as well as state 3 (i.e., the weak connectivity pattern,   p   < 0.05, FDR-corrected). In contrast to younger adults, the elderly prefer states 2 and 3 (  p   = 0.0001), and they are more likely to stay in states 2 and 3 once they enter these states (  p   = 0.0001). The between-group difference in dwell time of state 3 is more prominent (  p   < 0.0001). No significant between-group difference was observed in terms of the number of state transitions. \n  \nDynamic connectivity feature analysis for the elderly and younger groups.   (A)   The fraction of time the occurrence of DFC state 2 and state 3 has significant between group difference. The elder prefer state 2 (  P   < 0.05) and state 3 (  P   < 0.05).   (B)   The dwell time. Once again, the senior group is more like to stay within state 2 and state 3.   (C)   The number of transition between states. There is no significant difference in the number of state transition between two groups.   (D)   State Transition Probability matrix. Comparing with younger adults, the older people more inclined to switch to state 3 when they are in state 1, 2, or 4. However, they are also more likely to transfer to other state when they are entering state 3 than younger people. *  p   < 0.05, ***  p   < 0.001, and ****  p   < 0.001 FDR corrected. \n  \nWith respect to the transition probability matrix between states, there were significant between-group effects on the likelihood of staying in one state stably or switch to another. Consistent with the finding that the elderly prefer to spend more time on state 3, results showed that the elderly are more inclined than younger people to switch to state 3 when the current state is not state 3. This is particularly true when the current state is state 2 (  p   = 0.0001, FDR-corrected), demonstrating why the elderly prefer state 2 but have less dwell time than state 3. However, when entering State 3, older people are less likely to remain in this state than younger ones. More elderly people prefer to switch to state 1 or state 2, while younger people tend to maintain a stable state (  p   < 0.05, FDR-corrected). When the next state is state 4, the transition probabilities of elderly and younger people do not differ. \n\nTo better utilize the dynamic connectivity features to serve aging classification, we next explored the correlation between these features and the age of participants. The dynamic connectivity features correlated with age have been listed in  . As can be seen, the fraction time and dwell time of state 2 are negatively correlated with age (fraction time:   r   = −0.639,   p   = 0.000; dwell time:   r   = −0.502,   p   = 0.000). In contrast, the fraction time and dwell time of state 3 are positively correlated with age (fraction time:   r   = 0.651,   p   = 0.000; dwell time:   r   = 0.555,   p   = 0.000). In terms of transition probability between states, the likelihood of state 1 switching to state 3, of state 3 switching to state 1, as well as state 3 switching to state 2 all have a positive correlation with age (  r   = 0.316, 0.265, 0.254,   p   = 0.012, 0.038, 0.046, respectively), while the probability of switching from state 3 to state 3 is negatively correlated with age (  r   = −0.409,   p   < 0.001). \n  \nDynamic state features correlated with age. \n  \n\n#### 3.3.3. Dynamic graph analysis \n  \nTo explore the age effect on the functional network topology, the subsequent work employed graph theory to characterize the dynamic graph changing during fMRI scanning. Various graph metrics have been utilized, which can describe multiple network properties. These graph measures were calculated based on the sparsing-threshold binary networks per participant and then averaged within the group. Subsequently, they were tested for between-group differences in terms of graph dynamics. \n\nFirstly, we observed a significant between-group difference in global efficiency (  t   = 6.5046,   p   < 0.0001), local efficiency (  t   = −11.4388,   p   < 0.0001), synchronization (  t   = 2.2756,   p   = 0.0232), hierarchy (  t   = 12.384,   p   < 0.0001), modularity (  t   = 16.1638,   p   < 0.0001), the shortest path (  t   = −11.4388,   p   < 0.0001), clustering coefficient (  t   = −4.1766,   p   < 0.0001), and the betweenness (  t   = 10.8943,   p   < 0.0001).   displays the time course of these graph metrics. In terms of efficiency, we can see that the elderly group has a higher global but lower local efficiency than the younger group, suggesting that the information transfer is more efficient in the global but less efficient in the local functional network as age grows. Across these dynamic measures, the elderly people only have three measurements significantly higher than the younger group: the synchronization coefficient, hierarchy coefficient, and modularity. These higher measures indicate that as the age increases, the synchronization ability of the functional region in the brain network increases. The raised age increases modularity and enriches the hierarchy structure. Note that the significantly higher value in elderly people is not overwhelming. At some transient time points, these younger people have a stronger performance in these measures. Examples include the weaker synchronization in the younger group at TR = 150, which is consistent with the observed lower synchronization in transient dynamic state 2 for older adults. A significant difference can also be observed in the clustering coefficient and the shortest path, which directly results in the distinguishing small-world property of the two groups. The lower small-world property implies that the elderly group is less robust to external perturbations, according to the hypothesis by Barabási ( ). In that case, it fits our biological intuition that older people are subject to damage by mutation or viral infection. However, there may be a lack of direct evidence to demonstrate a linear relationship. \n  \nTime course of multiple dynamic measures for the different age groups. \n  \nSecondly, there are three other nodal graph measures explored in our work: local efficiency, vulnerable coefficient, and betweenness, which characterize the information-transferring efficiency of a specific node, the vulnerability of a node, and the importance of the node's role in the network, respectively. Six sub-networks were observed to have significant differences between the two groups on the three measures. For the DMN network, people 60–80 years old have significantly lower local efficiency (  t   = −16.8892,   p   < 0.0001) and vulnerable coefficient (  t   = −31.5046,   p   < 0.0001) than younger people, suggesting the DMN has less efficient information transfer and a higher risk of slowing global efficiency. The same situation occurs in the VIS network (  t   = −19.9135 and −7.0166 for the two metrics, respectively). The DMN network efficiency decline can also be supported by the significantly decreased nodal betweenness (  t   = −31.8963,   p   < 0.0001), where the higher the nodal betweenness coefficient, the more likely information will transfer through the node.   shows the time-varying curve of these three measures in DMN during the fMRI scan. We can see that older people's metric curves do not have an apparent trend, but they are always lower than younger people's. Besides, the correlation between the nodal graph measures and the age for the six domains also behaved differently (see  ). The DMN's local efficiency, vulnerable coefficient, and nodal betweenness have some of the highest negative correlation values compared to the other five networks. On the other hand, the CC domain has the smallest correlation in all three measures compared to other parts. \n  \nTime varying curve of the three dynamic measures of DMN network: local efficiency, vulnerable, nodal betweenness in age-different group, where no matter which metric elder people are lowest. \n    \nThe correlation between nodal graph measures and age. \n  \n\n\n### 3.4. Machine learning test for individual age prediction \n  \nGiven that the dynamic features are significantly different between the two groups, it is natural to test their power in individual age prediction using a machine learning algorithm. \n\nFirstly, the single dynamic state feature (the fraction, MDT, etc.) was fed into the nine machine learning algorithms, respectively, to test their prediction power, with the static functional connectivity strength serving as baseline for comparison. The performance of each pipeline was evaluated with five-fold cross-validation, and the result of the test set is summarized in  . The evaluation metric is accuracy, i.e., the probability that the method correctly categorizes the candidates into the correct class. We report the mean of five-fold cross-validation results in each metric with a 95% confidence interval. \n  \nThe prediction accuracy of multiple machine learning algorithms with dynamic state features. \n  \nThe bold values represent the algorithm that achieves the best performance using the feature indicated in the column. The italic values denote the highest accuracy that the machine learning algorithm could obtain across all the input dynamic features. \n  \nAs can be seen, by using the state fraction feature, all the machine learning algorithms have an accuracy over 80%, which is higher than any other feature (except the AdaBoost method with concatenated feature). The decision tree achieves the highest accuracy of 0.886 using this feature, which is also the best performance in all of the dynamic state features. The highest accuracy for the number of transitions and transition probability is similar, 0.771 and 0.731, respectively. Meanwhile, the best performance of the number of transitions is more stable than that of transition probability, where the accuracy variance is less by 0.04. However, the number of transitions has a large gap in performance in terms of the different methods, where it can only achieve an accuracy of 0.560 with the FNN algorithm. The MDT has the lowest accuracy of 0.650. Concerning the concatenated feature, even though the results are not much worse than those for the number of transitions and transition probability, the highest accuracy is only 0.855, which is still less than the state fraction. On the other hand, with respect to the classic methods, the FNN method is the most unstable one. It obtains a mean accuracy of 0.855 using fractions while it has a 0.560 when using the transition probability as input. For the two ensemble-fusion-strategy-based methods, the voting method did not perform well for individual age prediction, though its best result is still for the fraction feature. In contrast, the AdaBoost method has achieved the best performance three times, the most frequent optimal method. \n\nSecond, similar to the dynamic state features, the dynamic graph features were also input into different machine learning algorithms. However, the results were not impressive using the single graph features (see  ,  ). All of the features do not achieve accuracy over 70%, the best accuracy was just 0.693 obtained by the SVM with the number of modularity. \n  \nThe prediction accuracy of multiple machine learning algorithms with dynamic graph features (I). \n  \nThe bold values represent the algorithm that achieves the best performance using the feature indicated in the column.

Discussion \n  \nGiven the known dynamic nature of brain activity, it is reasonable to use the DFNC method to investigate the differences in dynamics between age groups. In the study presented here, four transient brain states that frequently reoccur at rest were identified. These 4 states exhibit two types of connectivity patterns: the densely inter-and intra-domain connectivity pattern and the weakly sparse one. The elderly tend to transfer to and stay in the weakly connected state, which cannot be shown with static analysis. Notably, the fraction of these DFNC states and the dwell time were correlated with age (  r   = 0.6392/0.6507 for time fraction of state 2 and 3, respectively;   r   = 0.5022/0.5553 for the dwell time of state 2 and 3, respectively). Besides, these dynamic measures gain advantage in brain age classification compare to static ones. The fraction time of DFNC state can achieve highest accuracy of 0.8857 using a decision tree. \n\nThere is a significant difference in the dynamic graph topology found between the young group and the elderly group. Older people have higher global but lower local information transformation efficiency, stronger synchronization ability, increased betweenness, more rich modularity and hierarchy structure, shorter shortest path length, and a declining clustering coefficient than younger people. At the nodal level, elderly adults differed from younger people in terms of local efficiency, vulnerable coefficient, and betweenness. The most notable of these differences is that the information transfer efficiency, the vulnerability, and the nodal betweenness of older people's DMN are all less than those of the younger group during the rest period. Thus, we here substantiated the lower role of DMN in elderly people, indicating dynamic analysis's benefit. \n\n### 4.1. The correlation between dynamic features and mnemonic discrimination ability \n  \nMnemonic discrimination ability (MDA) is the perception ability of humans to distinguish existing memories from current inputs by retrieving and encoding past events or experiences. Studies have shown that the decrease in MDA is a sign of neurodegenerative diseases relative to aging. Many pieces of evidence show that as age increases, the MDA will significantly decline (Stark et al.,  ,  ; Wahlheim et al.,  ). However, whether the relationship is linear or not is not clear. \n\nMDA is usually measured by the lure discrimination index (LDI), calculated as the difference in similar responses to lures and foils in the mnemonic discrimination task (Stark et al.,  ). Previous studies have demonstrated the DMN network has an age-inducted abnormal connectivity (Raichle,  ; Nash et al.,  ), and this connectivity abnormality can develop a positive prediction model for LDI (Wahlheim et al.,  ). Nevertheless, this prediction is based on the static connectivity strength, the dynamic characteristics of DMN, or broadly, the function sub-networks, have not been thoroughly investigated. Hence, with the LDI provided by the original data source, this section additionally investigates the correlation between age, the dynamic feature, and MDA. \n\nFirstly, age was observed to be negatively correlated with LDI (  r   = −0.3890,   p   = 0.001), which is consistent with the previous findings (Reagh et al.,  ). In terms of dynamic state features, the fraction time of state 2 is positively correlated with LDI (  r   = 0.3270,   p   = 0.0094), and the fraction time of state 3 is negatively correlated with LDI(  r   = −0.3882,   p   = 0.0018). Similar to fraction time, the MDT of states 2 and 3 has a significant correlation with LDI, where the correlation is   r   = 0.3145 (  p   = 0.0127) and   r   = −0.3591 (  p   = 0.0041), respectively. There is no significant correlation between the number of transitions and LDI or between transition probability and LDI. Recall that the connectivity pattern of state 3 is both weakly connected. This finding implies that the transient weakly connected state impacts the ability of everyday people to distinguish objects. We speculate the aging brain regulates the fraction of the weak state and its dwell time to determine the perceptive ability. In the weak state, the ability of different brain regions to communicate and coordinate with one another is reduced. As age increases, the brain cannot afford the active connectivity state and prefer a “standby” or “sleep” mode, thus lowering the perceptive function. In addition, cognitive and perceptual changes may be interrelated since they are both susceptible to age-related factors, meaning that a reduction in the functioning of the perceptual system may have an impact on cognitive abilities. Hence, it is possible to speculate that the common finding of cognitive decline in the aging brain could be closely related to the weak state of the brain. However, further experiments are necessary to confirm these speculations and explore the relationship between DFNC differences and health and cognitive function during aging. In addition, compared with state 3, state 2 has obvious positive connectivity within the DMN network, especially between the right angular gyrus and the anterior cingulum, suggesting that the transient state with positive connectivity in the DMN domain may promote the increase of MDA. In fact, previous studies have reported that connections positively related to mnemonic discrimination are broadly distributed across prefrontal, temporal, and parietal regions (Huijbers et al.,  ; Sestieri et al.,  ; Kim,  ). Thus, we subsequently investigate the correlation between the nodal-level graph measure of DMN and LDI to hopefully extend our understanding of the DMN network's role in MDA. \n\nThe results show that only the node betweenness of DMN was observed with a weakly positive correlation (  r   = 0.2644,   p   = 0.03780) among the three nodal graph measures. According to the definition of nodal betweenness, this finding implies that the more information transfer passes through the DMN functional region, the more MDA. Besides, recall the highly negative relationship between DMN nodal betweenness and age. One possible and reasonable reason for the older adults' MDA being significantly lower than younger ones is that the aging process mitigates DMN participation gradually, thus inducing the decrease in the MDA. However, it may involve a complicated process. To substantiate this implication, more detailed experiments that target the brain DMN function domain are needed. \n\n\n### 4.2. Dynamic balance of functional integration and segregation in healthy aging \n  \nThe brain system keeps normal functions by maintaining the balance of functional integration (of different functional regions' information transmission for function response) and segregation (specialized information processing within the isolated functional regions). In many diseases with psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, the disrupted balance between segregation and integration within the brain functional network has been demonstrated (Wang et al.,  ; Duan et al.,  ). Previous studies in human aging also revealed the abnormal integration and segregation within the brain function system: the decreased segregation occurs in the healthy aging process (Chan et al.,  ; Wig,  ). Usually, the balance between integration and segregation can be quantified with small-worldness, a graph measure based on the trade-off between high local clustering and short path length (Humphries and Gurney,  ). This network-level metric measures a graph with many local connections and a few random distance connections. Below, we calculate the dynamic small-worldness to investigate the time-varying balance of integration and segregation. \n\nFirstly, the 2-way ANVOA result shows that age has no significant effects on the small-worldness measure (  F   = 2.18,   p   = 0.14), even though this measure is different between transient states. It suggests that the small-world network has not functionally changed as one ages. From the time-varying curve of small-worldness across the entire rest period, we can see that the small-worldness of both young people and the elderly has no clear boundaries. Most of the time, two curves are interwoven together. No one is always higher or lower than another. Besides, the two small-worldness curves are not smooth during the entire rest period. They have large fluctuations, with many spikes. What the spikes mean for the people's behaviors or if their characteristics, like the number of spikes and the energy, cause the age difference has not been clear. However, the measured value always fluctuates around 1 as time goes by, which means that both younger and older people keep a dynamic balance of functional integration and segregation. \n\nSubsequently, from other graph metrics, we may have some clues to the changed functional integration and segregation in elderly people. As a spatially isolated functional specialization, segregation has multiple ways to be quantified. For example, previous studies have quantified segregation with the relationship connectivity strength within and between the modules (Chan et al.,  ; Wig,  ; Bonkhoff et al.,  ). Hence, segregation is often connected with brain modularity. The higher the value of modularity, the more segregation in functional domains. Recall the modularity measure curves in  . The elderly's modularity is nearly always lower than the young, which perhaps implies more functional segregation in senior group people. However, a prior study in a long-term observation has demonstrated that the modularity and segregation might follow a U-shaped curve (Duncan and Small,  ). Thus, the simple linear relationship between modularity and segregation in terms of age may not be true, and more evidence is needed to support that. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nAging has a profound influence on brain functional connectivity. This paper employed the DFNC method to explore the altered dynamic brain function interaction using the resting fMRI scans. Compared with static approach, the DNFC can capture the transient brain state in the elderly as well as young adults. The statistical analysis shows that the state-related features are significantly different between senior adults aged 60–80 and younger adults aged 18–30. In addition, DFNC exhibits the graph topology change spanning the entire scan, suggesting that growing age will induce an alteration in the information transformation efficiency, the robustness of the brain function network, and the dynamic balance of brain integration and segregation. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates that the time fraction of a transient stage could assist in brain age prediction due to the essential clues it carries (with the highest accuracy of 0.88). Overall, using a DFNC approach allows new insights into the systems-level effects that brain aging has on dynamic neural interaction, highlighting that the human brain tends to form differential function coupling patterns with aging. In future work, this function pattern alteration would be promising to help us interpret the relationship between aging and elderly-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or stroke. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nPublicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.

Among these, lesion size, corticospinal-tract lesion-load (CST-LL) and resting-state functional-connectivity (rs-FC) have been correlated with impairment. It has been shown that the sensory cortex (S1) is associated with motor learning and is essential for post-stroke recovery; yet stroke-induced changes in S1 connectivity alone are yet to be investigated. We aim to determine whether interhemispheric rs-FC could be used to refine imaging models of stroke-related impairment. Subjects’ post-stroke and age-matched controls underwent rs-fMRI. Stroke-related disability was correlated with lesion size, CST-LL and interhemispheric S1 and M1 rs-FC as independent seeds. Regression analyses were performed to assess the contribution of these markers in stroke-related deficits. Post-stroke subjects showed an asymmetrical pattern of rs-FC in which affected hemisphere S1 and M1 were mostly connected with ipsi-lesional regions. Correlations between rs-FC and stroke-severity were found. Adding rs-FC of S1 to the regression model of impairment decreased the variance 31% compared to lesion size only. After a stroke, S1 interhemispheric connectivity is decreased, with S1 only connected with ipsi-lesional regions. This asymmetry correlates with neurological and motor impairment. Furthermore, when combined with lesion anatomical measures, S1 connectivity might be an important marker in explaining stroke outcome. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDespite recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease, stroke remains the leading cause of adult impairment worldwide . Identifying a way to accurately determine post-stroke outcome is crucial to achieve the best results in rehabilitation. Neuroimaging techniques have been used to study anatomical and functional markers with respect to neurological and motor impairment. Results of anatomical imaging studies suggest that both lesion size and corticospinal tract lesion load (CST-LL, i.e., overlap of the lesion with the CST) correlate with post-stroke neurological , upper-  and lower-limb  motor deficit. \n\nAnatomical markers indicate the extent of damage caused by stroke but do not however, provide key information on the amount of cerebral reorganization that can take place in intact and peri-infarct tissue  that may significantly impact behavioral outcome. In fact, it has been shown that regions distant to the infarct play an important role in post-stroke neuroplasticity and functional recovery . \n\nFunctional markers such as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) allow for the assessment of whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) at rest by measuring spontaneous modulation in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal without any task, providing a measure of temporal correlation of blood oxygenation fluctuations between brain regions  as a surrogate marker of synchronized neuronal activity at rest. Although typically unilateral, stroke induces interhemispheric changes. Not only does it reduce activity in the affected hemisphere but causes, via transcallosal inhibitory fibers, a release of activity in the unaffected hemisphere (transcallosal disinhibition). In patients with stroke, this increased activity in the non-lesioned hemisphere has repeatedly been demonstrated  and this lack of inhibition from the lesioned hemisphere likely interferes with recovery . Consequently, studies in chronic stroke combining anatomical and rs-FC of interhemispheric connectivity found that patients with less interhemispheric M1 rs-FC and lower fractional anisotropy are more impaired . \n\nMeasures of FC might therefore be good candidates to further define behavioral outcomes post-stroke, in addition to anatomical markers. Most studies have focused on connectivity of the motor cortex region ; however, changes in FC in other regions may provide additional information on cerebral reorganization. For instance, changes in somatosensory cortex activity  and sensory networks  are known to accompany motor learning therefore, integrity of sensory cortex connectivity might be an important marker of motor function post-stroke. Rs-FC of the sensorimotor cortex (M1 and S1 together) have shown similar results as the motor cortex alone, namely that interhemispheric asymmetry is reduced with chronicity and that it correlates with motor impairment . It remains unclear however, what the contribution of the rs-FC of the primary sensory cortex (S1) alone to neurological or motor impairment really is. \n\nThe purpose of the present study is thus to identify stroke-induced changes in rs-FC of the primary sensory cortex (S1). In contrast to previous studies, we extended our analysis to identify inter and intra-hemispheric connectivity independently to both M1 and S1 regions on both affected and non-affected hemispheres. In the same participants, we also assessed lesion size and CST-LL to determine if changes in interhemispheric rs-FC could, added with anatomical markers, better describe neurological and/or motor impairment post-stroke. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Rs-FC in healthy controls \n  \nPositioning the seed on either dominant or non-dominant S1 showed both intra- and inter-hemispheric rs-FC between bilateral S1, occipital and premotor cortices (Fig.  , top). In addition, parietal areas were also connected bilaterally, however, S1-parietal connectivity was mostly intra-hemispheric (BA5 and 7) when the seed was positioned over the non-dominant hemisphere. S1 connectivity was intra-hemispheric for the somatosensory areas (BA40 and 43) but also inter-hemispheric when the seed was positioned on the dominant side (BA40) only.   \nrs-FC in relation to S1-seed. Top panel shows control group and bottom panel shows post-stroke group connectivity maps when the seed is positioned over S1. \n  \n\nPositioning the seed over the dominant or non-dominant M1 in healthy controls revealed a symmetrical pattern of interhemispheric rs-FC in homotopic regions of the pre- and post-central gyri, parietal and occipital lobes (Table   and Fig.  , top). Specifically, the seed was functionally connected to itself and to interhemispheric homologous region. There was intra-hemispheric connectivity of the M1-seed with ipsilateral parietal operculum in addition to inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity observed with the sensory, parietal and occipital cortices. M1 intra-hemispheric, not inter-hemispheric connectivity was observed with the secondary somatosensory area (BA43).   \nClusters of significantly increased rs-FC in relation to each seed. \n  \nR: Right; L: Left; S: subcortical; C: cortical; MCA: Middle Cerebral Artery; *Stroke size also represents the volume excluded for the resting-state analysis.

Top panel shows control group and bottom panel shows post-stroke group connectivity maps when the seed is positioned over M1. \n  \n\n\n### Rs-FC changes post-stroke \n  \nIn subjects post-stroke, the pattern of interhemispheric rs-FC was asymmetrical. Using S1 as seed in stroke revealed the loss of most of the interhemispheric connectivity between the seed region and contra-lesional S1 (BA2 only; Fig.  , bottom-left). The seed instead remained connected intra-hemispherically with itself. S1 connectivity with somatosensory areas was intra-hemispheric and only inter-hemispheric when the seed was on the non-affected S1. The S1-parietal connectivity was purely intra-hemispheric, in contrast with controls who did show inter-hemispheric connectivity between S1 and parietal areas. There was rs-FC between the S1 seed positioned over the affected or non-affected side with the premotor cortex, similar to controls however, the inter-hemispheric connectivity between affected S1 and contra-lesional premotor cortex was not present anymore. When the affected M1 was used as the seed region (Fig.  , bottom-left), most of the sensory regions connected to the affected M1 were only intra-hemispheric (Table  , Seed location A M1). M1 connectivity was only intra-hemispheric and on the affected side only (BA40). Furthermore, the interhemispheric M1-parietal connectivity observed in controls was not observed. Instead, M1-parietal connectivity was only present within the affected hemisphere (BA5 and 7). When the non-affected hemisphere was used as the seed region, a similar pattern was observed where connectivity between M1 (seed) and the parietal regions remained mainly within the non-affected hemisphere, where the seed was positioned. Connection of either S1 or M1 to the visual cortex was lost post-stroke. \n\n\n### Anatomical and function markers in relation to stroke severity \n  \nStroke-related neurological deficit, as measured with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, strongly and significantly correlated with measures of laterality quantified by a laterality index (LI) of rs-FC with the affected S1 or M1 as the seed. It also correlated with the weighted CST-LL (  w  CST-LL) and lesion size, as shown in Table  . Upper-limb impairment quantified by the Chedoke-McMaster arm and hand components also strongly and significantly correlated with LI of rs-FC with the affected S1 or M1 as seed,   w  CST-LL, and lesion size. For the lower-limb, only lesion size correlated strongly, but not significantly, with the Chedoke-McMaster foot and leg components. Weaker correlations were found for the foot component and rs-FC LI when the affected S1 or M1 were used as seeds, and wCST-LL. No correlations were found with the leg component.   \nAnatomical and functional correlations with neurological deficit and motor impairment. \n  \nBold type indicates large correlation (r > 0.6 or <−0.6). \n\nSignificant correlations,   p   < 0.05. \n\nTo assess neurological deficit. \n\nTo assess motor impairment. \n  \n\nTo further evaluate the added value of rs-FC in determining post-stroke impairment, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed. The lesion size, as the anatomical marker, was entered in the first block of the regression as it best correlated with NIHSS and all components of the Chedoke-McMaster than wCST-LL. For the second block, LI rs-FC with affected S1 as the seed was entered as the FC marker. LI rs-FC with affected S1 seed was selected for the model over LI rs-FC with M1 as both are highly and statistically correlated with each other (  r   = 0.852,   p   = 0.007) and with the NIHSS score. A very low level of multicollinearity was present (variance inflation factor <5 for all independent outcomes). Results of the hierarchical regression analysis with NIHSS as the dependent variable showed a significant regression equation with the lesion size explaining 66.1% of the variance (F = 11.69,   p   = 0.014). Adding the FC variable in the second block of the regression significantly improved the relationship (R  change = 0.308 F = 79.028,   p   = 0.000), explaining 96.9% of the variance. \n\nResults of the second hierarchical regression analysis with stroke impairment, as measured by the Chedoke-McMaster, showed that lesion size was a significant factor of arm (86%,   p   = 0.001), hand (60.3%,   p   = 0.023) and foot (68.5%,   p   = 0.022) impairment but not leg. The addition of LI rs-FC with the S1 seed in the second block increased arm (R  change = 0.103, F = 76.55, p = 0.000) from 86% to 96.8% and hand impairment regression (R  change = 0.268. F = 16.855,   p   = 0.006) from 60.3% to 87.1% and had no effect on the other components. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study shows that after stroke there is a disruption of interhemispheric rs-FC between sensory areas. In contrast with previous studies that focused mainly on M1 alone or combined with S1 connectivity, we extended our analysis to identify inter and intrahemispheric connectivity to S1 and M1 regions separately. Our results suggest that after a stroke, there is a significant loss of S1 interhemispheric connectivity. Furthermore, S1 showed increased intra-hemispheric connectivity (mainly with premotor and parietal regions). Our results also demonstrate that after stroke a decreased connectivity between sensorimotor regions and the occipital cortex is present. Additionally, we showed that rs-FC between the primary sensory region may, when combined with anatomical measures of stroke lesion, be an important marker in describing stroke outcome. Moreover, lower-limb impairments are more difficult to describe in contrast to upper-limb impairment and overall neurological deficit. \n\nThe symmetrical interhemispheric rs-FC observed in control subjects resembles the sensorimotor network  involving the precentral, postcentral gyrus and supplementary motor areas. As with other studies, we observed that the affected hemisphere S1 or M1 was mostly connected within that same hemisphere primary somatosensory regions . Our findings support those that showed that a bilateral and symmetrical connectivity between hemispheres is crucial to achieve normal motor performance. In the current study, decreased rs-FC between ipsi-lesional S1 or M1 and contra-lesional sensorimotor areas and parietal region was demonstrated post-stroke. On the other hand, increased intra-hemispheric connectivity between sensorimotor areas and parietal cortex was observed. Instead, functional connectivity of either S1 or M1 with the occipital cortex was lost in stroke patients. These findings coincide with previous studies that reported changes in connectivity of the ipsi-lesional M1 with non-primary sensorimotor regions, such as the fronto-parietal cortex , middle frontal gyrus, thalamus, cerebellum and non-motor brain areas such as the occipital cortex . Our findings suggest that disruption of the symmetrical interhemispheric rs-FC may lead to changes in connectivity of ipsi-lesional brain regions to compensate for the loss of interhemispheric connection. \n\nIn contrast to previous studies, we additionally examined interhemispheric rs-FC when positioning the seed over the non-affected hemisphere S1 or M1 demonstrating a symmetrical and bilateral pattern of rs-FC. These results indicate that connectivity between homologous brain regions is not reciprocal but is rather lesion-dependent. This could be explained by the transcallosal disinhibition hypothesis, which proposes that after a stroke, cortical excitability is decreased due to the infarct in the affected hemisphere, therefore the affected hemisphere can no longer exerts its normal inhibitory influence on the non-affected hemisphere , and/or the non-affected hemisphere exerts too much influence over the already affected one . Thus, stroke can affect regions distant to the infarct compromising the functional network involved in sensorimotor performance and changes in inter and intra-hemispheric rs-FC of the sensorimotor network which might reflect changes in response to post-stroke damage. \n\nUpper-limb motor performance has been correlated with interhemispheric rs-FC between sensorimotor regions as measured with the upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer  assessment and Action Research Arm Test score . In addition,   w  CST-LL and lesion size have also shown correlations with upper-limb motor impairment as assessed by the NIHSS arm motor score  and UE-FM . In our sample, both wCST-LL and lesion size were good markers of upper-limb impairment. Lesion size has been known to correlate with motor and neurological impairment  while CST damage has been shown to contribute mostly to upper-limb impairment in patients with subcortical infarct , but not in those with combined cortical and subcortical lesions . Thus, the stronger correlations observed in our sample with lesion size is likely attributable to the presence of both upper and lower limb deficits as well as both cortical and subcortical infarcts. The addition of rs-FC when the seed was positioned over the affected S1 further decreased the variance of the model by 31% for the upper-limb impairment. However, the current analysis showed that neither anatomical markers (wCST-LL or lesion size) were good indicators of lower-limb impairment. Adding a functional marker did not improve the relationship. Recent studies have demonstrated that post-stroke patients were able to walk even after damage of the CST suggesting that lower-limb performance is dependent on other brainstem tracts such as the reticulospinal-tract , vestibulospinal-tract, rubrospinal-tract and projections from the contralesional cortex  which might play a major role in lower-limb impairment or spinal motor programs may play and additional role. Thus, lower-limb impairment should be considered differently than the upper-limb when evaluating potential for functional recovery. Findings in our study suggest that   w  CST-LL is a unique imaging surrogate marker only for upper-limb post-stroke motor outcome. Lower-limb impairments are more difficult to model –based on the integrity of a single tract– compared to upper-limb impairment and overall neurological deficit. \n\nDespite its novel results, our relatively small number of subjects requires more investigation to generalize our results and to assess whether data from the acute state could predict outcome earlier in the recovery. The seeds and masks were generated using the Jülich atlas, therefore creating reproducible masks in MNI space that are 90% inclusive for both S1 and M1. Because these masks include neurons that cross the theoretical boundaries of a given area, there exists an unavoidable overlap between masks. Although we observe a difference between S1 and M1 connectivity, suggesting that the differences we observe are region specific, a residual uncertainty as to localization remains, which is inherent to cytoarchitectonic probability maps. Functional connectivity studies have been conducted in stroke yet, the changes in tissue composition at the site of the lesion is at various stages of necrosis and gliosis, affecting the BOLD signal . Although we focused our analysis in regions remote to the infarct, it cannot be excluded that the change in tissue composition might have an effect on functional connectivity. In addition, it cannot be excluded that the difference in echo-planar imaging resolution might be an additional source of variability in our group comparisons. Adding longitudinal data would further help determine the predictive value of rs-FC markers for motor impairment. \n\nOur results demonstrate that stroke can affect the functional connectivity of regions distant to the infarct, specifically S1, potentially further compromising motor performance. In addition, we showed that asymmetry in primary sensory rs-FC, when combined with anatomical measures of stroke lesion size, can be an important marker defining post-stroke outcome. Determining the amount of impairment and especially potential for recovery, as suggested by the amount of S1 symmetry, could potentially contribute to the optimization of clinical decisions and treatment post-stroke. This study highlights the important contribution of neuroimaging techniques may play to understand the brain’s reorganization after a stroke. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nEight subjects (mean age: 67 SD 8 years; 5 males, Table  ) in the early chronic phase (>3 months) after a first ischemic cortical or subcortical stroke resulting in upper or lower-limb motor impairment (Chedoke-McMaster  <7), and eight healthy age-matched subjects (mean age: 67 SD 9 years; 5 males) participated in this study. Healthy subjects were recruited from the community and had no history of other neurological, cardiovascular or psychiatric diseases. Handedness was assessed with the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. All participants had scores >0.75 or <−0.75, hence no mixed dominance (1 control was left handed). Prior to their participation, all subjects gave their informed consent to this study that was approved by the McGill Faculty of Medicine Institutional Review Board regulations for human subjects’ studies. All methods were carried out in accordance with approved institutional guidelines and regulations.   \nStroke patient characteristics. \n  \nR: Right; L: Left; S: subcortical; C: cortical; MCA: Middle Cerebral Artery; *Stroke size also represents the volume excluded for the resting-state analysis.

Subjects were instructed to relax and keep their eyes open without focusing on any particular mental activity. T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired (TE = 2.98 ms; TR = 2300 ms, flip angle = 9°, 192 slices, 1 mm  isotropic), followed by the acquisition of a 5-minute sequence BOLD echoplanar images (TE = 30 ms, TR = 2.3 s, 38 slices, 3.5 mm isotropic for S3, S4, S8 and all age-matched subjects and TE = 30 ms, TR = 1.81 s, 34 slices, 4 mm isotropic for S1, S2, S5 and S7). S6 was acquired on a 1.5T Siemens SonataVision Scanner (T1: TE = 9.2 ms; TR = 22 ms; flip angle = 30°, 176 slices, 1 mm  isotropic and BOLD TE = 50 ms, TR = 2.03 s, 24 slices, 4 mm isotropic). \n\n\n### MRI Analysis \n  \n#### Lesion \n  \nPrior to the analysis, images of the left handed control and patients who had left hemisphere lesions were mirrored along the Z-plane so that all dominant hemispheres and all lesions would be on the same side for each group. Stroke lesions were manually outlined in each subject T1-weighted image (Fig.  ). Final infarct segmentation was independently reviewed by a stroke neurologist (AT) and segmentation was adjusted if necessary. To avoid the presence of artifacts due to the loss of neural activity at the tissue of the infarction, voxels identified as part of the stroke volume were excluded from the resting-state analysis.   \nLesion location. (  A  ) Affected; NA: Non-affected. Location of the lesion superimposed in each individual T1-weighted image. The slice with the largest lesion size is presented. \n  \n\n\n#### Lesion Load \n  \nTo assess damage to the WM fibers forming the CST, a lesion load (LL) of the affected hemisphere CST was calculated. The overlap volume of the lesion with a probabilistic CST from the Jülich atlas  was computed according to the   w  CST-LL method . The probabilistic CST was linearly transformed into each individual’s native MRI space. For each subject, a weighting factor was obtained from the probability of each voxel in each lesion slice intersecting with the probabilistic CST. Then, the   w  CST-LL was calculated according to the following equation ( ). where   n   is the total number of intersecting voxels between the lesion volume and fiber tract and I(  n  ) is the probability of the   n   voxel (as represented in the probabilistic tract). \n\n\n\n### Resting-State image preprocessing \n  \nData analysis was performed using a resting-state pipeline developed by the Center for Research on Brain, Language and Music ( ) relying on FSL 5.0.8 (FMRIB Software Library, Oxford, UK)  and Matlab software ( ). Image preprocessing consisted of: (1) Discarding the first 5 volumes in each scan series to allow steady-state imaging, (2) slice-time correction (using Fourier-space time-series phase shifting), (3) brain extraction using FSL Brain Extraction Tool , (4) motion correction, using a 6-parameter affine transformation built-in in FLIRT (FMRIB Linear Image Registration Tool) , (5) global intensity normalization, (6) spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 6 mm (7) temporal high-pass filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-square straight-line fitting with σ = 100.0 s). Two transformations were performed: (1) from functional image to T1-weighted anatomical image (using a 7-Degrees of Freedom (DOF) transformation), (2) from MRI native to MNI space (using a 12-DOF linear affine transformation; voxel size 2 × 2 × 2 mm). \n\n\n### Seed masks \n  \nA seed-based connectivity analysis was used to identify voxels temporally correlated with BOLD signal fluctuations with bilateral M1 or S1. Masks were created in MNI space using a combination of the probabilistic Jüelich atlas  BA4a and BA4p for M1 and BA1, BA2, BA3a and BA3b for S1 (Fig.  ). The Jülich atlas is a cytoarchitectonic probability map, which includes S1 or M1 neurons that lay outside the typical Brodmann area boundaries. The resulting masks were thresholded at a voxel probability of 10% (ensuring that most voxels associated with the ROI were included), binarized, and linearly transformed into MNI space. The resulting M1 seed thus included 99% of BA4a and BA4p on both right and left sides but also intersected with BA6 (36% left and 38% right) and BA3b (81% left and 60% right). The resulting S1 seed comprised 99% of BA3b on the left and 98% on the right, 96% of BA2 on the left and 93% right, 92% of BA1 on the left and 97% on the right, but also overlapped with BA4a (63% left and 66% right). We accepted this overlap with adjacent regions because we wanted to ensure that >90% of the target region was used as seed.   \nSchematic representation of the seed regions. Seeds were created using a combination of the probabilistic Jüelich atlas. \n  \n\n\n### Resting-state FC map computation \n  \nThe BOLD signal from the preprocessing step was entered in a regression analysis, using a general linear model with the seed region time-series and the nuisance variables time-series as dependent variables, with FEAT (FMRIB Expert Analysis Tool) . Physiological noise removal improves the results of the FC analysis at rest, therefore, the time-series for nuisance variables was calculated and excluded from the analysis as follows: first, the time series for Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), WM, and grey matter (GM) were extracted. The resulting segmented CSF, WM and GM images were thresholded (ensuring 80% tissue type probability) and transformed into functional space. The mean time-series was calculated by averaging the times-series from all voxels within the seed region. A total of nine nuisance regressors were used: CSF, WM, global signal, and six motion parameters (  x  ,   y  , and   z   translations and rotations obtained from the motion-correction step). Relative motion was similar between groups (stroke: 0.06 SD 0.03 mm vs. controls 0.07 SD 0.05 mm, t = −0.457, p = 0.654). For each individual, a separate multiple regression analysis was performed on the time-series of the nuisance signal using FEAT. This way, the nuisance signals are removed and the residual image represents the temporal correlation of the corrected BOLD signal in the seed region with each voxels forming rs-FC maps with cluster thresholding at   Z   > 2.3,   p   = 0.05 corrected using a Gaussian Random Field (GRF) theory. \n\n\n### Lateralization Index \n  \nTo quantify changes in inter-hemispheric FC, a LI was calculated. All voxels functionally connected to M1 on each hemisphere were calculated as a mean difference ratio for the seed positioned over the affected M1. The same procedure was repeated for the seed position over the affected S1 but for the mean difference ratio of bilateral S1. The same masks used to generate the seed region were used to calculate LI: (ΣFC  − ΣFC )/(ΣFC  + ΣFC ) where ΣFC  denotes the number of voxels functionally connected to the seed inside the affected (patients) or dominant (controls) sensory or motor area (intrahemispheric connectivity) and ΣFC  is the number of voxels functionally connected to the seed inside the non-affected/non-dominant hemisphere (interhemispheric connectivity). LI closer to 1 thus indicates connectivity within the affected (or dominant) hemisphere, i.e., more intra-hemispheric connectivity whereas an LI closer to −1 within the non-affected (or non-dominant), would indicate mainly inter-hemispheric connectivity (i.e., seed to opposite hemisphere, not to itself). Values close to 0 indicate symmetry, where intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity is similar. \n\n\n### Statistical Analyses \n  \n Z  -statistic images from the individual-level analysis were entered into to a group-level analysis GLM using FEAT mixed-effects model with a cluster thresholding   Z   ≥ 3,   p   ≤ 0.05 corrected using a GRF theory. Significant areas connected to the seed and their locations in MNI coordinates were identified. \n\nPearson’s correlation was used to determine whether a subject’s anatomical and functional markers correlated with their NIHSS and Chedoke-McMaster upper and lower-limb scores. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed using   w  CST-LL, lesion size and LI values as independent variables to model post-stroke impairment. \n\n\n### Data availability \n  \nThe datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"e593ff08c18a7aae1d69b19850b955b0"},

Changes in cognitive performance over two years were assessed using the Cognitive Composite Score. The prediction of change in cognitive function was based on changes in pairwise functional connectivity between 80 gray matter regions examined by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. A feature extraction process based on the Variable Importance Testing Approach (VITA) identified changes in 11 pairs of functional connections associated with the default mode network as features related to changes in cognitive performance. Linear and elastic net regression models were applied to these 11 features to predict changes in cognitive performance over two years. A relationship between the 11 features and the geriatric depression score was also shown. The dataset supplements the research findings in the \"Changes in pairwise functional connectivity associated with changes in cognitive performance in cognitively normal older individuals: a two-year observational study\" published in Oishi et al. (2022).

Cognitive performance was evaluated annually using the Cognitive Composite Score (CC). Each participant was assessed a total of at least six times. The mean CC of 92 cognitively normal participants is plotted against the number of visits. The rs-fMRI was scanned at visit 4 (= Time 1) and visit 6 (= Time 2). Mean CC and standard deviation (SD) are shown above the graph. \n  Fig 1     \nWorkflow for extracting features related to changes in cognitive performance from rs-fMRI signals and risk factors for cognitive decline. \n\nUpper row: The process of calculating the change in pairwise functional connectivity between Time 1 and Time 2. For the evaluation of functional connectivity, the correlation matrix of the rs-fMRI data was Fisher's z-transformed and age-corrected (z-cors). The change in functional connectivity (dz-cors) was calculated from the difference in z-cors between Time 1 and Time 2. \n\nMiddle row: A set of variables that may be associated with changes in cognitive performance. \n\nLower row: Evaluation of change in cognitive performance between Time 1 and Time 2 (dCC) and selection of important variables related to dCC. The change in cognitive performance (dCC) was calculated from the difference in CC between Time1 and Time 2. Among 3160 dz-cors, vascular health risk, years of education, sex, and APOE code, important features associated with dCC were selected using VITA. \n  Fig 2     \nScatterplots showing the relationship between measured dCC (y-axis) and dCC predicted by the linear regression model (x-axis). With the variables selected by the procedure detailed in   and sex as inputs, a linear regression model was applied to create a predictive model for dCC. Four-fold cross-validation was used for the validation. That is, the data were randomly divided into four equal-sized subsets (subsets a–d); all samples not included in the selected subset were used as training data, and samples included in the selected subset were used as test data. Predictive model performance was evaluated by coefficient of determination between measured dCC and predicted dCC and the   p  -values, which are embedded in each graph. This data supplements Table 3 in the original publication   to assess the predictive model's performance. \n  Fig 3   \n\n\n## Experimental Design, Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nData of 92 cognitively normal older individuals (52–82 years of age (SD, 6.22 years; male/female = 31/61) were extracted from the Biomarker for Older Controls at Risk for Dementia (BIOCARD) cohort. All participants signed informed consent to complete examinations and evaluate previously obtained blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and brain MRIs. \n\n\n### Clinical Assessments \n  \nThe Clinical Core staff of the Johns Hopkins BIOCARD study team made a consensus diagnoses. First, a syndromic diagnosis of normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia was made. This diagnosis was based on clinical data about medical, neurological, and psychiatric status; reports of cognitive changes by the individual and his or her companion; and cognitive decline based on a review of longitudinal tests in multiple cognitive domains. If cognitive decline was determined to be present, the probable etiology of the syndrome was then determined based on medical, neurological, and psychiatric information collected at each visit and from medical records obtained from the individual. Each individual might have multiple etiologies, such as AD and vascular disease. Vascular health risk factors and APOE gene status were assessed as in the original publication  . \n\n\n### Cognitive Composite Score (CC) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) Score \n  \nThe CC is the mean of the following four cognitive test scores converted to z-scores  . The cognitive tests used were Paired Associates Immediate Recall and Logical Memory Delayed Recall (Story A) from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised  , Boston Naming  , and Digit-Symbol Substitution of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised  . The requirement for measuring cognitive composite scores was the presence of at least two of the four scores at each visit  , and if two or more scores were missing, the CC for that visit was considered missing. The two-year change in cognitive performance (dCC) was obtained from the difference in CC between Time 1 and Time 2 ( ). Depressive symptoms were assessed using GDS   (Min = 0, Max = 15) (results are described in the original publication in  ) ( ).   \nRegression coefficients and the intercept obtained from an elastic net regression model. With the variables selected by the procedure detailed in   and sex as inputs, elastic net regression was applied to generate a predictive model for dCC. Four-fold cross-validation was used for the validation. That is, the data were randomly divided into four equal-sized subsets (subsets 1–4 in  ); all samples not included in the selected subset were used as training data, and samples included in the selected subset were used as test data. Predictive model performance was evaluated by coefficient of determination between measured dCC and predicted dCC and the p-value.

This data supplements Table 3 of the original publication in  , in which the results of a simple linear model are presented instead of the elastic net penalized regression model. \n  Table 1   \n\n\n### MRI Scans \n  \nAn echo-planar imaging sequence was used to acquire rs-fMRI data consisting of 140 functional volumes. The total scan duration for each session was 420 s. Forty-Eight axial slices were obtained to cover the whole brain. The field of view (FOV) was 2.12 × 2.12 cm ; the voxel size was 3.3 × 3.3 × 3.3 mm ; the repetition time (TR) was 3000 ms; the echo time (TE) was 30 ms; the flip angle was 75°. For the anatomical reference, magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) scans were acquired. There were 170 sagittal slices that covered the whole brain. The FOV was 240 × 256 mm ; the TR was 6.8 ms; the TE was 3.1 ms; the shot interval was 3000 ms; the flip angle was 8°; the voxel size was 1 × 1 × 1.2 mm ; and the scan duration was 5 min 59 s. \n\n\n### Image Processing \n  \nrs-fMRI images were automatically post-processed, segmented, and qualified in MRICloud ( ). The multi-atlas label fusion approach was applied to parcellate the MPRAGE image into 283 anatomical structures that included 80 gray matter structures used in this study  . The JHU multi-atlas library   version 9, containing 30 atlases covering an age-range of 50–90 years, was adopted as the reference library. The label fusion step was performed based on  , adjusted by the PICSL algorithm  . The MPRAGE and corresponding parcellation map were co-registered to the motion and slice timing-corrected EPI  , and the time course of the BOLD signal was extracted from the 72 cortical (including the hippocampus) and eight sub-cortical gray matter regions   .   \nCorrelation between change in functional connectivity (dz-cors, see  ) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).

The areas involved in the default mode network are boxed; the salient network is underlined; and the lateral prefrontal areas are double underlined. This dataset was supplementary to the original publication in  . \n  Table 2   \n\n\n### rs-fMRI Analysis and Feature Selection \n  \nThe correlation matrix among structures was obtained from processed rs-fMRI images. Fisher's z-transformed correlation was used as functional connectivity (z-cor). z-cors were age-corrected  . The two-year changes in functional connectivity (dz-cors) were obtained from the differences of z-cors between Time 1 and Time 2. Featured variables related to dCC were assessed using VITA   with a cross-validated permutation variable importance measure (CVPVI) from 3164 variables, including 3160 dz-cors and risk factors (sex, vascular health risk, years of education, and APOE gene status) at Time 1 (detailed in the original publication in  ) ( ). \n\n\n### Prediction Modeling \n  \nAfter feature selection using VITA, we applied the generalized model to build the prediction model with selected functional connections as variables for a change in cognition. We used four-fold cross-validation for the evaluation of the model, in which the data set was split into training data (  n   = 69) and test data (  n   = 23). The kWayStratifiedY function in the vtreat package in R (v.4.0.2) was used to introduce a stratified sampling to address the internal structure imbalance problem of the data splitting. Namely, it allows the splitting of data to maintain the internal distribution of dCC in the original data. The glmnet for elastic net regression   in the classification and regression training (caret) package in R (v.4.0.2) was used. Model fitting for regression coefficients was performed with ten-fold cross-validation in all four subsets of training data. Each model was applied to each subset of the test dataset to obtain the predicted dCC. The model performance for the prediction of the dCC was evaluated by the correlation analysis between the measured dCC and the output of the model (predicted dCC) obtained from four subsets of the test data. The correlation between the measured and predicted dCC was calculated using Pearson's product-moment correlation in R (v.4.0.2). The regression coefficients obtained from each of the four models and the   p  -values were demonstrated (  and  ).   \nScatterplots showing the relationship between measured dCC (y-axis) and dCC predicted by the elastic net penalized model (x-axis). The (a–d) represent the results of subset 1, subset 2, subset 3, and subset 4 described in  . Correlation and   p  -values are embedded in each graph. This data supplements Table 3 in the original publication   to assess the predictive model's performance. \n  Fig 4   \n\n\n### Correlation Between Functional Connectivity and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) Score \n  \nGDS score at baseline (Time 1) was assessed in the correlation analysis with the dz-cor of featured functional connections ( ).

A possible explanation is that women have a trait tendency to engage in a ruminative response style. Depending on cognitive model of depression, attention bias, memory bias and self-referential bias were closely related among depressed patients. Previous studies have explored the neural mechanism of the cognitive biases by using amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) or functional connectivity (FC), and few combined these two metrics, especially focusing on female patients. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe assessed 25 female patients diagnosed with MDD and 13 well matched healthy controls (HCs) using Rs-fMRI. Two metrics ALFF and FC based on abnormal ALFF were explored and made comparisons. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared with HCs, female patients with MDD showed that one cluster with significantly decreased ALFF in the left middle occipital gyrus(L-MOG). Furtherly we founded depressed female subjects showed significantly lower FC between the L-MOG seed and left orbitofrontal cortex, and significantly higher FC between the L-MOG seed and left medial prefrontal gyrus and left hippocampus. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur results showed L-MOG may act as a connection, which involved in the processing of cognitive biases of MDD by connected with limbic-cortical regions in resting state. These findings may enhance the understanding of the neurobiological mechanism in female patients with MDD. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a very common heterogeneous mental disorder characterized by depressed affective and cognitive disturbances, especially for women, with an incidence and prevalence twice that of men [ ]. An availably possible explanation is that women have a trait tendency to engage in a ruminative response style characterized by a repetitive pattern of self-referent cognitions [ ]. Some studies furtherly posited that rumination is clearly related to attentional bias. Review found that participants who primarily respond to a negative mood by ruminating showed difficulty disengaging from negative material even after controlling for depression severity [ ]. Researchers consider that female’s tendency to habitually ruminate in response to a negative mood suggests that gender will evidence greater attentional biases for negative information, because they will exhibit difficulties inhibiting negative stimuli, and that females may be more vulnerable to attentional manipulations for negative stimuli than males [ ]. \n\nAccording to cognitive model of depression, attention, memory, thoughts and rumination biases are stable abnormalities of depressed patients. Negative bias in the processing of information plays a critical role in influencing the onset, maintenance and recurrence of depressive episodes [ ,  ]. Although the causative link between attention bias and mood disorder is not completely clear, some studies have found that attentional bias modification had been used to reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms [ – ]. A meta-analysis has found reducing negative bias could decrease depressive symptoms and increasing negative bias could increase depressive symptoms [ ]. These findings indicated that attentional bias may contribute directly to depressive symptoms and not a consequence of depression [ ]. Some studies also suggest that attention bias arise prior to the onset of a disorder, representing a risk factor [ – ]. \n\nAttention bias have been reported to be particularly prominent of emotional face, and these findings are all from specific task state studies like identifying emotional face [ ]. Task stimuli help to explore the specific stimuli process, and could not delineate a comprehensive process in common daily life. MDD is a pervasive disorder and has an impact on very realm of daily life. Biased cognitive processes play a crucial role in social function including interpersonal problems. “Resting-state hypothesis” of MDD considered neural predisposition at rest as a fundamental neural mechanism of MDD. So, study using resting state combining with functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI) without any task stimulus also may provide some insight for neural mechanism of pervasive abnormal cognition patterns [ ]. \n\nRs-fMRI has been widely explored in patients with the neuropsychiatric disorder, including MDD. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) is to examine low frequency fluctuation at Rs-fMRI. ALFF is confirmed to be reliable and sensitive measure in the study of both healthy and clinical populations [ – ]. Functional connectivity (FC) measures the correlation of low frequency fluctuation between spatially independent regions. MDD is considered a disease from localist models to the circuit or network models [ – ]. Numbers of studies have provided lots of findings in MDD using these two metrics. Yao and his colleagues found that male MDD patients showed higher ALFF values in the left postcentral gyrus, the left inferior parietal lobule and right precuneus and lower ALFF values in left superior temporal pole, right superior/middle frontal gyrus and bilateral crus 1 of the cerebellum for main effects of gender compared with females [ ]. Buchanan investigated whole brain FC in MDD and found that depressed female patients showed significantly decreased FC in the right/left frontoparietal regions and language networks compared to healthy control subjects [ ]. Another study founded that high-risk female adolescents had decrease FC between right inferior prefrontal cortex and other critical nodes of attention control network compared with low-risk ones, and they concluded that adolescent daughters might inherit depression vulnerability from their depressed patients [ ]. Previous studies have also described sex difference in brain structure and function. Morphometric study in normal adults found that differences of some indices of corpus callosum and ventricles in female and male populations [ ]. Amygdala volumes in adolescents showed sex differences, smaller left amygdala volumes were associated with better parental reports of emotional controls in girls and larger left amygdala volumes in boys [ ]. Using fMRI, McRae explored the gender differences in cognitive reappraisal strategy of emotional regulation, and found women showed larger increases activation in prefrontal regions, smaller decreases activation in the amygdala and larger engagement of ventral striatal regions compared with men [ ]. A recent multimodal meta-analysis identified abnormalities in regional cerebral blood flow and ALFF in the left insula in depressed individuals and founded that the percentage of female participants was negatively associated with the regional cerebral blood flow [ ]. All of these studies showed us that gender factor should be taken into consideration in the study of fMRI. Consequently, study directly focusing on women may help to investigate potentially additional insight into the neural mechanisms in MDD. \n\nDepending on the current most consistent theories of limbic-cortical dysfunction in MDD, MDD is accompanied by functional and structural abnormalities in many regions including the prefrontal cortex (lateral and medial) and limbic areas (such as hippocampus and amygdala) [ ]. Regions in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) [ ,  – ] and hippocampus [ ,  – ] are believed to be the neural correlate of self-referential thoughts, rumination and biased memory, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) [ – ]is believed to involve in the inhibitory control and selective attention. \n\nWe are aware of few studies combining these two methods to examine resting-state differences in depressed female patients directly. Previous studies of FC usually took region of interest selection based on accumulated priori knowledge of disorder. This method has a certain subjectivity and artificial. Thus, combining ALFF and FC based on the abnormal ALFF maybe provide some insights into the neural basis of disease in term of fMRI signal of low-frequency fluctuation. We aimed to test the hypotheses that 1) female MDD would have altered ALFF activity in cortical regions related to attentional bias which acted as a connection and 2) abnormal ALFF-based FC with hippocampus and mPFC which involved in cognitive bias of depression. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThirty-eight subjects participated in the present study. Twenty-five female depressed patients were recruited from the Department of Medical Psychology, Nanjing Brain Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University. Two experienced psychiatrists made a diagnosis of current depressive episode according to the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorder (SCID). The patient must meet the inclusion criteria of the first episode depression, drug-naive, duration of depression less than a year, 20 < age < 50 years old, right-handed and no history of unstable cardiac or neurological disease. The exclusion criteria included schizophrenia, bipolar and any psychotic disorder, history of head injury or loss of consciousness, history of substance abuse, contraindications to MRI and 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score less than 18. \n\nThirteen right-handed aged-matched and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) with HAMD less than 8 were enrolled from the community through advertisements. The HCs group was interviewed by SCID non-patient edition to confirm without any neurological disease, mental illness, or family history of psychiatric disorders, contraindications to MRI. \n\n\n### Data acquisition \n  \nAll Rs-fMRI data were obtained with a 3.0 T Siemens MR scanner (Erlangen, Germany). Before scanning, a foam pad was used to minimize the head motion of all participants. Participants were instructed to keep head motionless, keep their eyes closed and not think anything till the end. Firstly, T1-weighted images were acquired to make sure that there are no brain structural changes. The parameters of three-dimensional T1-weighted sequence: repetition time 1900 ms with echo time 2.48 ms, flip angle 9°, 176 slices, 256*256 image matrix, the field of view 256*256, slice thick 1 mm with slice gap 0.5 mm. Total acquire time is 4 min 18 s. Secondly, Rs-fMRI data were acquired with single shot echo planner imaging (EPI) sequence using the parameters: repetition time 3000 ms with echo time 40 ms, flip angle 90°, 32 slices, 64*64 image matrix, the field of view 24*24 cm2, slice thick 4 mm with slice gap 4 mm. Total scan time is 5 min 06 s. \n\n\n### fMRI data preprocessing \n  \nSpecial fMRI software Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF, v2.2,  ) was used to preprocess Rs-fMRI data. First six volumes were discarded to establish steady-state signal equilibrium and account for participants’ adaptation to circumstance. The remaining volumes were sliced timing and realigned head motion correction. Two HC were excluded due to excessive head motion (more than 1.5 mm or 1.5° during scanning). Furtherly, there was no significant difference between group (two sample   t   test,   t   = 0.625,   P   = 0.536 for translation, and   t   = 0.452,   P   = 0.653 for rotation) based on the formula [ ]. The imaging was then spatially normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) EPI template. Spatial smoothed with 4 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian filter were done. Finally, linear trend subtraction and temporal bandpass filtering (0.01–0.08HZ) were performed to remove low-frequency drifts and physiological noise. \n\n\n### ALFF calculation \n  \nALFF was calculated and compared by the Resting State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST, V1.8,  ). Briefly, the time series was converted to the frequency domain using a fast Fourier Transformation, the square root of measures power spectrum was computed and then the mean was calculated across 0.01–0.08 Hz for each voxel. The mean square root was referred to ALFF. Each voxel was further standardized by divided by the global mean value for subsequent statistical analysis. \n\n\n### FC analysis \n  \nSeed-based FC analysis was also calculated with REST. The clusters of ALFF that appeared in group differences were used as regions of interest for the FC analysis based on literature [ ]. The mean time series of abnormal ALFF region was calculated as the reference time course. Then we conducted a correlation analysis between seed reference time course and the rest voxels in the whole brain. Finally, the correlation coefficients were transformed to z-value by applying Fisher’s r-to-z conversion to improve their Gaussian distribution for subsequent FC group comparisons. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nIndependent sample   t  -test was used to compare demographic and HAMD scores in SPSS. Then we first do one-sample   t  -tests in MDD and HCs group using standardized ALFF that was significantly greater than 1 in RESR to make a mask for subsequent two-sample   t   test for ALFF, because of the processing of standardized by the global mean value. Differences in ALFF were assessed used two- sample   t  -tests with REST within the mask. Differences in FC were also assessed as the same with ALFF within the whole brain mask. In all the analysis, Monte Carlo simulation was applied to correct for multiple comparisons using the REST Alphasim program [ ,  ], and the significance threshold of   p   < 0.05 was set by using a combination of each voxel threshold   p   < 0.05 and cluster size of 42 voxels for ALFF and 85 voxels for FC calculation. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics \n  \nCompared to HCs, there was no significant difference between the two group in terms of age or level of education. As expected, patients with MDD had significantly higher HAMD scores (Table  ).   \nDemographic, clinical characteristics \n  \n Abbreviation  :   HCs   healthy controls,   MDD   major depressive disorder,   HAMD   Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression \n\nThe   P   values were obtained by two sample   t-  test \n  \n\n\n### The ALFF group results of the two group from one sample   t  -tests \n  \nOne sample t-tests reveal that bilateral frontal lobe, bilateral temporal lobe, bilateral parietal lobe, bilateral occipital lobe, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex/ precuneus had a standardized ALFF value that was significantly greater than 1 in the two groups (Fig.  ).   \nMaps of within condition patterns of resting state amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation in group MDD and HCs.

Compared with healthy controls, female major depressive disorder patients show significantly increased FC of left middle occipital gyrus (MOG.L) with left medial prefrontal gyrus (MPG.L) and left hippocampus (Hippo.L) and significantly decreased FC between L-MOG and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC.L) L, Left. The red line refers to higher FC, and the blue line refers to lower FC \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study aimed to explore the neural basis of MDD in first-episode untreated female patients. We combined ALFF with FC analysis methods based on brain coactivation mechanisms among the different regions. Specifically, we sought to examine FC pattern of a region which had abnormal ALFF activation. We found that a unique decreased abnormal activation in L-MOG in depressed female patients. Moreover, significantly increased FC of L-MOG with L-mPFG and left hippocampus, and significantly decreased FC between L-MOG and L-OFC were also showed in depressed female patients. \n\nWe found significantly decrease ALFF in L-MOG which was consistent with our hypothesis. The occipital lobe contains most of the anatomical region of the visual cortex and contributes to visual information processing and communication with the cerebral cortex, and plays a role in the perception of facial emotion. Cerullo noticed that patients with bipolar-I showed decreased activation in the bilateral MOG compared with HC and MDD, while MDD only showed decreased activation in L-MOG compared to bipolar-I patients under the emotional imaging stimulus [ ]. Furey found baseline activation of MOG may predict treatment response to scopolamine [ ]. Many resting state studies and recent meta-analysis of Rs-fMRI also found decreased activation in L-MOG [ – ]. Structural research showed that occipital bending might be characteristic of MDD [ ]. Guo and his colleagues have founded decreased ALFF in occipital cortex and considered it relevant to MDD and implicated disrupted visual processing in MDD [ ]. One study demonstrated the role of MOG in category-selective attention modulating unconscious face/tool processing and found decreased activation in MOG under the face-selective attention during unconscious face processing [ ]. Consistent with these studies, the decreased ALFF in L-MOG may provide a neural basis for disrupted visual processing in female MDD. A common cognitive feature of MDD is mood congruent processing bias that is a preference for negative emotional information [ ,  ]. Some researches considered the model of selective bias in processing and interpretation for emotional information to be one of the risk factors of MDD for young people [ ,  ] and that attention to negative information may maintain depression [ ,  ]. Consequently, our finding may suggest that processing bias in MDD may be initiated as a perceptual visual bias, which may cause a series of cognitive and affective symptoms of MDD. \n\nFurthermore, we found significantly increased FC between L-MOG and L-mPFG and hippocampus. The mPFG and its adjacent areas play a crucial role in depression symptomatology [ ,  ,  ]. It has been confirmed that mPFG was involved in self-referential thought [ ] and depressive rumination [ ,  ]. Yoshimura showed that patients with depression displayed hyperactivity in mPFC during the self-referential processing of negative valence personality trait words [ ] and negative emotional words [ ]. Delaveau also found that antidepressant medicine in females depressed patients could bring the hyperactivity of mPFC during self-referential processing back to normal [ ]. A visual search task study showed increased FC between mPFC and lateral occipital cortex, and observed white matter tracts between mPFC and lateral occipital cortex using imaging-guided diffusion tensor imaging [ ]. In previous resting state studies, we have not found FC between mPFC and occipital cortex. The different findings may be related to differences in samples and medications status [ ]. We speculate that the increase FC between L-MOG and L-mPFG may be related to exaggerated self-referential processing bias and depressive rumination in MDD. \n\nHippocampus is also a vital region in the pathogenesis of MDD [ ,  ]. As a key structure of limbic circuit involved in memory formation, emotional learning and emotional regulation [ ]. In particular, memory biases of negative information rely heavily on it [ ,  ]. An associative and item recognition memory fMRI study showed that association recognition memory for object-color relationship led to bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampus activation and L-MOG, while old item recognition of objects showed activation in L-MOG and L-middle temporal gyrus. New item recognition of objects just showed activation in the bilateral hippocampus [ ]. Emotional memory recollection involved in the hippocampus and mPFC [ ]. Studies showed that sleeping could help to consolidate emotional memory by enhancing the FC between the hippocampus and mPFC [ ] and promote the neural reorganization of remote emotional memory by enhancing the FC between mPFC and precuneus and occipital cortex [ ]. Increasing FC between L-MOG and L-hippocampus in this study may be related to memory impairment and sleep disturbance in MDD. \n\nHippocampus and mPFG are also key nodes of default mode network (DMN) [ ,  ]. Although DMN has been linked to episodic memory and memory consolidation in some studies [ ], a study paid more attention to its function in self-generated thought and rumination during rest, especially in depression [ ]. In this current study, we found increase FC between L-MOG and hippocampus and mPFG may be relevant to bias attention, bias memory and biased thought and rumination in MDD [ ]. \n\nAt last, we found decreased FC between L-MOG and L-OFC. OFC is regarded as a region in integrating sensory and emotional information through white matter connections with visual, auditory and limbic structures [ ], and play a vital role in mood regulation, response inhibition, selective attention and reward processing in the pathophysiology of MDD [ ,  – ]. Previous study revealed decreased ALFF in OFC in patients with MDD and suggested hypofunction of emotion regulation [ ]. Dynamic causal modeling was applied to explored neural mechanisms of a bottom-up and top-down process for emotional facial expression during memory formation. Xiu and his collogues found that emotion information could affect bottom-up connections from the occipital visual cortex to the OFC [ ]. Lateral OFC act an important role in facilitating selective attention to modulate irrelevant emotional materials from the environment [ ]. MDD patients showed increased OFC activity in attentional task asking to ignore sad words with attending to happy ones compared with ignoring happy with attending to sad [ ]. In this sense, decrease FC between L-MOG and L-OFC may indicate impairment inhibited capability in response to visual information and related to dysfunctional mood regulation in female depression. \n\nIt is worth noting that we found left-lateralized cortical regions in female MDD. This finding was also in consistent with previous findings. Jiang has founded that differences in predominated lateralization of ALFF alteration between MDD and bipolar depression which meant left hemisphere for MDD and bilateral of bipolar depression [ ]. Of course, these findings may be related to gender difference. In brain study, sex-related hemisphere lateralization was founded in healthy young Chinese adults. This study suggested that regional difference of gray matter density between men and women, and that functional regional homogeneity (ReHo) difference with higher ReHo in the right hemisphere for men and in left for women [ ]. Our findings were also compatible with previous study. Recently, an event-related potential study suggested that female depression may be more vulnerable that male during emotional face processing with the unconscious negative cognitive bias, and considered that unconscious cognitive bias may be modulated by sex effects [ ]. \n\nSome limitations should be addressed. First, the small number of participants and the imbalance in HCs might be insufficient to summarize the results to a larger population. Second, the data are cross-sectional; we cannot ensure the clinical diagnosis consistency of MDD patients because of the risk of switching to bipolar disorder. Third, although ALFF was used wildly, the true neurophysiological mechanism is still not clear. Future studies should include a larger number of participants with a longer observation period. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn summary, the present study revealed that female subjects with MDD had decreased ALFF in L-MOG and increased FC between L-MOG with L-mPFG, and left hippocampus and decreased FC between L-MOG and L-OFC. Importantly, these findings indicated L-MOG act as a connection, and abnormal FC may be potentially related to cognition biases of MDD and may help to advance our understanding of the neurobiological mechanism underlying female depressed patients. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"2bad471a77e3d8558984a16193298781"},

However, the neurobiological mechanism of depression underlying PD remains unclear. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nThis study was conducted to investigate whether intra-network and inter-network brain connectivity is differently changed in PD patients with and without depression (PDD and PDND patients, respectively). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nForty-one PDD patients, 64 PDND patients, and 55 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), salience network (SN), precuneus network (PCUN), and sensorimotor network (SMN) were extracted using independent component analysis (ICA), and then the functional connectivity (FC) values within and between these networks were measured. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nPDD patients exhibited abnormal FC values within the DMN, ECN, SN, PCUN, and SMN. In addition, PDD patients demonstrated decreased connectivity between anterior SN (aSN) and bilateral ECN, between posterior SN (pSN) and dorsal DMN (dDMN), and between PCUN and dDMN/SMN/bilateral ECN. Connectivity within the left hippocampus of dDMN and the right medial superior frontal gyrus of aSN was a significant predictor of depression level in PD patients. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nAberrant intra- and inter-network FC is involved in several important hubs in the large-scale networks, which can be a biomarker for distinguishing PDD from PDND. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease ( ); it is characterized by a combination of cardinal motor features and non-motor symptoms (NMS), including different prominent psychiatric disturbances ( ). A progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic projections leads to classical motor symptoms in PD ( ). Depression is one of the most common NMSs in PD, and almost half of PD patients have mild to major depressive symptoms ( ). Unfortunately, rarely have studies analyzed the circuit-level degeneration in PD with depression (PDD). \n\nThe recently proposed “triple-network” model emphasized the cooperation among networks. The triple-network model includes the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and salience network (SN) ( ). They are the three most important intrinsic networks of the human brain activation. DMN controls internal thought and autobiographical memory ( ). ECN is involved in multiple cognitive processes, such as attention, language, and memory ( ). SN has both abundant structural connectivity and functional connectivity (FC) with many brain regions of the DMN and ECN ( ;  ), and it is well known for its functions in processing salience information ( ) and regulating balance between different large-scale networks ( ) such as DMN and ECN. Abnormalities in the triple-network model have been observed across several psychiatric disorders including PDD ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, these network abnormalities were found in PD patients from a small cohort. The precuneus network (PCUN) hub consists of the precuneus, posterior inferior parietal lobule, middle cingulate cortex, and dorsal angular gyri. PCUN responds to a wide range of cognitive processes, including self-related processing ( ); reflective, awareness, and conscious information processing ( ); episodic memory ( ); and visuospatial processing ( ). The sensorimotor network (SMN) includes somatosensory (e.g., postcentral gyrus) and motor (e.g., precentral gyrus) regions and extends to the supplementary motor areas. However, the connectivity within these specific networks has not been documented in PDD patients. \n\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) is a novel, non-invasive approach without performing any specific task. Previous RS-fMRI studies in depressed PD patients using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis have demonstrated alterations in regional brain activity in the prefrontal–limbic system, the basal ganglia (BGN), and the DMN ( ;  ;  ;  ). Studies with FC analysis have observed FC disruption in the emotional, limbic, motor, and DMNs in depressed PD patients ( ;  ;  ). However, the networks do not function independently, and investigation of the connectivity within one specific network may not be enough or may be somewhat unjustified. A study using independent component (IC) analysis (ICA) confirmed the involvement of BGN, DMN, left frontoparietal network (LFPN), and SN in depression in PD patients, facilitating the development of more detailed and integrative neural models of PDD ( ). Based on the above studies, we hypothesized that PDD may be related to the damage of specific large-scale neural networks, rather than on the disruption of a single, random, discrete brain region; not only the connectivity within these networks but also the coordination between them can be a prominent feature of PDD. \n\nAlternatively, the ICA is a seed-free approach for detecting connectivity of brain networks. ICA offers an effective means for identification of functional systems within the brain during rest, typically referred to as “resting-state networks” (RSNs) or “intrinsic connectivity networks” (ICNs) ( ;  ). The ICA components extracted by enforcing orthogonality spatially represent the brain networks, while the FC correlation values between each network pair reflect interaction. Thus, ICA not only can investigate the FC within one specific network but also can test the FC across the networks. Moreover, using ICA, the subnetworks can be independently extracted. A previous study with a small sample size suggested that ICA is effective to identify the abnormal intrinsic FC within and between large-scale neural networks in depressed PD patients ( ). Therefore, we proposed that determining neural correlations with ICA could lead to the discovery of biomarkers to improve the diagnosis of PDD. \n\nThis study was proposed to use the RS-fMRI and ICA to systematically investigate not only the connectivity within but also the connectivity between DMN, ECN, SN, PCUN, and SMN in PDD patients and PD without depression (PDND) patients. Specifically, we first used the ICA to identify and decompose the networks into independent   z  -maps (reflecting the intrinsic FC of areas within each network, intra-FC), and then we computed the FC correlation values between each network pair representing the intrinsic FC between networks (inter-FC). Second, we would compare the intra-FC and inter-FC data among PDD patients, PDND patients, and healthy controls (HCs). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nForty-one PDD, 64 PDND patients, and 55 HCs were recruited with a written informed consent from the Second Xiangya Hospital between December 2015 and February 2020. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Medical Research of the Second Xiangya Hospital (2015-533). The criteria for recruited patients were as follows: (1) they met the United Kingdom Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria ( ); (2) they were right-handed Han Chinese; (3) they stopped anti-PD or anti-depressant medications for 12 h before imaging and neuropsychological examination; (4) their motor symptoms were evaluated by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) and Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) scale; (5) they had an H-Y staging score of between 1 and 3; (6) depression was diagnosed with the   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  , Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria by an experienced psychiatrist, and patients had a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) score higher than seven ( ). Afterward, the severity of depression was quantified with the HDRS-17 and the 21-item Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI); and (7) they had no apparent cognitive impairments, which were determined by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score not falling lower than the corresponding education level ( ). An MMSE score >17 for illiterate participants, >20 for grade-school literate participants, and >23 for junior high school and higher education literate participants were defined as normal MMSE scores in our patients. Patients were excluded if they had a history of head injury, stroke, or other neurologic or psychiatric disease; had an abnormal MMSE score; or had any disorders that interfere assessment of the manifestations of PD ( ). The same exclusion criteria listed above were applied to the control group. Neuropsychological examinations were used to excluded dementia and depression in controls. Five PDD patients, four PDND patients, and three HCs were excluded from the present analyses due to the stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. The demographic and clinical information is presented in  . \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the participants (mean ± SD). \n    \n\n### MR Image Acquisition and Data Preprocessing \n  \nThe procedure and parameters to obtain resting-state fMRI images were previously described ( ). During the image processing, the first 10 volumes were removed from each participants’ series, slice timing was aligned, and the head motion was corrected. Data from nine participants (five PDD and four PDND) who displayed excessive head motion were excluded from further analyses. The images were then spatially normalized to a standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, resampled to the voxel size of 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm, and spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (8 mm × 8 mm × 8 mm full width at half maximum). \n\n\n### Independent Component Analysis and Selection of Networks of Interest \n  \nThe ICs were analyzed by the Group ICA (the GIFT software ). The procedures based on this toolbox included three steps: (1) data reduction, (2) applying ICA algorithm, and (3) back-reconstruction for individual-level components. In this study, 38 ICs were auto-estimated through the minimum description length (MDL) criteria, and Group ICA was performed 20 times. Nine meaningful components were identified as anatomically and functionally classical RSNs   via   visual inspection. They were extracted from all participants, including the ventral DMN (vDMN), dorsal DMN (dDMN), PCUN, two SMNs, right ECN (RECN), left ECN (LECN), anterior SN (aSN), and two posterior SNs (pSN). Seven were related to the “triple-network” model, with three components reflecting the SN (one for the aSN and two for the pSN), two reflecting the DMN (one each for the vDMN and dDMN), and two reflecting the ECN (one each for the LECN and RECN) subnetworks. \n\n\n### Outcome Measures \n  \nThe 10 ICs corresponding to the triple networks, PCUN, and SMN were then extracted from all participants. For each subject, each component’s   z  -map and its corresponding temporal cortex (TC) reflected the measures of intra-FC. Linear detrending, despiking, and temporal filtering were conducted for all TCs of the networks of interest before evaluating the inter-FC ( ;  ). We calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients of the TCs for each network pair among the SN, DMN, central executive network (CEN) subsystems; PCUN; and SMN and then transformed the coefficients into   z  -scores by Fisher’s   z  -transformation. These transformed   z  -scores indexed the inter-FC of each network pair. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nSPSS v19 software was used for data analysis (IBM, United States). The differential brain regions were identified among the three groups using one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and   post hoc   two-sample   t  -test in a pair-wise manner. \n\nTo statistically analyze the FC within each selected ICN, it was calculated voxel-wise with participants’ reconstructed spatial maps using one-sample   t  -test SPM12 [  p   < 0.001, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected]. Comparisons of connectivity within each ICN among PDD, PDND, and HC groups were performed using a design model of one-way ANOVA in SPM12, followed by   post hoc   two-sample   t  -test (voxel level,   p   < 0.001, cluster size >10 voxels, corresponding to a corrected   p   < 0.05 as determined by AlphaSim correction). The between-groups differences of connectivity among selected ICNs were assessed using ANOVA, and   post hoc   two-sample   t  -test was used to determine connectivity changes between each pair of the three groups (  p   < 0.05, AlphaSim corrected). \n\nThe correlations between the detected connectivity abnormalities and the HDRS as well as the UPDRS-III scores were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient for the PDD and PDND patients. A   p   < 0.05 was considered significant. \n\nTo test whether the intra-connectivity can predict depression level in the PD patients, hierarchical regression analyses were performed on the depression level as indicated by HDRS scores. Five regression models were run in total. Age, gender, educational years, MMSE scores, UPDRS-III scores, and illness duration were entered as predictors in step 1. To evaluate which connectivity could significantly predict depression level and beyond the predictors included in step 1, regression model 1 included connectivity of all four brain regions, which were different between PDD and PDND as predictors in step 2, and a stepwise method was used to determine which predictors to retain in the final model. To evaluate the predictive value of connectivity of each of the four regions, the connectivity of one of the four regions was entered as the only predictor in step 2 for each of the other four regression models. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic Information \n  \nNo significant differences in H-Y staging, UPDRS-III, and PD duration were observed between the PDD and PDND patients, while no significant differences in gender, age, education level, relative gray matter volume (REL-GMV), MMSE scores, relative white matter volume (REL-WMV), and mean FD were observed between the three groups ( ). In contrast, significant differences in the HDRS-17 and BDI scores were observed among the three groups (  p   < 0.001). \n\n\n### Identification of Network of Interests \n  \nThe respective spatial patterns of 10 networks of interests for the three groups (PDD, PDND, and HCs) were revealed by the one-sample   t  -test ( , FDR corrected,   p   < 0.05), including the LECN (IC20), RECN (IC06), dDMN (IC11), pSN (IC09/12), vDMN (IC04), aSN (IC05), SMN (IC15/IC25), and PCUN (IC26). \n  \nLarge-scale networks including the 10 resting-state networks (RSNs) identified by independent component analysis.

Compared with the HC group, the PDD and PDND patients showed increased connectivity in the left hippocampus of the dDMN (Hippocampus_L). The PDD patients exhibited an increased connectivity in the left hippocampus of the dDMN (Hippocampus_L) and the right Cerebelum_Crus2 of the SMN (Cerebelum_Crus2_R) and a decreased connectivity in the right medial superior frontal gyrus (mSFG) of the aSN (Frontal_Sup_Medial_R) and the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) of the SMN (Temporal_Sup_R) than did the PDND group (  p   < 0.05,   and  ).

The PDD patients exhibited decreased connectivity between aSN/pSN and dDMN and between PCUN and dDMN/vDMN/SMN/RECN than did the HCs. The PDND patients exhibited a decreased connectivity between aSN and pSN, and PCUN and vDMN, as well as an increased connectivity between aSN and RECN than did the HCs. These alterations indicated an impaired FC between SN/PCUN and the other networks in the PDD and PDND patients. \n  \nComparisons of inter-network functional connectivity (FC) alterations in the resting-state networks (RSNs) between the Parkinson’s disease with depression (PDD) and PD without depression (PDND) groups.

Compared with PDND patients, PDD patients exhibited a decreased connectivity between anterior salience network (SN) (aSN) and bilateral executive control network (ECN), between posterior SN (pSN) and posterior default mode network (pDMN), and between precuneus network (PCUN) and pDMN/SMN/bilateral ECN. \n  \n\n### Correlation Analysis of Functional Connectivity With Neuropsychological Test Scores and Clinical Characteristics \n  \nThe Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated no significant correlations between altered FC values and any clinical variables (UPDRS-III/HDRS-17/BDI-21) in the patients with PD. \n\n\n### Intra-Network Connectivity Predicts Depression Levels in Parkinson’s Disease Patients \n  \nAfter demographical and clinical variables were controlled for, including age, gender, educational years, illness duration, MMSE scores, and UPDRS-III scores, connectivity within the left hippocampus of dDMN and the right mSFG of aSN was a significant predictor of depression level in the PD patients, when these FCs were considered either simultaneously or separately in the regression model after correction (  p   < 0.05/4).

Compared with the PDND patients, the PDD patients showed a decreased intra-connectivity in the aSN and SMN; increased intra-connectivity in the dDMN and SMN; and decreased inter-connectivity between aSN and bilateral ECN, between pSN and dDMN, and between PCUN and dDMN/vDMN/SMN/RECN. Our study provided evidence of aberrant connectivity patterns across broad-scale networks in PDD. \n\nIn this study, we found that the PDD patients showed decreased inter-connectivity between aSN and bilateral ECN, and between pSN and dDMN. The triple-network model supports cognitive, affective, perceptual, and social functions ( ). Thus, the disconnected communication from SN to ECN/DMN may cause disrupted top-down cognitive modulation over the limbic and subcortical structures, which may be involved in the onset and maintenance of depression. In addition, the occurrence of depression might arise from disturbance in more distributed neural networks, such as functional disruption of the prefrontal–limbic network ( ). Consistently, previous studies also demonstrated that the SN is involved in PDD. For instance,   reported that the disrupted connection between the SN and ECN might contribute to depression in PD.   reported that the involvement of BGN, DMN, LFPN, and SN in PD facilitates the development of depression. Therefore, the impaired interactions between the triple network are critical for the occurrence and maintenance of depression in PD. \n\nIn this study, the PDD patients exhibited decreased inter-network connectivity between precuneus and DMN/SMN/ECN. Previous studies have demonstrated that the abnormal function of the striatum and the associated limbic–BGN circuitry is proposed to play a role in the emotional processing system in patients with depression ( ;  ;  ). Studies have also shown that SMN is activated during bimanual motor tasks, suggesting the involvement of SMN in a pre-mediated state that prompts the brain in performing/coordinating a motor task ( ). Thus, the vulnerability of the distinct PCUN and other large-scale networks plays a major role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative processes in the PDD patients. Our results suggest that the functional integrity of prefrontal–limbic–striatal–cortex circuitry function is involved in the pathogenesis of PDD. \n\nIn this study, the PDD patients had decreased connectivity in the right STG of the aSN and the right mSFG of the SMN and increased connectivity in the left hippocampus of the dDMN and the right Cerebelum_Crus2 of the SMN. Previous studies have shown hypoactivity, decreased metabolism, reduced density, and FC of the STG in PDD patients ( ;  ;  ). The prefrontal cortex containing the mSFG serves an important function as a top-down modulator of emotional tasks ( ). The   study with ReHo and FC methods found that PDD patients had increased regional activity in the left frontal and medial frontal gyri than had non-depressed PD patients. Our previous study found abnormal ReHo values in both the cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal area of depressed PD patients ( ).   found that the right medial frontal gyrus activation could be a biomarker for the occurrence and the severity of depression in PD. The hippocampus is a major culprit of emotional dysregulation, contributing to the pathophysiology of depression in PD ( ). However, a previous study reported that PDD patients reduced connectivity of putamen with mesolimbic regions, particularly in the hippocampus ( ). This discrepancy might be due to the neural network remodeling caused by anti-PD or anti-depressant medications. A meta-analysis study demonstrated that the Cerebelum_Crusl and Cerebelum_Crus2 areas were involved in executive functions and complex cognitive functions (including language, working memory, etc.) ( ). Both structural ( ) and functional ( ) abnormalities of the cerebellum are present in movement and emotional disorders in depressed PD patients.   observed the interactive effects of motor and depressive symptoms on the bilateral posterior cerebellum. \n\nAlthough some previous authors associated hyper-connectivity with functional compensation ( ;  ), many others have considered increases in connectivity as a reflection of functional disruption ( ) and altered neuronal communication ( ). It is therefore considered that “functional disconnection” implies both functional hypo-connectivity and hyper-connectivity. Recently, growing evidence ( ;  ) has shown that aside from its traditional integration of motor functions, the cerebellum takes part in the regulation of non-motor functions, such as language, cognition, and emotion.   observed an increased ALFF in the right cerebellum posterior lobe in depressed PD patients when compared with non-depressed PD patients. The increases in connectivity in the right cerebellum might be not only a compensatory mechanism for the defective motor system but also a reflection of functional disruption and altered neuronal communication. Thus, the STG, mSFG, hippocampus, and Cerebelum_Crus2 are likely the critical hubs in the neural circuits related with depression in PD patients. \n\nSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of the present study. First, although the adoption of a 38-component ICA model was auto-estimated, there was no clear computational criterion for the number. Second, no significant correlations were found between the variables (intra-FC and inter-FC) and motor or non-motor scale scores (UPDRS-III/HDRS-17/BDI-21). This may be biased due to the small sample size in PDD group. Further studies in a larger sample size will be necessary to explore the relationship between connectivity abnormalities and the severity of depression in PDD. Third, it should be noted that none of our results could survive at the strict AlphaSim correction level of   p   < 0.001. However, in this study, the combination of the AlphaSim correction of   p   < 0.05 with individual voxel threshold at   p   < 0.001 and the required cluster size adopted was acceptable based on the previous studies ( ;  ). Our power analysis also indicated reliable effect sizes for our results. We were cautious in generalizing our results, and further studies are needed. Fourth, the patients in the current study were not drug naïve. Although the anti-PD or anti-depressant medications were stopped for 12 h before imaging and neuropsychological testing, the potentially confounding effects of chronic medications could not be avoided. Fifth, the lack of a primary depression group left the question of whether PDD shares a common neurobiological substrate with primary depression unanswered. Finally, this is a cross-sectional study. It remains unsolved whether the found alterations represent state or trait characteristics of our patient cohort. \n\nIn conclusion, abnormal FC between RSNs may reflect the neuroimaging characteristics of the prefrontal–limbic–striatal–cortex circuitry-related networks. The RSNs in PDD or PDND patients are not restricted to the triple-network model but rather spread to other neural networks such as PCUN and SMN. Specifically, we found that both the aberrant intra- and inter-network FC is involved in several important hubs in the large-scale networks. This study highlighted that aberrant intra-network FC and inter-network FC can be biomarkers for distinguishing PDD from PDND, and our findings can help understand the neural foundation of the depression in PD. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Medical Research Ethical Committee of the Second Xiangya Hospital.

In the Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model, CAS is a set of psychological processes that includes repetitive negative thinking (worry and rumination), threat monitoring, and associated unhelpful behavioral and cognitive strategies; it is derived from metacognitive beliefs, either positive (e.g., “If I ruminate I will understand my situation”) or negative (e.g., “I cannot control my ruminative thoughts”). While moments of negative self-appraisal are relatively brief in most people, the prolonged occurrence of negative emotions and negative self-appraisal in some people is due to recurring activation of CAS. This specific style of responding to negative thoughts is considered a transdiagnostic factor which underlies emotional disorders. Many studies have confirmed the relationship of CAS with emotional distress as well as symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders ( ,  ). According to the metacognitive model, CAS is a prominent factor in the development of mood disorders, e.g., major depressive disorder (MDD;  ,  ,  ;  ), anxiety disorders, e.g., generalized anxiety disorder (GAD;  ,  ,  ,  ), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD;  ;  ;  ), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD;  ;  , ;  ;  ). \n\nA fundamental element of CAS is a pattern of negative, pervasive, and recurring thoughts. Rumination is associated with decreased attentional resources ( ;  ), the occurrence of negative emotions, and difficulties with problem solving ( ). A ruminative thinking style is most often associated with mood disorders, as it is a risk factor for the development of depression ( ) and is generally associated with dysphoric and depressive mood ( ). However, rumination is not only present in mood disorders – it also plays a prominent role in the symptomatology of other emotional and psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety or eating disorders ( ). Pathological worry, another form of extended thinking, is considered a key feature of GAD; however, many researchers have shown that it also occurs in other types of emotional disorders (e.g.,  ;  ). \n\nTo date, there have been no studies on brain functioning in people with high levels of CAS – i.e., elevated levels of CAS-related symptomatology: repetitive negative thinking, attention to threats, unhelpful coping behaviors, and maladaptive metacognitive beliefs. There are, however, some studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods in which induction of core aspects of CAS – rumination (state rumination rather than trait rumination;  ;  ;  ) or worry ( ) – has been employed. The first two of the aforementioned studies on rumination induction compared depressed participants to healthy controls, while the third compared adolescents with remitted MDD to healthy controls. The Rumination Induction task used in an fMRI setting by   consisted of alternating blocks of ruminative, concrete, and abstract sentences which participants were asked to think about (e.g., “think about the expectations people have for you”). In this procedure, ruminative sentences, in comparison to concrete/abstract sentences, were associated with altered activity in brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation in depressed patients: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, cingulate cortices, amygdalae, and parahippocampi ( ). Another study compared resting state functional connectivity with functional connectivity during negative mood induction using personalized cues created by ruminating on negative autobiographical events (e.g., “Please recall a specific time when you were very embarrassed”;  ). This study showed that depressed patients had stronger connections within brain regions belonging to the default mode network (DMN), like the cingulate cortex. It was suggested that these results may be understood as difficulty in down-regulating self-oriented emotional and cognitive processing after rumination induction ( ). A fourth study ( ) found that rumination induction with prior negative mood induction (e.g., “Remember when you failed badly at something”) elicits stronger neural activations in regions involved in the DMN and emotion processing in remitted MDD adolescents. A study by   explored differences in worrying between patients with GAD and healthy controls. Sentences which induce worrying (e.g., “Mull over what worries you about your future”) were related to activation in the anterior cingulate and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex in the GAD group. \n\nSeveral recent meta-analyses on neuronal functioning in people with depression ( ;  ), specific phobias ( ), and PTSD ( ) show, in general, that emotional disorders are most prominently connected to the dysregulation of subcortical brain areas involved in emotion processing, i.e., the amygdalae and hippocampi, as well as the striatum. This dysregulation is interpreted as the overdeveloped salience of threatening or saddening stimuli. Also, several cortical regions are involved in this type of processing, like the insulae and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Studies on repetitive negative thinking induction and large meta-analyses on emotional disorders have found that people experiencing mood and anxiety disorders exhibit dysregulation of the default mode, salience, and executive networks. Overall, people with emotional disorders demonstrate a pattern of disrupted neural processing in the areas of self-referential, task-oriented, and emotional processing ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nIn the current study, we aimed to explore differences in neural functioning between people with high and low levels of CAS symptoms. Given that there are no previous studies on the neural correlates of CAS, we decided to base our hypotheses on available work on repetitive negative thinking induction and meta-analytical results regarding emotional disorders which, according to metacognitive theory, are undergirded by CAS. We hypothesized that people with high levels of CAS symptoms will show similar patterns of cortical activations to those found in studies on neural correlates of depressive and anxiety disorders, as described above. To test these hypotheses, we employed a modified Rumination Induction procedure and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). We expected that differences in neural activation in people with high levels of CAS symptoms (HCAS) would be comparable to the patterns of activation reported by   in depressed patients, with greater neural activity in the amygdalae, hippocampi, and cingulate and dorsolateral cortices in the rumination condition as compared to the abstract condition. We also hypothesized that the cortical regions associated with rumination and which show aberrant activity in emotional disorders will show different patterns of functional connectivity in the HCAS group in comparison to the group with low levels of CAS symptoms (LCAS). We expected to find disrupted patterns of connectivity within and between several neural networks: the DMN, the salience network, and the central executive network (CEN). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Procedure and Sample Selection \n  \nParticipation in the study was voluntary and participants gave their informed consent. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw. The study was conducted in two stages. The first stage took place through an Internet survey panel and was conducted by an external company. A large sample was gathered for the purpose of an fMRI study, so there were standard strict exclusion criteria related to the fMRI procedure (left-handedness, metal objects within the body, irremovable piercings, etc.) as well as any history of neurological or serious mental disorders or substance abuse disorders. Participants were also required to live in the Warsaw area to ensure their ability to participate in the second stage of the study. A total of 1,225 participants were eligible and completed the first stage of the study. Participants were selected based on quotas mirroring the population of Warsaw ( ) in terms of sex, age, and education.   depicts the selection procedure from the first to the final stage of the study. \n  \nConsort flow-chart of enrollment and samples selection for the study. \n  \nFrom the first stage participants, two extreme groups were selected. As the results of previous studies ( ) have suggested that combining different measures of aspects of CAS is best for predicting levels of psychopathology, several measures were used in forming the two groups. The cut-off criterion was a score above the 66th percentile or below the 33rd percentile of the sum of results on the following measures: the CAS-1 questionnaire, the Brooding subscale of the RRS (as this aspect of rumination is most robustly associated with depressive and anxiety disorders, cf.  ), and the Need to Control Thoughts as well as the Uncontrollability and Danger subscales from the MCQ-30, as these aspects of metacognitive beliefs are most prominently connected to levels of anxiety and depression (cf.  ;  ;  ;  ). Finally two extreme groups, each consisting of 134 subjects, were formed. \n\nThe second stage of the study took part in the Laboratory of Brain Imaging, Neurobiology Center, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences. Participants were invited to the laboratory in a random order by a person from an external company. Researchers were blinded to the participants’ group affiliation. A total of 89 participants took part in the study – 43 in the HCAS group and 46 in the LCAS group. Participants who underwent the whole fMRI procedure were given a sum of money equivalent to about 50 EUR. \n\nThe second stage of the study occurred 4–22 weeks after the first stage, depending on the timing of the participants’ second stage appointment. Despite the acceptable time-stability of the questionnaire results between the first and second stages of the study (correlations of results at these two time points: CAS-1:   r   = 0.83,   p   < 0.001, RRS – Brooding:   r   = 0.82,   p   < 0.001, MCQ – Need to Control Thoughts:   r   = 0.76,   p   < 0.001, MCQ – Uncontrollability and Danger:   r   = 0.82,   p   < 0.001) some shift in individual results was observed. To ensure that both groups had extreme characteristics, participants had to have results above or below median on all four measures used in the study. As a result, 31 participants were excluded: 30 had mixed results and 1 “changed groups” as this participant had HCAS results on the internet measures but LCAS results on the day of the fMRI scan. Ultimately, data from 58 participants (HCAS = 25, LCAS = 33) were analyzed and are presented in this paper. Group demographic characteristics are presented in  . These groups were also clinically diagnosed with a SCID-I interview but full results are presented elsewhere ( ; Dragan and Kowalski, unpublished). A total of 45% of participants from the HCAS group and none from LCAS group met the diagnostic criteria for a current diagnosis of a psychological disorder. In the HCAS group, 12 participants were diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR criteria with: MDD (1), dysthymic disorder (1), GAD (2), GAD comorbid with social phobia (1), GAD comorbid with social phobia and dysthymic disorder (1), PTSD comorbid with MDD (1), PTSD comorbid with social phobia (1), PTSD comorbid with binge eating (1), cyclothymic disorder comorbid with bulimia nervosa (1), depressive disorder NOS (1), and anxiety disorder NOS (1). All participants were treatment-naive and diagnosis-naive at the beginning of the study. The second stage of the procedure consisted of filling-in questionnaires (CAS-1, RRS, MCQ-30, SCL-27) followed by the MRI procedure, including: a T1-weighted structural scan, rsfMRI, and a Rumination Induction procedure. This MRI procedure lasted approximately 40 min in total and constituted a part of a larger MRI study. After the MRI procedure, participants filled-in PANAS and STAI questionnaires. A schematic representation of the procedure is displayed in  . \n  \nGroup characteristics – demographic and clinical variables. \n      \nSchematic diagram of the study procedure. \n  \n\n### Measures and Materials \n  \n#### The Cognitive-Attentional Syndrome Questionnaire (CAS-1) \n  \nThe CAS-1 questionnaire ( ) consists of 16 items measuring aspects of CAS: worry/rumination, attention to threat, maladaptive behaviors, and metacognitive beliefs. The results of the questionnaire were calculated as in the paper by   – the last eight items were recalculated to range between 0 and 8 before summing them up. The total results range from 0 to 128, where a higher result indicates a greater level of CAS. The psychometric qualities of the Polish version of CAS-1 are presented elsewhere ( ). In the current study, CAS-1 had excellent internal consistency of Cronbach’s α = 0.91. \n\n\n#### Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) \n  \nThe 22-item Ruminative Response Scale focuses on one’s responses to depressive mood: concentration on the self, symptoms, and the causes and consequences of depressive mood. A newer approach ( ) distinguishes two subscales: “Reflection” and “Brooding.” Only the results of the latter are presented in this study. This subscale consists of five items with results ranging from 5 to 20, where a higher result indicates a greater tendency to respond to depressed mood with brooding. The Polish version of the RRS has generally good psychometric qualities ( ). In the current study, the Brooding subscale had internal consistency of Cronbach’s α = 0.88. \n\n\n#### Metacognitions Questionnaire – Short Version (MCQ-30) \n  \nThe short version of the Metacognitions Questionnaire, developed by  , consists of five subscales and 30 items. It concerns metacognitive beliefs: monitoring techniques, judgments, and beliefs about one’s thoughts and cognitive abilities central to the metacognitive model of psychopathology. Two subscales are of interest in present study: the “Uncontrollability and Danger” scale explores the negative aspects of worry, e.g., “My worrying is dangerous for me” and the “Need to Control Thoughts” scale deals with beliefs about the negative consequences of not controlling one’s thoughts, e.g., “Not being able to control my thoughts is a sign of weakness.” The Polish version of this questionnaire exhibits good psychometric qualities and is considered equivalent to the English version ( ). In this study, these two MCQ-30 subscales had good internal consistencies of α = 0.89 and α = 0.84, respectively. \n\n\n#### Symptom Checklist 27 Plus (SCL-27-Plus) \n  \nThis is a checklist-type questionnaire that measures depressive, vegetative, agoraphobic, sociophobic, and pain symptoms ( ), and it allows the calculation of a global severity index (GSI). The results on each scale can range from 0 to 20, where higher scores indicate higher levels of a given symptom. In this study, the Polish adaptation of the questionnaire was used ( ) and it had an excellent internal consistency of Cronbach’s α = 0.93. \n\n\n#### Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) \n  \nThis is a comprehensive measure of emotions with two distinct subscales of positive and negative affect ( ). In this study, a Polish adaptation of the 30-item PANAS-state questionnaire, which has good psychometric qualities, was used ( ). In the current study, the internal consistencies of its subscales were α = 0.82 and α = 0.80, respectively. \n\n\n#### State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) \n  \nA widely used measurement of anxiety and its cognitive and vegetative components ( ). In this study, a Polish adaptation of the STAI-state questionnaire, which has good psychometric qualities, was used ( ). In the current study, the internal consistency was Cronbach’s α = 0.93. \n\n\n#### Resting State fMRI \n  \nThe resting state procedure consisted of a fixation cross being shown for 10 min on the MRI display (cf.  ;  ). Subjects were instructed to fix their gaze on the cross and to not move. \n\n\n#### Modified Rumination Induction (RumInd-M) fMRI Task \n  \nDuring rumination induction, participants are asked to think about sentences that are designed to induce the process of rumination ( ). The sentences deal with themes of the reader’s own emotions, appraisals, and experiences. In this task, we used the mix of stimuli used by  ; rumination induction) and by  ; worry induction) to obtain a robust repetitive negative thinking effect in participants. We used the modified procedure from   with ruminative/worrying sentences (e.g., “Think about the opportunities you didn’t take in your life,” “Think about what worries you have about your health”; RUM), and abstract sentences (e.g., “Think about how a plant grows”; ABS) as a control condition (see Appendix   for all stimuli used). Participants were asked to think about sentences presented on screen and to try to clear their minds when a cross appeared on screen. Each sentence was presented on screen for 30 s and sentences were separated by 10 s of a fixation cross. Four blocks of five sentences were presented in a non-consecutive order (RUM-ABS-RUM-ABS). After each block, participants assessed their sadness, anxiety, and engagement in thinking on a 1–5 Likert scale. Results from this task are the totals of the assessments from both blocks of the same type. The task lasted about 15 min. Two parallel versions of rumination induction were used. Versions did not differ on any of the results (all values of   p   > 0.05) and administration of the versions did not differ between HCAS and LCAS groups, χ  = 0.43,   p   = 0.51. \n\n\n\n### Behavior Analysis \n  \nInternal consistency was calculated with Cronbach’s α. Group differences were analyzed with Student’s   t  -test for independent samples or χ  for nominal data, group differences were calculated to demonstrate effect sizes using Cohen’s   d  . Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS 24, effect sizes were calculated using an online calculator . \n\n\n### MRI Data Acquisition and Analysis \n  \nData were acquired using a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Trio system (Siemens Medical Solutions) equipped with a 12-channel head coil: structural T1-weighted image (TR: 2,530 ms, TE: 3.32 ms, flip angle: 7°, voxel size: 1 × 1 × 1 mm, field of view: 256 mm, measurements: 1), rsfMRI (TR: 2,000 ms, TE: 28 ms, flip angle: 80°, voxel size: 3 × 3 × 3 mm, field of view: 216 mm, measurements: 200), and task fMRI (TR: 2,500 ms, TE: 28 ms, flip angle: 80°, voxel size: 3 × 3 × 3 mm, field of view: 216, measurements: 364). After the rsfMRI and rumination induction tasks, B0 inhomogeneity field maps were collected (TR: 400 ms, TE: 4.5 ms/6.96 ms, flip angle: 60°, voxel size: 3 × 3 × 3 mm, field of view: 216 mm, measurements: 1). \n\nThe DICOM series were converted to NIfTI and BIDS data formats with Horos Bids Output . Spatial preprocessing was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12 ). Functional images were corrected for distortions related to magnetic field inhomogeneity, corrected for motion by realignment to the first acquired image, slice-timed, normalized to the MNI space, and resliced to obtain a resolution of 2 × 2 × 2 mm, and smoothed with the 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Before normalization, structural images were coregistered to the mean functional image and segmented into separate tissues using the default tissue probability maps. Functional data were also analyzed with the Artifact Detection Toolbox (ART ). Any EPI which deviated from the previous one by 3SD, 1.6 mm, or 0.04 rad was considered an outlier and such EPIs were regressed out in the 1st level models. Averages of 4.12%,   SD   = 2.64%, of scans for the rumination induction task and of 4.74%,   SD   = 4.13%, of scans for rsfMRI were regressed out. Participants with more than 20% outliers were excluded from the analyses. Based on these criteria no participants were excluded. There were no differences between groups in the number of outliers in the rumination induction task (  t   = 0.23,   p   = 0.82) or in the resting state (  t   = -1.76,   p   = 0.08), there were also no differences in the number of outliers between RUM and ABS conditions (  t   = 0.23,   p   = 0.82). Functional data were high pass filtered (1,000 s for rumination induction and 128 s for rsfMRI), and fixation crosses in the rumination induction task were modeled as baseline. Data were analyzed as a flexible factorial model of group × condition activation and with a two sample   t  -test of RUM > ABS and ABS > RUM contrasts. A regressor with a mock variable for gender was added to the second level models. On a group level, a voxel-wise height threshold of   p   < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons using the family wise error (FWE) rate was employed for whole brain analyses. Thresholded fMRI maps and raw data are available to any researcher upon request. \n\n#### Functional Connectivity Analyses \n  \nThe CONN (ver. 18 ) toolbox was used to perform functional connectivity analyses. First level SPM files and functional data for the resting state and rumination induction were imported into the software. Data were denoised with use of the respective T1-weighted scans, normalized to MNI-space, with eight regressors for WM and seven regressors for CSF, and with movement parameters obtained with the ART toolbox. The acceptance threshold for denoised signal voxel-to-voxel correlations was on average   r   ≤ 0.1. Resting state connectivity was calculated as HRF modulated pairwise correlations with seed-to-voxel analyses with a regressor for gender. RumInd connectivity was calculated as HRF modulated pairwise regressions with seed-to-voxel analyses of the generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI;  ) of group (HCAS and LCAS) versus condition (RUM and ABS) interactions with a regressor for gender. To make things clearer, η , the effect size for the interaction analysis, was transformed into Cohen’s   d   using an online calculator (see footnote 1). The threshold for significance was set at   p   ≤ 0.05 with false discovery rate cluster correction (FDRc). Figures depicting the connectivity analyses were made with use of MRIcroGL . \n\n\n#### Seed Definitions \n  \nROIs (regions of interest) chosen for functional connectivity seeds were based on main effects of the RUM condition from the rumination induction task and analysis of meta-analytic literature on the neural correlates of emotional disorders (i.e., depression and anxiety), these being conceptually most similar to CAS activation. Spheres of   r   = 6 mm were created over the obtained peak activations or the coordinates of peak activations provided by other authors. The MarsBar toolbox  was used to create ROIs. Talairach coordinates from meta-analyses were converted to MNI coordinates with the mni2tal calculator . Nine ROIs were extracted from the RUM > ABS contrast from the rumination induction task: left and right precunei [-4 -58 32, -8 -52 28 and 6 -52 26], middle cingulate cortex [0 -18 36], L-paracingulate gyrus [-6 52 8], L- and R-superior frontal gyri [-2 56 38 and 6 52 28] and L- and R-frontal poles [-4 62 24 and 4 56 10]. Task-based ROI labels were based on an Harvard–Oxford anatomical atlas. Nine ROIs were extracted from meta-analyses on depressive and anxiety disorders: sub-callosal gyrus [2 16 -12], R-anterior cingulate cortex [10 30 -4] (Depression;  ), L-insula [-41 -3 -14], R-dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [-2 32 21], R-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [30 10 50], and L-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [-23 25 46] (Depression;  ), L-insula [-42 14 -1] (Social anxiety disorder;  ), R-anterior cingulate [5 28 18], and R-middle frontal gyrus [41 9 40] (PTSD;  ). Literature-based ROI labels were based on nomenclature used by the authors of meta-analyses. Due to the long-block nature of the rumination induction task, we limited these analyses to cortical regions chosen as ROIs. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nHCAS and LCAS groups differed strongly on all CAS measures (CAS-1, RRS-brooding, and MCQ-30 subscales) and all the subscales of SCL-27-plus used in this study. All differences were large in effect size with values of   d   > 3.5 for CAS measures and values of   d   > 1.3 for measures of psychopathology. There were more women in the HCAS group, for this reason, a mock variable for gender was added to the second levels of the fMRI and functional connectivity analyses. The groups also differed significantly with medium-to-large effect sizes on their assessments during rumination induction, both in RUM and ABS conditions as well as post-scan measurements of anxiety and negative emotions – for details see  . \n  \nBehavioral results of RumInd-M task and post-scan assessments. \n    \n\n### Neuroimaging Results \n  \nSignificant neural activations in the whole sample for RUM > ABS and ABS > RUM contrasts are presented in   and  . The RUM > ABS condition yielded activations in bilateral precunei, bilateral superior frontal cortices, bilateral frontal poles, and the middle cingulate cortex. The ABS > RUM condition yielded several cortical activations: bilateral middle temporal gyri, bilateral supramarginal gyri, L-precentral gyrus, R-middle and inferior frontal gyri, and bilateral frontal poles. We did not find any differences between groups in neuronal activity in contrasts between RUM and ABS conditions in the rumination induction task, in the flexible factorial model, or in the two sample   t  -test models. \n  \nNeural activations in the whole sample (both groups together) for RUM > ABS and ABS > RUM contrasts.

The L-precuneus [-4 -58 32] showed increased connectivity with parts of the L-lateral occipital cortex and supramarginal gyrus in the HCAS group in the RUM condition in comparison to the LCAS group and decreased connectivity with bilateral parts of the precunei in the RUM condition in comparison to the LCAS group; opposite effects were observed in the ABS condition. The L-superior frontal gyrus showed decreased connectivity with parts of the L-superior parietal lobule and postcentral gyrus in the HCAS group in the ABS condition in comparison to the LCAS group and increased connectivity with the R-precuneus in this group in the ABS condition in comparison to LCAS group; opposite effects were seen in the RUM condition. Also, the L-precuneus [-8 -52 28] showed increased connectivity with bilateral frontal poles in the HCAS group in the RUM condition in comparison to the LCAS group and the opposite effect was found in the ABS condition. There was also increased connectivity in the HCAS group in the RUM condition between the R-precuneus and parts of the L-angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus in comparison to the LCAS group; the opposite effect was observed in the ABS condition. The R-frontal pole showed decreased connectivity in the HCAS group in the RUM condition with four effect clusters in the right temporal and right parietal lobes (see   for details) in comparison to the LCAS group; opposite effects were observed in the ABS condition. A similar pattern of connectivity was observed in the R-anterior cingulate cortex and its effect clusters – bilateral precentral and R-postcentral gyri, and R-pre- and postcentral gyri. All presented interaction effects are significant with large effect sizes of Cohen’s   d   > 1. \n  \nGroup differences in gPPI rumination induction functional connectivity. \n      \nSeed and effect clusters for gPPI analyses.

The HCAS group showed increased connectivity in comparison to the LCAS group between the L-insula and the L-central opercular cortex and planum temporale. Similarly, stronger connectivity in the HCAS group was found for the seed in the R-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex leading to three resulting clusters in the R-occipital pole and intracalcarine cortex, R-occipital pole and lingual gyrus, and the L-intracalcarine cortex and lingual gyrus. On the other hand, there was decreased connectivity in the HCAS group in comparison to the LCAS group between the R-anterior cingulate cortex and the L-frontal pole.

For details, see  . \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study used the rumination induction fMRI task and rsfMRI method to disentangle differences in the neural functioning of people with elevated levels of CAS in comparison to people with low levels of CAS. We ensured that the groups had extreme characteristics by pre-selecting two subsamples of people with low and high results on various measures of CAS and, additionally, by excluding participants with non-extreme and inconclusive results on the day of the study. A series of self-assessment questionnaires before, during, and after the fMRI procedure was used to address different levels of CAS, psychopathology symptoms, and negative emotions. \n\n### Group Differences in Self-Assessment \n  \nBy their construction, the studied groups differed significantly on all used measures of CAS – the CAS-1 questionnaire, rumination, and metacognitive beliefs concerning the need to control thoughts as well as the perceived inability to control thoughts and the associated dangers. Nevertheless, both groups also differed in levels of psychopathology symptoms – both depressive ( ,  ;  ,  ) and anxiety symptoms ( ;  ,  ), as well as pain symptoms. This result is in line with numerous studies on the relationships of psychopathology with somatic symptoms and complaints ( ;  ;  ). It is noteworthy that the groups did not differ in terms of physical illnesses and concerns reported in SCID-I (cf. Dragan and Kowalski, unpublished). The discrepancy between lack of difference in number of physical illnesses and concerns in SCID-I and large difference in self-reported levels of pain symptoms may be due to self-focused attention and threat monitoring in people with high levels of CAS, resulting in fixation of attention on bodily sensations that would otherwise go unnoticed. Such a mechanism would be consistent with an understanding of health anxiety based on the metacognitive model ( ). \n\nThere were medium to large group differences in reported assessments of sadness and anxiety during rumination induction, but not in assessments of engagement. The HCAS group scored significantly higher on levels of these negative emotions not only when assessing their mood after the rumination condition but also, with smaller effect size, after reading the abstract sentences. Results from previous studies on patients with depression are mixed: in one study there were no differences in negative affect between MDD patients and controls during rumination induction despite initial differences ( ), and another study ( ) found a significant effect of group, as remitted MDD adolescents had higher sadness ratings during both rumination and abstract conditions. Our study dealt with people with time-persistent high or low levels of CAS, so these results may indicate that CAS levels are a prominent characteristic related to experiencing negative affect during rumination induction. This could serve as an explanation of remitted MDD adolescents having higher negative affect scores at all times ( ) and current MDD patients ( ) having such scores only initially, before rumination induction. This hypothesis needs to be verified by further studies which take these results about CAS levels into account. The large-effect group differences in levels of post-fMRI assessments of anxiety and negative emotions are also in line with this interpretation. Unfortunately, we did not collect pre-rumination-induction assessments of affect, which would enable the comparison of effects of group as well as group and time interactions. \n\n\n### Effects of Negative and Abstract Thinking \n  \nThe results pertaining to main effects of conditions are partially in line with previous results about rumination induction ( ). The RUM > ABS direct comparison in our study revealed neural activations in the bilateral precunei, middle cingulate cortex, L-paracingulate gyrus, bilateral superior frontal gyri, and bilateral frontal poles.   reported a similar pattern of activations with larger parts of the frontal cortices as well as the occipital and temporal gyri, but using a lenient statistical threshold. This indicates engagement of the DMN ( ) with the most prominent activation in both precunei ( ). Precuneal activity is often linked to self-referential processing ( ;  ) and depressive rumination ( ;  ;  ;  ). The medial parts of the prefrontal cortex are also associated with self focused attention ( ) and emotional responses ( ). Such a pattern of activation during negative thinking induction may reflect cognitive components of negative thinking, specifically self-focused attention and self-referential processing. There were no significant brain activations in regions involved in emotional processing in the RUM > ABS comparison, i.e., in the amygdalae, parahippocampal gyri, or insulae. \n\nInterestingly the ABS > RUM contrast (not reported by  ) revealed strong activations in the bilateral middle temporal gyri, bilateral supramarginal gyri, L-precentral gyrus, R-middle and inferior frontal gyri, L-precentral gyrus and bilateral frontal poles. Widely distributed cortical activations in parts of the frontal poles (considered functionally as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and parts of the parietal lobes can be identified as parts of the CEN ( ). The activity of the CEN, in opposition to the DMN, is associated with performing cognitive tasks, attention functioning, and working memory. The CEN as well as middle temporal regions and supplementary motor areas are also part of the “task-positive network” ( ), which is a net of functionally correlated regions engaged in attention and working memory. This may indicate that abstract sentences engaged participants in tasks that required their attentional resources and were cognitively demanding. \n\nThe obtained patterns of neural activity specific to negative and abstract sentences are different and emphasize cognitive differences between these two types of thinking. It is also worth noting that both the DMN and CEN are engaged in the process of mind wandering ( ). In light of our results, this may indicate that mind wandering is comprised of self-referential rumination and dwelling on abstract cognitions. \n\n\n### Group Differences in Modified Rumination Induction \n  \nAs rumination induction has scarcely been used to-date in fMRI studies, we based our hypotheses concerning group differences on results obtained by   in a group of depressed patients. We did not replicate these results, i.e., we did not uncover any significant group differences between HCAS and LCAS groups in rumination induction in the basic fMRI analysis. There may be several reasons for this. The first reason may be the very design of the rumination induction task: it is comprised of blocks of five sentences which each last 30 s and are divided by 10 s fixation crosses, which gives almost 200 s per block. This may subject the obtained data to physiological noise ( ) or noise due to the instabilities of the magnetic field inside the scanner ( ). As such, long blocks prevent the filtering of low-frequency changes in the fMRI signal. Thus, it would be recommended to use shorter blocks or event-related paradigms in future studies. The second reason may be that the sentences used in our study did not directly tap into the individual experiences of participants, but were more general, aiming to evoke rumination or worry in every person, regardless of their personal experiences. This may have resulted in weaker responses to the stimuli used. It may be expected that personalized ruminative sentences would evoke much higher responses in participants (cf.  ;  ). Another reason may be the heterogeneity of obtained results, as high levels of CAS can manifest in different ways, with a person developing mood or anxiety disorders or comorbid disorders, producing differences on the cognitive level which could result in high variability of the fMRI signal across the whole brain. However, it is also possible that the results of   are not replicable. The authors used a rather liberal statistical threshold. Moreover they employed AFNI and AlphaSim software, in which a bug which elevates levels of false positive results has been identified ( ). Taking all the above into account, it is possible that in the rumination induction task used, brain activity related to repetitive negative thinking is similar in both sub-populations and potential between-group differences are not detectable with ‘static’ general linear model analysis. Thus we decided to seek possible between-group differences, delving into more dynamic temporal characteristics of brain activity, i.e., applying functional connectivity analyses. \n\n\n### Generalized Psychophysiological Interactions \n  \nThe results of this study provide the first evidence that high levels of CAS are related to disrupted patterns of functional neural connectivity. Moreover, the between-group differences were found not only during rumination and worry, but also in abstract thinking. We conducted a gPPI functional connectivity analysis using areas found to be active in the RUM condition as seeds as well as ROIs based on meta-analytical literature on mood and anxiety disorders. The results show disrupted functional connectivity in the HCAS group within the DMN – the precunei, the medial parts of the prefrontal cortices, and parts of the occipital cortex ( ;  ) – during evoked negative thoughts. This may indicate a heightened tendency toward self-referential thinking and focusing attention on the self ( ;  ). A similar pattern of functional connectivity was also found in depression and interpreted as an inability of MDD patients to down-regulate cognitive activity broadly associated with the DMN ( ). \n\nThere was also an interaction indicating a pattern of heightened connectivity in the RUM condition and/or lowered connectivity in the ABS condition in the HCAS group in comparison to the LCAS group between the L-precuneus and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (vlPFC), which play a role in emotion processing in MDD ( ). Furthermore the vlPFC are associated with anxiety (in primates;  ) and, more specifically, attention bias to both threatening and neutral stimuli in anxiety and anxiety related disorders ( ) and PTSD ( ). Previous research on adolescents ( ;  ) has shown that functioning of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex may be modulated by the amygdala in social phobia and GAD. Current results suggest that the functioning of the vlPFC is modulated by disrupted functioning of the DMN, particularly the precuneus, which may “override” the regulatory role of the vlPFC in emotional processing and indicates the proneness of HCAS subjects to attention bias in self-referential processing ( ). \n\nWe also observed a disrupted connectivity pattern in parts of the DMN during the abstract condition in the HCAS group. Interaction indicating increased connectivity was found between medial parts of the frontal cortex and R-precuneus, as well as within frontal and parietal parts of the DMN, and also within the precunei. Diminished connectivity of the anterior part of the cingulate cortex, interpreted as part of the salience network ( ), with medial parts of the somatosensory cortex was found in the HCAS group in both RUM and ABS conditions, as compared to the LCAS group. A similar pattern of connectivity was also found between part of the DMN – the medial part of the prefrontal cortex (mPFC) – and the medial part of the somatosensory cortex. The rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which plays a role in the symptomatology of various emotional disorders ( ), was shown to modulate the activity of the amygdala in task ( ) and resting state ( ) fMRI. Diminished connectivity between the ACC, mPFC, and somatosensory cortex in the HCAS group may indicate the mechanism of disrupted regulation of perception of bodily sensations. This result may be in line with the higher scores on the pain and vegetative symptoms subscale of the SCL-27-plus in the HCAS group. Perhaps the disrupted connectivity of the ACC, mPFC, and somatosensory cortex is related to one of the core mechanisms of CAS – heightened vigilance and monitoring for threatening stimuli, including threatening bodily sensations, which is characteristic of anxiety and anxiety-related disorders ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThere was also an interaction indicating a decreased connectivity pattern in the RUM condition and/or increased connectivity pattern in the ABS condition in the HCAS group in comparison to the LCAS group between part of the mPFC, part of the DMN, and R-Heschl’s gyrus, insular cortex, and R-planum temporale, which have been shown to be engaged in auditory ( ) and language ( ;  ) processing. These results are also consistent with diminished resting state connectivity in Heschl’s gyrus and the planum temporale in high trait-anxiety participants ( ). Taking into account that Heschl’s gyrus is engaged in both task-elicited and spontaneous inner speech ( ), it may be hypothesized that the disrupted connectivity of the DMN, mPFC in this case, and parts of auditory and language circuitries reflects the tendency for repetitive negative thinking typical of HCAS participants ( ). \n\nThese results may not only serve as evidence for difficulty in down-regulating DMN activity in HCAS subjects during ruminative and abstract thinking, but also suggest a more global pattern of functional connectivity during various types of thinking and diminished cognitive control ( ). This conclusion is supported by higher amplitudes of changes in connectivity between conditions in the HCAS group in comparison to the control group (see beta values in  ). Different patterns of connectivity in the more cognitively demanding ABS condition between groups also suggests that high levels of CAS may be associated with disturbances in the performance of cognitive tasks observed in clinical groups ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), which is in line with the S-REF model and the metacognitive theory of psychological disorders ( ;  ). \n\nThe described results are also in line with those showing connectivity disruptions in rsfMRI and task-based fMRI in MDD patients ( ;  ;  ) and anxiety disorder patients ( ;  ). This suggests that clinical levels of psychopathology and clinical diagnoses may not be necessary to observe disrupted patterns of functional connectivity in the brain. High levels of CAS may serve as an underlying factor not only for the symptoms observed in various clinical afflictions, but also can be associated with corresponding patterns of neural functioning. \n\n\n### Resting State Functional Connectivity \n  \nIn the current study, we also examined functional connectivity from brain activity recorded during a 10-min-long resting state fMRI procedure. We found the HCAS group to be characterized by stronger connectivity between several brain regions as compared to the LCAS group. First, the HCAS group showed stronger functional connectivity between the posterior part of the insula, a region involved, inter alia, in emotional processing during memory retrieval ( ) and part of the opercular cortex in the left hemisphere, which is associated with auditory imagery ( ). This pattern of connectivity could reflect the process of repetitive negative thinking occurring in the HCAS group – with interplay between parts of brain associated with emotion processing during memory retrieval ( ) and verbal imagery. Increased connectivity was also found between the R-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is associated with working memory and a part of the CEN ( ), and medial parts of the occipital lobe cortex associated with word recognition and processing ( ) and visual processing ( ). Perhaps this increased connectivity may reflect common activations of these structures on a daily basis during the frequent rumination, worry, and reflection of the participants in the HCAS group. This is consistent with the results of the questionnaires they filled-in immediately before the fMRI study. It is noteworthy that diminished, not increased, connectivity was found between frontal and occipital brain regions in patients with social anxiety disorder ( ). This result was interpreted by the authors as disrupted processing of visual stimuli in social contexts. Similarly, our results may suggest that CAS is an underlying factor of the heightened salience of threatening social cues in social anxiety disorder. This calls for investigation in further studies, as the results of this and other studies are mixed. \n\nThere was also a pattern of decreased connectivity found in the HCAS group as compared to the control group. This pattern was observed between part of the ACC and part of the ventral frontal pole which, again, are parts of the salience and CENs, respectively. Disruption in this connection was found in patients with GAD and interpreted as a dysfunction of top-down control over emotion regulation ( ). In general, the obtained results can be understood as altered interplay between different brain networks in people with high levels of CAS. Similar abnormalities were reported in studies on different clinical disorders such as depression ( ;  ;  ) and social anxiety ( ;  ). This points to CAS as a probable factor underlying the clinical symptomatology and disrupted neural functional connectivity in people with different clinical afflictions, or even in people without a current diagnosis but with a high risk of developing emotional disorders. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the neural correlates of CAS. In this study we showed that treatment- and diagnosis-naive people with high levels of CAS differ substantially from people with low levels of this syndrome on various psychopathology and affect measures. Nearly half of the HCAS group was diagnosed with at least one current psychiatric disorder, predominantly mood and anxiety disorders as well as PTSD. We also demonstrated a large difference in self-assessment in these groups during repeated induction of negative thinking. These serve as proof-of-concept results of the metacognitive theory of emotional disorders ( ). Contrary to our first hypothesis, we had no success in replicating rumination induction results in depressed participants ( ), for which there may be methodological and theoretical reasons. Irrespective of previous results, we demonstrated that neuronal activity during negative thinking is strongly related to neural activation of the DMN and that brain activity patterns during abstract thinking resemble the CEN. We were able to demonstrate evidence for our two hypotheses regarding differences in functional connectivity between groups. We showed, that low- and high-CAS groups differed in measures of functional connectivity during rumination and worry as well as during abstract thinking and resting state fMRI: high levels of CAS were related to disrupted patterns of connectivity within and between various brain networks – the DMN, the salience network, and the CEN. Overall, our results suggest that people with high levels of CAS tend to have disrupted neural processing in the areas of self-referential, task-oriented, and emotional processing. The obtained results are broadly analogous to results obtained in fMRI studies of different clinical groups with mood, anxiety, and PTSDs, which serves as an argument for recognizing high levels of CAS as an underlying factor of emotional disorders and their neural correlates. These results are consistent with the theoretical underpinnings of the metacognitive theory of psychopathology, suggesting a common mechanism of emotional disorders originating in CAS and laying the foundations for further exploration of neural correlates of CAS. Future studies should use different, better-established fMRI paradigms and more differentiated groups, such as people with high levels of CAS with and without clinical diagnoses. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nJK, MW, AM, and MD wrote the manuscript.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) is increasingly being used to characterize functional connectivity in the brain. Despite mixed results to date and multiple methodological challenges, dominant hypotheses implicate hyperconnectivity across brain networks in patients with ADHD, which could be the target of pharmacological treatments. We describe the experience and results of the Clínica Universidad de Navarra (Spain) Metilfenidato (CUNMET) pilot study. CUNMET tested the feasibility of identifying R-fMRI markers of clinical response in children with ADHD undergoing naturalistical pharmacological treatments. We analyzed cross-sectional data from 56 patients with ADHD (18 treated with methylphenidate, 18 treated with lisdexamfetamine, and 20 treatment-naive patients). Standard preprocessing and statistical analyses with attention to control for head motion and correction for multiple comparisons were performed. The only results that survived correction were noted in contrasts of children who responded clinically to lisdexamfetamine after long-term treatment vs. treatment-naive patients. In these children, we observed stronger negative correlations (anticorrelations) across nodes in six brain networks, which is consistent with higher across-network functional segregation in patients treated with lisdexamfetamine, i.e., less inter-network interference than in treatment-naive patients. We also note the lessons learned, which could help those pursuing clinically relevant multidisciplinary research in ADHD en route to eventual personalized medicine. To advance reproducible open science, our report is accompanied with links providing access to our data and analytic scripts. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 5–10% of children and adolescents ( ) and persisting into adulthood in about half of cases ( ). Pharmacological treatments address the core symptoms of ADHD; long-term benefits in functional outcomes, though questioned, are documented ( ). However, predicting which medication will show the best efficacy and tolerability for any given individual is not feasible. Thus, current medication management consists of trial and error titration ( ). \n\nNeuroimaging research in mental disorders, including ADHD, aims to elucidate the pathophysiology and neuropsychopharmacology of these conditions and their treatments in a quest for personalized medicine ( ). Yet, despite a growing literature and increasing methodological sophistication, neuroimaging is still unable to inform “bedside” clinical decisions ( ). \n\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) has become a mainstream brain imaging technique. It highlights the statistical properties of spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals to infer “functional connectivity” among spatially distant areas which represent putative brain functional networks ( ). \n\nR-fMRI research in ADHD has identified widespread brain circuitry differences between patients and typically-developing control individuals (TDCs) and their possible normalization with medications; however, results have been inconsistent across studies ( ,  ). Challenges to the validity and reproducibility of neuroimaging findings include insufficient control of in-scanner head motion, excessive false positive rates from inadequate control for multiple statistical comparisons, small sample size, lack of thorough reporting of methods and results and lack of open sharing of study data ( ). Furthermore, research in neuroimaging and medication in ADHD has frequently used experimental treatment designs which are less relevant to finding the brain correlates of real-life treatment patterns ( ). \n\n\n## The CUNMET Study \n  \nThe “Clínica Universidad de Navarra Metilfenidato” (CUNMET) study was designed as a proof-of-concept study in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Ph.D. [see also ( ,  )]. The study was based at the child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient service at Clínica Universidad de Navarra, a tertiary university hospital in the north of Spain. \n\nCUNMET's overarching objective was to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a naturalistic neuroimaging study with a clinical sample of children and adolescents with ADHD, with the aim of exploring putative R-fMRI correlates of differential symptomatic response to stimulant medications. Specific objectives were: (1) To obtain phenotypic (i.e., demographic, clinical), neuropsychological, and R-fMRI data from a cross-sectional sample of children and adolescents with ADHD with differential pharmacological responses to stimulants and a longitudinal subsample of treatment-naive patients evaluated pre- and post-treatment; (2) to conduct rigorous and transparent methods to minimize the effects of imaging artifacts, in particular, head motion and false-positive rates, in the exploration of neural correlates of treatment response; (3) to explore reliable R-fMRI differences in whole-brain network correlations across treatment-response groups and treatment-naive patients, as well as the modulation of these correlations after treatment with methylphenidate in treatment-naive patients; (4) to transparently describe the challenges encountered and the limitations of the study; and (5) to contribute to open-science efforts through best practices in reporting and data sharing. \n\nDetailed information on methods is available in  . Our study included boys and girls aged 7–17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD based on DSM-5 criteria ( ), falling into one of four groups: (1) patients who responded well to an extended-release formulation of methylphenidate (MPH) as the first-line treatment and were taking MPH; (2) patients who had not responded to MPH and responded to extended-release lisdexamfetamine (LDX) as second-line treatment and were taking LDX; (3) patients who had not responded to either MPH or LDX and responded to extended-release guanfacine (GFC) as the third treatment; and (4) patients who had not started medications when recruited (NAIVE). A subset of patients in the NAIVE group were invited into a longitudinal prospective pre- vs. post-treatment analysis after undergoing treatment with MPH. Clinical response was defined by either a reduction of at least 30% in parent-reported ADHD rating scale ( ) or substantial improvement in Clinical Global Impression ( ) after at least 3 months of the corresponding treatment. Main exclusion criteria were diagnosis of comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders and/or use of medication for symptoms of such disorders (with the exception of oppositional defiant disorder, headaches, and insomnia) and contraindications for MRI. The study had the corresponding ethical approvals, and participation was voluntary and required a written informed consent from the parents and assent from the patients. \n\nAfter consent and assent were obtained along with clinical assessments that confirmed inclusion/exclusion criteria were met, R-fMRI data were acquired with a Siemens MAGNETOM 3.0 Tesla Skyra (Siemens; Erlangen, Germany) with a Siemens 32-channel head coil. Each scan session lasted around 20 min and consisted of a R-fMRI echo planar imaging BOLD sequence (total duration = 8.41 min, eyes open, TR = 2,020 ms, TE = 30 ms, 36 slices, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3.5 mm, Field of View = 192 mm, flip angle = 80°, 250 volumes, matrix = 64 × 64), a perfusion-weighted ASL sequence (not further described here) and an anatomical T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (total duration = 5:12 min, TR = 2,300 ms, TE = 2.96 ms, number of blocks = 1, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.1 mm, field of view = 256 mm, flip angle = 9°, slices per block = 176, imaging matrix = 256 × 256). \n\nBriefly, preprocessing and quality control of images used the Configurable Pipeline for Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC, v.1.6.2a) ( ) which included skullstripping, segmentation, spatial normalization of anatomical images, slice timing correction, functional-to-anatomical registration, spatial normalization, nuisance signal correction (with CompCor ( ), ICA-AROMA ( ) and scrubbing of volumes with more than 0.3 mm of framewise displacement, independent component analysis denoising, and median angle correction), band-pass filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz), spatial smoothing [full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel of 6 mm], and Z-scoring of functional image time series. \n\nAnalyses were conducted at two levels of spatial resolution. Dual regression of the Smith et al. 10-network parcellation (medial visual, occipital pole visual, lateral visual, default mode, cerebellum, sensorimotor, auditory, executive control, and right and left frontoparietal) ( ) were used to extract time series of preprocessed data; we also used regions-of-interest from the Schaefer et al. 200-node parcellation ( ) which overlap with the Yeo et al. 17-network parcellation (visual A&B, somatomotor A&B, temporal-parietal, dorsal attention A&B, salience-ventral attention A&B, frontoparietal control A-C, default mode A-C, limbic A&B) ( ). Connectivity graphs were calculated for each individual and later used for group statistical analyses. \n\nDescriptive and comparative statistics of relevant phenotypic data consisted of across-group tests, conducted with STATA v.12.0 (StataCorp. 2011.   Stata Statistical Software: Release 12  . College Station, TX: StataCorp LP.,  ). Group comparisons of neuroimaging graphs were performed using the Network-Based Statistic (NBS) Toolbox ( ) ( ). Multiple comparisons were corrected through False Discovery Rate (FDR). Statistical significance was set at   p   < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons. The contrasts were: \n  \n(a) Stimulant-treated vs. untreated (merged MPH + LDX groups vs. naive). \n  \n(b) MPH-treated vs. untreated (MPH vs. naive). \n  \n(c) LDX-treated vs. untreated (LDX vs. naive). \n  \n(d) MPH-treated vs. LDX-treated (MPH vs. naive). \n  \nWe recruited a sample of 68 participants, who provided a total of 76 scans (21 MPH patients, 21 LDX, 3 GFC, and 23 naive; 8 Treatment-naive patients were scanned pre- and post-MPH treatment). This distribution deviated from the original plan (  N   = 80; 20/group): first, GFC participants were difficult to recruit, due to the relative paucity of non-responders to stimulants in our clinic and their higher likelihood of presenting exclusion criteria; second, we were only able to obtain a post-treatment scan and evaluation in eight naive patients prior to the termination of the study at the end of the principal investigator's residency. Due to insufficient recruitment, the three GFC participants were excluded from analyses. Similarly, the eight post-treatment scans from the subgroup of naive participants who were assessed pre- and post-MPH were also excluded; instead, resources were shifted to slightly increase the samples in the MPH, LDX, and naive groups. Difficulties encountered in the recruitment process, in general, were: (a) logistical, such as scheduling issues for MRI scans due to limited scanner availability and scheduling difficulties for patients and families, many of whom lived far from the hospital; (b) constraints related to the research design, such as exclusion criteria and the challenges of complying with complex procedures on the day of scanning. \n\nIn addition, 9 participants were excluded from analyses after image quality control (7 due to excessive head motion, 1 due to a marked acquisition artifact, and 1 due to large anatomical anomalies). This led to a final sample of 56 retained participants, relatively evenly distributed across the MPH, LDX, and naive groups. \n\n shows the key sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the analyzed sample, and two quality control metrics: head motion data and amount of imaging data removed per group. \n  \nCUNMET included sample - key phenotypic characteristics. \n  \n Table of key phenotypic (sociodemographic, clinical) and imaging quality control characteristics across groups, in the sample of participants included in the imaging analyses.

( ) detected 30 pairs of functional connectivity which exceeded the 5% FDR threshold in at least one of the 859 simulations. All of these occurred exclusively in the contrast between LDX and NAIVE groups. Assuming that many of these nominally significant results likely represent false positives, we focus on the eight correlations that emerged in at least 5% of the simulations.   displays the 12 brain nodes involved in these eight pairs. They represented 10 distinct brain regions, identified with their corresponding Yeo et al. ( ) networks. The nodes were predominantly located in the right hemisphere and mainly involved the frontoparietal control, attention, and default mode networks, although the somatomotor and visual networks were also represented. The box plots of average functional connectivity show that the LDX group had lower average functional connectivity in each pair than the NAIVE group; specifically, while the average functional connectivity values in these eight pairs in the NAIVE group were around zero, they were negative (i.e., anticorrelated) in the LDX group.

Conducting this study was an explicit learning process. The research team was aware of the main methodological threats of R-fMRI research: small sample sizes, poor data quality due to signal artifacts [in particular, head motion ( ), which is greater in children with ADHD], high false positive rates [reflecting insufficiently stringent correction for multiple comparisons ( )], excessive analytic flexibility ( ), and lack of replicability of published research due to deficiencies in reporting ( ). As the field has started to confront these problems, best practices in study reporting and transparency have been developed ( ). In response, publicly-funded multicenter endeavors [such as ENIGMA ( ) and ABCD ( )] are creating large sample sizes. In this admittedly small pilot study, we opted for stringent quality control (especially in terms of head motion corrections and exclusions), conservative statistical analyses, and transparent reporting. \n\nGiven the limitations of this study, all of our results have to be considered preliminary. In particular, we cannot be confident regarding the null results in the comparisons involving the MPH group. The greater similarity in functional connectivity patterns between the MPH group and the NAIVE group than the LDX group is surprising, as the neuropharmacological and clinical effects of MPH and LDX, both stimulants, are similar. We note a lack of R-fMRI research comparing methylphenidate vs. amphetamines ( ) so cannot comment further. \n\nOur preliminary results showed strengthened negative correlations (anticorrelations) across pairs of brain regions corresponding to different networks in children with ADHD who responded clinically to LDX after long-term treatment, when contrasted to treatment-naive patients. This finding is consistent with higher across-network functional segregation in patients treated with LDX, suggesting that distinct brain networks were operating with less interference from other networks than in treatment-naive patients. Such an increase in across-network functional segregation could be a neural correlate of positive clinical response to LDX in patients with ADHD. Due to the cross-sectional design and the lack of a healthy comparison sample, we cannot ascertain whether these differences between groups reflected pre-post medication changes, were markers of medication intake, mediators between medication intake and clinical response, or rather adaptive changes after clinical response. \n\nThe overall tentative findings, involving diverse combinations of nodes from six different networks, are compatible with systems neuroscience approaches that highlight the role of functional network segregation in health and disease. In these models, increasing segregation reflects efficient network functioning and excessive integration can be a correlate of brain dysfunction ( ). If excessive cross-network functional integration were confirmed to be a consistent feature of ADHD and related neuropsychiatric disorders, it could represent a therapeutic target of medications. \n\n\n## Lessons Learned \n  \nIn terms of study design, the naturalistic approach, further constrained by difficulties encountered during its execution, has a limited ability to differentiate true pharmacological effects from other potential confounders, and in this sense is inferior to randomized controlled trials ( ). However, this design is better suited for examining “real world” treatment responses. In addition, our cross-sectional analyses did not allow us to confirm whether across-group differences reflected true medication-induced changes. Finally, the lack of TDC individuals prevented us from formulating any tentative conclusions about the potential “normalizing” effect of medications reported in some previous studies ( ) (i.e., disappearance of neuroimaging statistical differences between patients with ADHD and TDC when patients are on treatment). Nevertheless, as noted elsewhere, claims of “normalization” should be considered with caution ( ). \n\nAnother major limitation was the limited sample size, even if it was in line with that of most previous studies ( ). Small sizes have been endemic in neuroimaging research of ADHD ( ,  ), and medication studies present further logistical complications for recruitment and retention of participants. This is partially offset by the within-subject analyses which increase statistical power relative to cross-sectional designs ( ). \n\nWe adopted a naturalistic design with relatively broad inclusion criteria reflecting the patients with ADHD seen in our clinic. Thus, we recruited a sample encompassing a wide age range (7–17 years), both sexes, right and left-handed individuals, and allowed certain comorbidities (learning disabilities, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety and mood symptoms and sub-diagnostic threshold autistic traits). This approach contrasts with previous studies which had narrower age ranges and/or excluded females ( ). The down-side of our more inclusive approach is greater heterogeneity, which also decreases statistical power. \n\nOther study limitations included inconsistencies in demographic and clinical data collected, the specific naturalistic medication scheme (which reflected clinical practice in one center), lack of mock-scanning training sessions, lack of real time monitoring of wakefulness and head motion, and flexibility of analytic pipelines (outlined in  ) due to the exploratory nature of this study and PhD candidate training purposes. \n\nThe analytic approach was robust to limit the effects of head motion and false-positive rates, two key issues in neuroimaging research of ADHD ( ), and the whole-brain network-based analyses afforded a big-picture perspective of brain functioning that transcends the study of isolated regions or networks. The statistically-salient results, along with the statistical uncertainty of their robustness, are transparently reported. \n\nOur experience conducting the CUNMET study, with its successes, shortcomings, and preliminary results may be relevant for the design of future research in this area. We provide specific recommendations in five domains: \n  \n Study design:   Design prospective naturalistic studies to assess pre vs. post-treatment changes in medication-naive patients with ADHD, optimally with a comparison group of TDC individuals scanned twice. Account for the potential effects of age/development on treatment responses and its brain correlates ( ). Sample sizes of at least 50/group would improve statistical power and reproducibility ( ). \n  \n Participant assessment and data collection:   Ensure systematic collection of clinical, sociodemographic, and neuropsychological data in naturalistic settings. Use standard clinical assessments in initial visits and follow-ups. Conduct a thorough medication history for each patient. \n  \n Image acquisition:   Include training (mock) scanning sessions to habituate participants to the experience. Optimize head immobilization tools. Monitor real-time wakefulness and head motion. Record any incidents during the session. Increase the total duration of BOLD sequence data to at least 25 min ( ), by combining movie watching or tasks. \n  \n Imaging and statistical analyses:   Conduct thorough quality control soon after obtaining each image. Perform rigorous nuisance and head motion corrections, and include whole-brain metrics. Consistently correct for multiple comparisons. Discuss the rationale and potential limitations of the selected methods. \n  \n Transparency and reporting, and open science:   Prospectively register the study protocol, including the data analysis plan, in online platforms such as the Open Science Framework ( ), and report relevant changes from the initial protocol. Follow the Organization for the Human Brain Mapping - Best Practices in data analysis and sharing in neuroimaging using MRI (OHBM-COBIDAS) ( ) to thoroughly report methods and results. Ask prospectively for permission from participants to share their deidentified data with the scientific community. Share deidentified data and full analytic scripts in online repositories. \n  \nIn conclusion, the CUNMET study constituted a fruitful proof-of-concept of state-of-the-art neuropsychopharmacological research in ADHD. Despite substantial shortcomings, we demonstrated the feasibility of a naturalistic design within the constraints of real-time clinical practice and a training program, and our findings suggest that potential brain correlates of clinical response to lisdexamfetamine in children and adolescents are based in across-network segregation. The lessons learned from CUNMET are offered to inform future research and to encourage prospective investigators to undertake transparent, open-science collaborative efforts. While similar individual small studies will not advance the field on their own, their aggregation may offer frameworks for efficient exploration of designs, methods, and potential biomarkers ( ) in the quest for personalized medicine in ADHD. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

Generative models that simulate this network activity, called brain network models (BNM), are able to reproduce global averaged properties of empirical rs-fMRI activity such as functional connectivity (FC) but perform poorly in reproducing unique trajectories and state transitions that are observed over the span of minutes in whole-brain data (Cabral, Kringelbach, & Deco,  ; Kashyap & Keilholz,  ). The manuscript demonstrates that by using recurrent neural networks, it can fit the BNM in a novel way to the rs-fMRI data and predict large amounts of variance between subsequent measures of rs-fMRI data. Simulated data also contain unique repeating trajectories observed in rs-fMRI, called quasiperiodic patterns (QPP), that span 20 s and complex state transitions observed using k-means analysis on windowed FC matrices (Allen et al.,  ; Majeed et al.,  ).

However, it has been difficult to compare the complex brain activity obtained from simulations with empirical data. Previous studies have used simple metrics to characterize coordination between regions such as functional connectivity. In this manuscript, we extend this work by utilizing modern machine learning techniques to fit the brain network models to observed data and train on the mismatch between the model and observed signal. Our results show that our system training on these new metrics generalizes to a system that is able to reproduce trajectories and complex state transitions seen in rs-fMRI over the span of minutes. Our results will be useful in constraining and developing more realistic simulations of whole-brain activity. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nOver the past decade, our understanding of spontaneous whole-brain activity and coordination between brain regions has largely been obtained through noninvasive resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies (Biswal, Yetkin, Haughton, & Hyde,  ; Margulies et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ; Zalesky, Fornito, Cocchi, Gollo, & Breakspear,  ). Resting state, a state without an explicit task or stimulus, has surprisingly complex whole-brain   that are well structured and highly dependent on the previous brain activity (Allen et al.,  ; Billings et al.,  ; Shakil, Lee, & Keilholz,  ; Zalesky et al.,  ). Current generative models such as   models ( ) attempt to characterize-whole brain activity as the interaction between a single neural population and the activity of its network neighbors defined by its structural fiber connections as measured through diffusion tensor imaging (Cabral, Hugues, Sporns, & Deco,  ; Honey et al.,  ). Although there are many variants of the model that use different sets of differential equations to describe the activity at each node, all brain network models heavily rely on the description of the   through which they interact (Sanz-Leon, Knock, Spiegler, & Jirsa,  ). \n\nLong simulations of brain network models, starting from random initial conditions, are able reproduce time-averaged properties of rs-fMRI. These properties such as average   (FC) are defined as the correlation between brain regions over long periods of simulated time greater than 10 min (Cabral et al.,  ). The time-averaged properties are thought to be more related to the structural network and are thus able to be reproduced by many different BNMs since they all share the structural network as an input (Cabral et al.,  ; Kashyap & Keilholz,  ; Skudlarski et al.,  ). However, the BNMs are worse and more variable at reproducing transient dynamic features that occur at shorter timescales, on the order of seconds and minutes, which are much more dependent on the exact description of the differential equations (Cabral et al.,  ; Kashyap & Keilholz,  ). Since BNMs are not synchronized with actual measurements, there exists a gap in understanding how much these models are able to capture the actual changes to fMRI signal between measurements. \n\nWe propose a novel method synchronizing the BNMs to empirical data using   (RNNs) in order to learn the initial state of the BNM from measured rs-fMRI data. Then using a Euler integration scheme, we can use the differential equations from the BNM to predict the next rs-fMRI data point and then evaluate directly how well it compares against the next measured time point. By applying this technique, brain network autoencoder (BNA), we can quantify how much of the variance of future resting-state activity can be accounted for from previous brain activity using RNNs with BNM constraints as opposed to other sources that influence large brain activity such as external stimuli. This approach of using RNNs with constraints in order to model biological systems has been recently gaining attention as a efficient tool in solving for and modeling unknown systems of differential equations. The approach combines the power of machine learning and allows for the incorporation of known biological variables that allow for interpretation on how the signal evolves (Chen, Rubanova, Bettencourt, & Duvenaud,  ; Pandarinath et al.,  ). Moreover, the approach has an advantage over traditional methods fitting parameters of the BNM, which simulate over a large parameter space and then use time-averaged measures such as FC for model selection. Rather, the mismatch between the model empirical signal at every time step is fed into the machine learning system to fit model to the data. This approach might also help distinguish between different variants of BNMs as it provides a useful measure in evaluating their performance on short time predictions, as they are all able to produce time-averaged measures as average FC (Cabral et al.,  ). \n\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of our model in its accuracy of short-term predictions (< 5 s) that are synchronized to the empirical data and the dynamic properties of the simulated signal over long time intervals (>10 min). In order to train our model, we used fMRI scans from 407 Human Connectome subjects (Van Essen et al.,  ) reduced to 66 regions of interest (ROI) according to the Desikan-Killiany atlas (Desikan et al.,  ). The corresponding structural connectivity to the Desikan-Killiany atlas was estimated using tractrography on five HCP subjects (Kashyap & Keilholz,  ). After we trained the model, we then evaluate our model on a set of 40 unseen subjects and over 1,000 different initializations to see how well the system generalizes from the training set in order to produce correct predictions on unseen brain activity. We test two variants of this model that have different latent states, the firing rate and the Wilson-Cowan model, in order to see whether this method can distinguish the performance between different variants of brain network models (Cabral, Hugues, Kringelbach, & Deco,  ; Deco, Jirsa, McIntosh, Sporns, & Kötter,  ). We utilize an autoregressive model as a null model to compare our effectiveness on short-term predictions. A similar linear variant (general linear model) is currently being used to distinguish the activity between rest and task blocks and regress out resting-state activity in order to infer task networks (Smith et al.,  ). \n\nWe test long periods of simulations of our generative model using   in a similar manner currently used for evaluating traditional BNM (Kashyap & Keilholz,  ), in order to see whether it can reproduce dynamic properties observed in rs-fMRI that repeat over minutes. We utilize the k-means analysis on short-windowed FCs that looks for structure in the signal in the timescale of around a minute, and a quasiperiodic pattern (QPP) technique that searches for a 20-s repeating pattern. We use a traditional firing rate model as a null model to compare against the long instantiations of BNAs. \n\nThe BNA method offers three main strengths in comparison with other methods that are currently used to simulate whole-brain signals:   \nIt solves the problem of comparing simulated and empirical data without using time-averaged metrics such as average FC, by directly using real data to initialize the model and by measuring differences in the predicted transient dynamics on a moment-to-moment basis. \n  \nIt allows us to use black-box machine learning techniques while simultaneously estimating interpretable latent variables such as firing rate or excitatory and inhibitory currents that can be verified using multimodal recordings. \n  \nIn long simulations of the BNA, the simulated signal exhibits dynamic properties seen in empirical rs-fMRI that occur over a timescale of minutes, which are not reproducible using traditional BNM techniques. \n  \n\nTherefore, we believe that the brain network autoencoder will be a useful tool to help us understand brain dynamics at the macroscale level. \n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### One-Time-Step Prediction \n  \nThe   is trained to predict one time step in advance. In this section we show how the signal is reproduced across 66 regions starting from the input, then projected onto the latent space representing the initial conditions of the BNM, and finally integrated to predict the next time step. In  , we present the results of predicting the next time step from the previous time step for the two different variants of BNA, the firing rate model and the Wilson-Cowan model. Although both are able to reproduce the spatio temporal signal as shown in   (middle top and middle bottom), they differ in the latent or hidden variables used to represent the transitions. For the firing rate BNA, the measured data are projected into a space with firing rate as the hidden variable for each region, as can be seen in   (right top). The latent variable time series has a high degree of similarity to the original signal (correlation > 0.9) shown in  , top right. The latent state is then passed onto the BNM, which integrates it according to the firing rate model to predict the next time-step. The traces of the input, output, and latent state for a single ROI are shown in   (left top). For the Wilson-Cowan model,   (bottom row), the latent state is represented by two variables, the excitatory and the inhibitory currents, and their interaction through the Wilson-Cowan model produces the next rs-fMRI time step. The excitatory current is positively correlated with the measured signal and the inhibitory current is negatively correlated with the signal, although both to lesser degrees than the firing rate model. The models perform relatively similarly in predicting one time step in front and are able to reproduce the input signal with an   R   of 0.95 averaged across all areas. \n  \nOne-step prediction. Two different Brain Network Autoencoders are able to reproduce the next time step from the previous time step. The autoencoder takes as input the measured signal (leftmost) at time step   t   and outputs the predicted (second from left) signal at   t   + 1. The autoencoder projects the input into a space constrained by the brain network model equations (middle panel), which are represented as the state variables in the firing rate model (firing rate) or the Wilson-Cowan model (excitatory and inhibitory currents), and then are integrated to produce the predicted output. The plots represent a 3D contour plot where the x-axis represents time, the y-axis represents the different 66 ROIs, and the color represents the intensity that has been z-scored (see fMRI data subsection in the   section). The rightmost panel shows the time series of a single ROI for the input (rs-fMRI), output (estimated), and latent state (firing rate or excitatory/inhibitory currents). At one time step the accuracy in terms of   R   across all ROIs is on average 0.95. \n  \n\n### Multiple-Time-Step Prediction \n  \nThe sequential autoencoder can also predict multiple steps into the future by recursively feeding the predicted output in as the next input. The performance of multi-time-step forecasting is shown in   (top left), where the averaged   R   across a test and a subset of the training data of the same size for both BNA variants are compared with a naive variant of the autoregressive model that assumes the next time point is the previous time point (see  ). The autoregressive model is similar to the current approach used to differentiate task from rest signals, namely the generalized linear model, which uses the time steps before task activation as a regressor to remove the resting-state activity from task responses (Smith et al.,  ). The generalized linear and the autoregressive model resting state as a constant baseline that does not change over time. Although the autoregressive performs as well as the BNA for the first time point, the BNA is able to reproduce the first three time steps with an   R   of around 0.9 or higher, as opposed to autoregressive model which is only greater than 0.9 for the first time step. The test and training performance is relatively similar for the autoencoders, only when all the parameters are set correctly and the network is not over- or undertrained (see  ,  , for more detail). \n  \nError across multi-step prediction. Top left: Accuracy of our generative model in synthesizing the first few time points. The accuracy of the firing rate and Wilson-Cowan models are compared on training and test datasets and with the autoregressive model. The error compounds and gradually increases until the model diverges completely from the measured signal around 10 s and continues along its own dynamics (top right). The accuracy over time for the Wilson-Cowan and firing rate training overlap, as both models do about as well as each other on training data. Bottom left: Histogram of   R   for each individual in test and train datasets shows that it generalizes across individuals. Bottom right: The mean squared error (MSE) for each region of interest (ROI) in predicting the first time step. The MSE is used here to compare differences across ROIs, because it was the error that was used to train the system and is more reproducible across instantiations. \n  \nCharacteristic of autoencoders, the error compounds at every time step, because the previous errors are propagated to the next time step. This causes the model to completely diverge by 10 s from the measured signal, as shown in  , top right. The bottom left panel in   also shows that the BNA generalizes across individuals, as the histogram of the errors is roughly the same for all the individuals in the training or the testing dataset. The two different BNA variants, the firing rate and the Wilson-Cowan, are similar in performance as seen in the top right of  , with the Wilson-Cowan having on average a higher   R   on the test dataset. The BNA does not perform equally in predicting each of the ROI time series. It predicts certain regions with a higher accuracy than the others. The mean squared error per each ROI for the first time step is shown in  , bottom right. The mean squared error was used here instead of   R  , because the network was trained to minimize this gradient during training and most accurately represents the performance on each ROI. The error was largest in the ROIs in the temporal lobe, namely the entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and the temporal pole. These regions are the least connected to the rest of the network and more connected with subcortical regions, which have not been included in the simulations (Cabral et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Analysis of Long Simulations \n  \nIn order to assess properties of the simulated signal at longer periods, the BNA was used to generate 1,000 time points or 12 min of data. Properties of longer simulations of BNA were compared with those of the empirical signal. In  , the average functional connectivity and the power spectrum of the empirical and the BNA as well as a traditional firing rate BNM are compared. The traditional BNM FC has a weak correlation with the empirical FC (0.35) and is in the range of most traditional methods (0.3–0.6; Cabral et al.,  ; Kashyap & Keilholz,  ; Sanz-Leon et al.,  ; Senden, Reuter, van den Heuvel, Goebel, & Deco,  ). The BNA performs much better at reproducing the detailed relationship between ROIs seen in FC, compared with the traditional model where groups of ROIs are synchronized over long periods of time, causing blocky patches in the FC when the ROIs are ordered by highly connected subgraphs (Cabral et al.,  ; Kashyap & Keilholz,  ). The FC of the BNA has a high correlation of 0.83 (firing rate) and 0.7 (Wilson-Cowan) to the actual measured signal. The spectral power of the empirical and the simulated signal is indistinguishable in the range of 0.01 to 0.125 Hz, and has the characteristic 1/f linear slope of around 0.9. The traditional BNM has less temporal structure and is relatively flat over the lower frequency compared with all the other models and the empirical signal (Kashyap & Keilholz,  ). At higher frequencies the model tends to produce much higher levels of noise than the empirical signal and the traditional BNM, both of which have already been filtered in the preprocessing steps. Before analyzing the simulated signal with dynamical analysis techniques, we therefore filtered it at 0.125 Hz to minimize the high frequency power that would interfere with the dynamic analysis algorithms. \n  \nAverage functional connectivity and power spectrum. Comparison of average functional connectivity from empirical rs-fMRI (top left), BNA firing rate (top left middle), BNA Wilson-Cowan (top right middle), and a traditional firing rate BNM (top right). The simulated FC matrices have a high degree of correlation (0.7–0.85) with the empirical FC, unlike the traditional BNM that have a correlation of 0.5 (bottom left). Each axis in the FC plots represents the regions in the ROI that are shown on the right. The frequency spectrum (bottom right) of the BNA follows that of the empirical signal exactly except at the higher frequencies (> 0.125 Hz), where the simulated signal has much larger power. The traditional brain network model has less structure in the frequency range (0.01–0.1 Hz) and has equal power in most of the range compared with the rs-fMRI and the BNA models. The traditional BNM and the empirical signal also have been filtered at 0.125 Hz, while the BNA models are not. \n  \nWe also analyzed the simulated signal for unique trajectories known as quasiperiodic patterns (QPP), which could also be considered a limit cycle (Majeed et al.,  ). Limit cycles are a property unique to nonlinear systems, and reproducing such a property would mean that the generative model reproduces some of the dynamics features of rs-fMRI despite its divergence from measured signals. In   we have plotted the QPP for the rs-fMRI signal (top left), a traditional generative firing rate BNM model (bottom left), and both of the BNA variants (top middle and right). The empirical QPP involves a 20 s trajectory that switches from task positive networks (first half of the template) to the more internal or default mode networks of the brain (second half of the template; Majeed et al.,  ). After phase adjusting the templates, the maximum correlation of the firing rate BNA QPP was 0.75 and the Wilson-Cowan BNA QPP was 0.43 to the original template. This is very different from the traditional dynamics seen in BNM (bottom left), which produce blocky limit cycles of clusters of nodes that are highly synchronized together and activating together. The BNA produces QPP that are highly structured spatially and temporally. The correlation between the QPP template and the signal is plotted in the bottom middle, where certain time points show a high degree of correlation to the trajectory in the QPP template. Thresholding at 95% significance, the occurrence of these QPP is around 1.3 times a minute in the rs-fMRI data. The BNA models have similar rates, where the firing rate BNA has an occurrence of 1.19 times a minute. The firing rate brain network model shows more variance in the number of QPP cycles per minute (bottom middle,  ). \n  \nQPP template comparison. Comparison of the different QPP templates is shown in the top row between measured data (top left), the brain network autoencoders (BNA; top middle and right), and the older BNM (bottom left). The QPP templates represent a unique 18-s trajectory of all the ROIs (y-axis) that repeats itself on average 1.3 times per minute (bottom middle). The rs-fMRI signal is highly correlated with the template during specific time points in its trajectory, as seen in the distribution of correlations to the template (bottom right). The Wilson-Cowan and the firing rate BNA have similar distributions, while the BNM template is least correlated with its own data. The firing rate BNA QPP is the closest to the empirical QPP (correlation 0.73) and occurs roughly 1.19 times per minute. The Wilson-Cowan BNA QPP occurs a little faster, around 1.4 times a minute, and has a correlation of 0.43 with the original template. The older BNM QPP is more of an on-off trajectory and does not have the intricate delays and temporal structure as seen in the QPP of the empirical signal or the BNA models. \n  \nAnother property of rs-fMRI that has been studied is the existence of brain states, which can be described as large scale patterns of functional organization that are stable over the span on the order of around 40 s (Allen et al.,  ; Liu & Duyn,  ).The brain transitions through these states over time (Allen et al.,  ). Algorithms such as k-Means have typically identified six or seven states. We applied k-Means clustering on short-windowed functional connectivity matrices (50 s) to find these states in the simulated data (see methods for more detail). In  , we show the comparison between our BNA models, the firing rate brain network models, and the measured signal for cluster centers as a result of the k-means algorithm. We quantified how close the centers are to each other by taking the maximum correlation of each center to those measured in rs-fMRI. We calculated the length of time in each state (top left), the transition likelihood between states (bottom middle), and how many unique states were observed in a single scan (bottom left). The centers of the BNA models (middle two) compared with the traditional BNM (rightmost) are much more distinct from each other. The Firing Rate BNA model has the highest correlation with the rs-fMRI states (0.8 on average) and a similar number of states seen during a single scan. However, the Firing Rate BNA has a shorter dwell time and seems to move between states faster than observed in the measured signal. The Wilson-Cowan model has more variable and diverse centers and tends to have fewer of them in a single scan, but tends to dwell in them around as long as the measured data. The traditional firing rate brain network model is the least accurate, has few transitions between states, and dwells in a single state for a very long time. \n  \nK-means comparison. This figure compares the k-means centers and the transitions for the simulated (BNA and naive BNM) and the empirical signal (30 scans of 15 min). The seven centers are shown in the far right for each category (FR: firing rate, WC: Wilson-Cowan). A boxplot measuring the max correlation is shown (middle top) between each of the simulated centers to the centers from the rs-fMRI data. The dwell time in seconds in each of these centers is shown in the top left. The rest of the transition probabilities (diagonal zeroed out) are shown in the bottom middle. The number of centers in each of the 30 scans is also variable even though they all are defined to have seven clusters across all scans (bottom left). \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this manuscript, we adapted the brain network model with the recurrent neural networks in order to make short-time future predictions from observed rs-fMRI. Using this approach, we showed that using the previous measured rs-fMRI data point and an RNN in conjunction with a network-based model, we can predict large amounts of variance in the subsequent time step. We then showed that this system generalizes and can generate trajectories that are similar to resting-state trajectories over larger timescales. \n\n### Predicting Moment-to-Moment Variations \n  \nWe showed that a network-based model can account for up to 95% of the variance in the fMRI signal between two adjacent time points. This reproduction is not unique, however, and can be estimated using any number of latent variables. Although more complex architectures such as variational autoencoder might be able to successfully predict future rs-fMRI data (Pandarinath et al.,  ), the BNM provides an adequate rough guess of the system dynamics for the autoencoder to converge. This information helps the model to converge during training and make accurate predictions. Moreover, unlike a traditional machine learning approach, this approach yields testable latent variables that can be further evaluated using multimodal datasets, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings that have been used to generate excitatory and inhibitory currents synchronized with concurrent rs-fMRI recordings (Ritter, Schirner, McIntosh, & Jirsa,  ). \n\nFluctuations in spontaneous whole-brain activity have been shown to be nonrandom and highly structured (Zalesky et al.,  ). This suggests that rs-fMRI has both deterministic and stochastic components. The variance explained by the BNA at one time prediction represents a lower bound of the amount of determinism that exists in the signal. It is not surprising that this is the major component of rs-fMRI since the signal has been shown to be highly autocorrelated with itself (Arbabshirani et al.,  ). The simplified first-order autoregressive model, which assumes a steady baseline at the last measured time step, has similar results in performance to the BNA when compared with a single time step and has an   R   of 0.97. However, for multiple time steps into the future the autoregressive model performs poorly, compared with the BNA models. The two different BNA models perform at short-term scales about as well as each other. This suggests that the trajectory in the short time span is predictable to a certain degree regardless of the approach, but thereafter it starts diverging from the empirical measurements. The divergence from the original trajectory could be due to a number of sources, such as unknown task or stimulus information, noise, not incorporating higher order terms in the BNM, the fallacy of assuming that each ROI behaves in a homogenous fashion, or simply a mismatch between the algorithm and the data that increases over time. Note the BNA itself is not a deterministic system. The latent space variables are modeled as distributions before they are sampled, resulting in a stochastic system. \n\n\n### Evaluation on Long-Term Dynamics \n  \nAlthough both rs-fMRI and the BNA models are stochastic, long-term simulations of the network-based model are able to reproduce trajectories that are similar to those seen in rs-fMRI. Individual trajectories are varied but they repeat over time, suggesting that rs-fMRI follows a bounded stable   that the model is able to estimate. Therefore, random walks across this manifold have shared properties in both the model and the empirical signal. Our results also suggest that most of the resting-state manifold is strongly related to the network-based activity rather than input or random perturbations from noise sources such as higher neural processing. \n\nThe strongest metric demonstrating this relationship is average FC, which has a large correlation to the empirical dynamics (0.9 > correlation > 0.8). This is unsurprising since the traditional BNMs do almost as well as the BNAs in this metric, and correlations as high as 0.7 have been reported in the literature (Senden et al.,  ). Average FC seems to be more related to the structural input than the description of the dynamical system (Cabral et al.,  ; Kashyap & Keilholz,  ). However, the BNA does better than most BNMs in estimating interhemispheric FC correctly, which is usually challenging in network-based models because there are far fewer interhemispheric than intrahemispheric connections detected with diffusion MRI. The power spectrum profile is also mostly reproducible by the model, except in the very high frequency where the model has a lot more power than the empirical signal. This might occur because of the lack of friction in our model, namely that the signals are constantly propagated through feedback loops in the network without loss of energy, unlike the real system. Since most of predictability of the resting state comes from the structured low-frequency activity, we can filter synthesized signal without losing too much information. Other traditional brain network models using the virtual brain have also reported similar performance on power spectrum profiles (Ritter et al.,  ). \n\nAlthough most traditional BNMs have been able to reproduce to some degree the long-term-averaged properties such as average FC and power spectrum, they have had a harder time in reproducing faster scale dynamics such as reoccurring unique trajectories or the multistate transitions seen in dynamic FC (Cabral et al.,  ; Hansen, Battaglia, Spiegler, Deco, & Jirsa,  ; Kashyap & Keilholz,  ). The results from the QPP analysis, which extracts limit cycles, show that the simulated signal has a similar 20-s trajectory and that pattern is repeated over the course of minutes. The results from the k-means analysis on time-varying FC matrices show that the simulated signal has similar state transition in terms of both number and the spatial patterns to those seen in empirical rs-fMRI. This suggests that both of these properties arise naturally in the correct nonlinear network-based representation of rs-fMRI that can be inferred from the data using machine learning techniques. The firing rate BNA seems to fit the data better than the Wilson-Cowan BNA. This might be because the Wilson-Cowan BNA has additional nonlinearities due to the interaction between the excitatory and inhibitory currents. \n\nA direct comparison between our model and other brain network models in the literature on complex dynamical metrics is difficult because most brain network models use their own unique metric to compare against rs-fMRI and there is no established standard. The origin of these complex dynamics has been explained in different theoretical ways. These complex transitions can arise because of the particular nonlinearities of the system (Hansen et al.,  ), which can result in multiple attractors and limit cycles naturally. They can result from parameter changes to the network strength or Hopf bifurcations that cause the system to change its dynamics over time (Deco et al.,  ; Senden et al.,  ). They can also be the result of adding external input and stimuli into the system, causing a change from the zero-input manifold and altering the dynamics (Ashourvan et al.,  ; Deco et al.,  ). These are not mutually exclusive and could induce the changes at once. Our implementation is closest to the first interpretation of rs-fMRI. We explain the observed nonlinear properties of the data purely based on network propagation without the need for external input or a change of a bifurcation variable. \n\n\n### Errors Across Different ROIs \n  \nUsing our approach, it is not possible to tease apart the origin of the error that could arise because of a mismatch between the model and the empirical data or because of intrinsic noise. However, looking at the error across regions shows that the error is not evenly distributed across all regions of interest, which can give some clues to where it might arise. The error in reproducing the dynamics at one time step is highest in the nodes of the limbic system ( , bottom). We believe that our model performs less accurately in this system because they are highly connected to the amygdala and the hippocampus, which are not simulated in the model, and are the least connected nodes to the rest of the network (Cabral et al.,  ). Moreover, tractography has also been known to underestimate the uncinate fasciculus, the major highway between the temporal lobe and the frontal areas, which forms the backbone of the limbic system. The fiber has a very sharp angle that is hard to follow using tractography (Thomas et al.,  ). The echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence used to obtain rs-fMRI data has also known susceptibility issues at interfaces, which would affect the nodes at the proximity such as the frontal pole and the temporal pole, both of which have larger mean squared error compared with the other nodes. \n\n\n### Comparison With other Machine Learning and Time Forecasting Models \n  \nSimilar time forecasting has been attempted or is being attempted by several different labs at the time of this manuscript. A variant utilizes a variational autoencoder to find a latent space of brain trajectories that would fit the current data (Brown, Pasquini, Lee, & Seeley,  ). Another RNN-ICA version uses independento component analysis vectors as the latent space, while another method uses hidden Markov model to model the hidden states (Hjelm et al.,  ; Vidaurre et al.,  ). However, our method is unique in using brain network models as a latent space, whose variables are more interpretable since they represent the state of each neural population’s activity and can be tested using multimodal data. Moreover, none of the other architectures use their model for time series foresting or dynamical analysis, hence their results are not directly comparable to our work, although their methods are similar. \n\n\n\n## LIMITATIONS \n  \nThere are many assumptions that limit the scope of our approach. Machine learning, although good at learning structures in datasets, has a shortcoming of arbitrarily creating a system to fit the data, and every instantiation of the system produces slightly different properties of the simulated system. We tried to address this issue by using various techniques such as using structural constraints, dropout of   (LSTM) units, using probability to track the latent variables, and taking the results of multiple runs, in order to make the system more reliable and reproducible. Another limitation of this model is that it needs 50 time points prior to the data point in order to solve for the initial conditions. Shorter time intervals than 50 time points are faster to train, but are less accurate in estimating slow processes. The longer segments required a larger LSTM network and longer training times and were less accurate in our dataset. There are more complex architectures that could solve for the initial conditions faster, such as a forward-backward LSTM architecture (Pandarinath et al.,  ). On the network side, the parcellation scheme reduces the complexity of the signal and discretizes the network. Improvements can be made by allowing for continuous propagation along the cortical sheet, as in the neural field models. Tractography also has its limitations, and better estimates of structural networks should make the model more realistic and improve results especially in regions that are not very strongly connected to the rest of the network. Simulating more of the central nervous system including subcortical regions would also lead to a more biologically plausible model. \n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nWe set out to investigate the extent to which network-based theory can explain the moment-to-moment variations seen in rs-fMRI signal’s. Using a novel machine learning approach, we solve for the initial state of traditional network-based models and show that we can account for most of the variation seen in the signal and predict accurately (> 0.6 R ) for at least five consecutive time points. Longer instantiations of the system show that our model is able to produce complex trajectories of the nonlinear dynamical system on the order of minutes. We believe that our BNA will be useful when a generative model of rest is needed. Moreover, it can be trained to predict in real time, which allows contrast against dynamics that contain deviations from rest such as in task fMRI studies. In the future, it can also be used to investigate deviations from the manifold such as in task input or due to noisy sources. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Mathematical Background \n  \nThe brain network autoencoder is constructed using the constraints from the brain network model, in conjunction with a recurrent neural network variant known as long short-term memory. The overall design is shown in   and implemented using Python TensorFlow. The architecture is a sequential autoencoder, as it is trained with the previous time point to predict the next consecutive time point and uses a latent space where the dynamics are constrained to a smaller space defined by BNM equations to reconstruct the next time point. \n  \nSchematic of the autoencoder. The measurement   x  (  n  ) is passed into the LSTM in order to estimate  (  n  ), which lies in the data manifold. Using the BNM forward equations and  (  n  ) as our initial conditions, we estimate  (  n   + 1). The system is trained by difference in our predicted versus actual measurement at   x  (  n   + 1). \n  \nFormally, in order to predict the next time point, for each neural measured time point   x  (  n  ) we map it to the space   F  (  x  (  n  )).   F   is the transformation performed by the RNN and lives in   R  , where   M   represents the   M   distinct ROIs being modeled and   T   is the length of previous time points that the LSTM depends on. The next time point is computed as   x  (  n   + 1) =   BNM  (  F  (  x  (  n  ))). In essence, the LSTM does a nonlinear coordinate transform of the vector   x  (  n  ) into the brain network space where the dynamics are well defined and we can predict the next time point. This process is shown pictorially in  , where we show the projection of each data point shown in filled blue circle’s into the manifold represented by the BNM shown in hollow blue circle’s. On the manifold, we can use the BNM equations to update it to the next time step shown in orange.   shows the actual architecture used to update the time steps. \n\nFor the simplest implementation of BNM, the firing rate model, we can assume the function to be linear with the observation such that   BNM  (  x  ) becomes   A   ×   x  , where the matrix   A   is the graph Laplacian and   A   =   k   ×   SN   −   I  , where   k   < 1 and   SN   is the structural matrix as measured through tractography using diffusion tensor imaging (see   section,  ,  ; Hagmann et al.,  ). We use graph Laplacian because it represent’s a well-studied dynamical system known as the consensus equation. On its own, the consensus system does not add in any unstable dynamics because all of its eigenvalues are less than 0, if   k   is set to less than 1 (Mesbahi & Egerstedt,  ). Therefore the network propagation dies out over subsequent time steps. The eigenvectors of   A   have also shown similarities to rs-fMRI networks (Atasoy, Donnelly, & Pearson,  ). This algorithm assumes that the Jacobian matrix representing the changes of one brain region with respect to another more or less lies in the direction of the structural fiber network and the nonlinear discrepancies are dealt with by the LSTM (Honey et al.,  ). This can be seen in the Results section ( ), where latent space of the firing rate model is almost identical to the measured data, suggesting that the transformation is near an identity transformation. In a more complex BNM, such as the Wilson-Cowan, the excitatory current is strongly correlated with the signal although less than in the firing rate model, as the model has its own inbuilt nonlinearities and deviates further from the graph Laplacian. \n\n\n### Implementation \n  \nThe preprocessed data (see   section,  ,  ) is first cut into contiguous segments of length   k  . This whole segment is then passed into the long short term memory unit as shown in  . The units are built using the TensorFlow Python module, specifically the graphics processing unit boosted version to improve speed and performance. The LSTM units take in a series of consecutive time points, and output a sequence of the same length of time points. The LSTM units are a form of recurrent neural networks and have memory of previous time points by using a hidden state vector that it uses as an input to itself for the next consecutive time point. Hence, LSTMs have become popular in the machine learning community because of their success in using this architecture in modeling time series such as speech and natural language processing, in self-driving cars, and even in neural Turing computers thought to emulate biological intelligence (Graves, Mohamed, & Hinton,  ; Graves & Schmidhuber,  ; Graves, Wayne, & Danihelka,  ). Moreover, they solve the problem of learning structure across infinite sequences of consecutive time points by using a forget gate to truncate inputs seen from a long time ago. In practice this means that they need to be trained with a finite sequence length of data. \n\nFor our implementation we tested data of length 25, 50, and 100 time points (18, 36, 72 s), as seen in  , left. The model performed best on 50-length segments, and slightly worse for shorter and longer segments. The LSTM network was also stacked into several layers in a similar manner that convolutional neural networks are stacked together in a series. We used seven identical layers to model the fMRI time series. In general, more layers improve accuracy as long as there is enough data in the training set to scale the size of the network; otherwise, there is a risk on overfitting. Using the inference error as a metric, we also swept the number of training iterations until the performance on unseen cross-validated testing data was about the same as the training data as shown in  , right. For the cross-validation we split the data of 447 individual scans for 40 test and 407 training samples randomly. At the right amount of training steps, the system does relatively equally in test and training sets. An overtrained or undertrained network, on the other hand, resulted in large differences in test and training, although all three models do equally well on the training dataset. In order to additionally control for overfitting, we also used the inbuilt TensorFlow dropout function that prunes a large number of the weaker weights used in the LSTMs. This has been shown in neural networks to better generalize to unseen test data (Srivastava, Hinton, Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Salakhutdinov,  ). \n  \nTuning parameters. Left: The effect of over- and undertraining the network. The performance on the test data compared with the training data at 500 and 5,000 is much worse. For our network size it performed best at around 2,000 iterations. It is compared with the autoregressive model as baseline. Right: The effect of picking different length segments and the performance accuracy. Again the maximum is closer to the middle, which was in our case 50. Too small and too large networks are slightly worse at learning the relationship between past and future rs-fMRI time points. \n  \nTo speed up the training process, we utilized minibatches, where multiple instances of the training data are used simultaneously to train the network (Ioffe & Szegedy,  ). The number of instances that the network can be trained on simultaneously depends on the size of the training data, and with 400 subjects we used 20 instances to simultaneously train the algorithm. The LSTM network in our model is initialized to a random point, and the first time segment supplies the initial state for the next segment. The performance on the very first block is very poor because of the unknown hidden state and is not included in our evaluation of the algorithm in the Results section. This is a limitation with our implementation, and more complex architectures that solve for the initial state might circumvent this problem. \n\nFor our BNM, we choose the firing rate model and the Wilson-Cowan model described in more detail in  . Our choice of brain network models reflects the constraints of this approach. Unlike the traditional brain network model where the simulation time step can be arbitrary, we are constrained by the one-time-step prediction approach of synchronizing with the measured data. Therefore, models that utilize high-frequency oscillators such as the Hopf or the Kuramoto model and are usually simulated at a higher time resolution are more awkward to adapt into the fMRI framework, but would be more useful for training on faster datasets such as MEG or electroencephalogram (EEG). The two different models were also chosen in order to characterize the approach in terms of a simpler linear firing rate model and the more complex multistate nonlinear Wilson-Cowan model. To account for noise in the brain network model, we chose to define the output of the LSTM as a distribution with a mean and standard deviation. We then sample from this distribution in order to generate the initial state. By representing the mapping as a nondeterministic process, the algorithm generalizes to perform better on test datasets and gives more robust results between instantiations. \n \n#### Box 1. Brain network models \n  \nThe brain network model is constructed by specifying a parcellation or atlas, and each region of interest becomes the node and the edges represent the number of fibers between regions and is calculated using tractography. A brain network model in its most general form (see  ) describes the change in neural activity   x   in region of interest   i   as a function of a sum of its neighbors’   j   activity and its own activity and the physical properties of neural communication between   i   and   j   represented by the vector   ρ   (i.e., the number of fibers between regions, the delay in propagation). The network dynamics are also mediated by a k-dimensional vector   u   representing all subcortical and sensory inputs, and the vector   π   representing again the physical properties that project these inputs into the brain (i.e., thalamic tracts into cortex). For resting-state activity, the assumption is that   u  (  t  ) = 0 ∀   t   and the first term dominates the activity. The function   F   for example, can be as simple as the firing rate model where   w   represents the number of fibers between   i   and   j  , and   k   represents the global coupling parameter. In a more complex model the state variable   x   can also be represented by multiple variables such as the Wilson-Cowan model shown in the equation below, which uses excitatory and inhibitory currents to describe the change in activity at every region of interest. In the firing rate model the output is taken to be the firing rate, and in the Wilson-Cowan model the fMRI signal is assumed to be just the excitatory signal since it dominates metabolically. These models are thus used to generate whole-brain signals by choosing a random initial point and updating the next step via integration and generating the time series. \n  \nBrain network model. The brain network model state space is constructed by averaging the time courses of each parcellated region. The change of one of those areas   x   is a function of its own activity and its neighbors’ activity that it is connected with   ρ  , and the projection of external cortical input   u   to the brain via   π  . \n  \n \nThe output of the BNM is taken to be the next fMRI predicted time step. The loss function then is taken as the difference between the predicted and the empirical next time points, and the autoencoder is trained based on this gradient. By forcing the output of the BNM to be the next predicted fMRI signal, the output of the LSTM is forced to become the closest initial time point and the LSTM solves for the nonlinear transformation. We used the TensorFlow Adam Optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 to solve for the autoencoder. \n\n\n### Experimental Data \n  \n#### Structural network. \n  \nTo estimate the structural network we ran tractography on five HCP diffusion-weighted images using the freely available software MRtrix (Kashyap & Keilholz,  ; Van Essen et al.,  ). From the tractography we estimated the number of fibers that intersected two ROIs in the Desikan-Killiany atlas and normalized the power by dividing by the surface area of the receiving region (Cabral et al.,  ; Desikan et al.,  ). The matrix is finally normalized by dividing by the largest eigenvalue in order for the graph Laplacian (  kSN   −   I  ) to have eigenvalues that are all negative (Cabral et al.,  ). This normalizes the dynamics so that the feedback decays over time, and does not exponentially increase the signal over time. The value of   k   is a hyperparameter, but simulations over a few different values around 0.9 showed that it made little difference, because the LSTM would just adjust its output correspondingly. The algorithm is robust as long as it is biased around values that would allow it to converge. For the Wilson-Cowan we set both the   k   values to 0.9 as well, and learned the other parameters. We could also learn the value   k  , but since it is not unique the reproduced latent state ends up further away from the signal. Since the autoencoder will fit the data either way, it is important to determine the constraints from the onset and constrain the latent state to be closer to the measurements. \n\n\n#### fMRI data. \n  \nWe trained our algorithm using both resting-state and task data scans. On evaluation, we have only shown our results on testing resting-state data and not task data. This was done because the algorithm was able to able to perform better on our short- and long-term metrics when trained with more varied data such as task. Since the focus of this paper is only on resting state, we have only shown our results on evaluating resting-state metrics on held out resting-state data, but we are planning to address task data in a future publication. \n\nWe acquired our data from the 447 minimally processed surface files from the Human Connectome Project (Van Essen et al.,  ). We took the MSMAII scans that were registered to standard space and in CIFTI format and ICA-denoised them utilizing the 300 MELODIC ICA vectors that are provided from HCP. We transform from the surface-voxel time series to the ROI time series by averaging all voxels according to the parcellations established by the Desikan-Killiany atlas. This was done on an individual level since the surface parcellations are provided by HCP and FreeSurfer for each individual subject (aparc and aprac2009 files). The signal is then bandpass filtered from 0.0008 Hz to 0.125 Hz and then global signal regressed using a general linear model with the mean time course of all cortical parcellations. The final signal is subsequently normalized along both axes (Kashyap & Keilholz,  ). For the task data, each dataset was processed separately (language, working memory, motor, social, emotional, gambling, relational) and then concatenated together. Each task dataset was rounded to the closest multiple of 50 and the autoencoder fed alternating segments of task and rest data. This signal is then fed as both the input and the output to the autoencoder and is the signal that we refer to as the empirical rs-fMRI for the rest of the paper (Kashyap & Keilholz,  ). \n\n\n\n### Dynamical Analysis Techniques \n  \nThe BNA timeseries were first filtered (0.008–0.125 Hz) before analyzing the properties using dynamical analysis techniques. The dynamical analysis techniques such as QPP and the k-means analysis are described in detail in our previous publication, which outlines metrics in order to compare the simulated whole-brain signal and the rs-fMRI signals (Kashyap & Keilholz,  ). The QPP algorithm randomly picks a 20-s segment of data and correlates it with the whole signal. At the regions of peak correlation, the algorithm sums up all segments and creates a new template and iteratively converges to a repeating pattern (Majeed et al.,  ). The k-means analysis takes in sliding-windowed (36-s) functional connectivity matrices that are Fisher transformed and clusters them into seven different clusters (Allen et al.,  ). We used an L1 distance to calculate the distance between matrices (Allen et al.,  ). The resulting transitions between clusters was then quantified. \n\n\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n  \nWe would like to thank Dr. Chethan Pandarinath, who provided invaluable help and insight into development and interpretation of our initial brain network autoencoder.

The risk of suicide in BD is among the highest of all psychiatric conditions. Self-harm, including suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury, is a leading risk factor for suicide. Neuroimaging studies suggest reward circuits are implicated in both BD and self-harm; however, studies have yet to examine self-harm related resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) phenotypes within adolescent BD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nResting-state fMRI data were analyzed for 141 adolescents, ages 13–20 years, including 38 with BD and lifetime self-harm (BD ), 33 with BD and no self-harm (BD ), and 70 healthy controls (HC). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala were examined as regions of interest in seed-to-voxel analyses. A general linear model was used to explore the bivariate correlations for each seed. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nBD  had increased positive rsFC between the left amygdala and left lateral occipital cortex, and between the right dlPFC and right frontal pole, and increased negative rsFC between the left amygdala and left superior frontal gyrus compared to BD  and HC. BD  had increased positive rsFC of the right OFC with the precuneus and left paracingulate gyrus compared to BD  and HC. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis study provides preliminary evidence of altered reward-related rsFC in relation to self-harm in adolescents with BD. Between-group differences conveyed a combination of putative risk and resilience connectivity patterns. Future studies are warranted to evaluate changes in rsFC in response to treatment and related changes in self-harm. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSuicide is the second leading cause of death amongst youth ages 10–24 years (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention & National Center for Injury Prevention and Control,  ). Self-harm, defined as self-damaging acts both with and without suicidal intent, is the strongest predictor of future suicide attempts (Mars et al.,  ; Muehlenkamp, Claes, Havertape, & Plener,  ). Bipolar disorder (BD), which affects approximately 2% of the population, is a major risk factor for suicide and is present in up to 14% of all suicide deaths, with suicide rates up to 20 times higher than the general population (Latalova, Kamaradova, & Prasko,  ; Schaffer et al.,  ; Tondo, Isacsson, & Baldessarini,  ). However, little is known regarding the biological factors underlying the increased risk of suicide in BD (Huber & Yurgelun-Todd,  ). \n\nNeuroimaging studies examining self-harm across psychiatric disorders implicate reward circuit dysfunction, including the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and striatum (Haber & Knutson,  ). Hypersensitivity to reward-relevant stimuli is a key component of the emotion dysregulation that characterizes BD (Henry et al.,  ). Studies of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in youth with BD have implicated anomalous fronto-limbic connectivity (Dickstein et al.,  ; Gao et al.,  ; Kennerley & Walton,  ; Ridderinkhof, van den Wildenberg, Segalowitz, & Carter,  ; Singh, Kelley, Chang, & Gotlib,  ; Stoddard et al.,  ; Tang et al.,  ; Xiao et al.,  ). Task-based functional connectivity studies found youth with a history of self-harm have altered connectivity in reward-related regions including the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) among others (Auerbach, Pagliaccio, Allison, Alqueza, & Alonso,  ). Studies examining neurostructure among youth with a history of suicidal ideation and self-harm have found reduced cortical measures in various reward-related regions including the OFC and striatum (Auerbach et al.,  ; Gifuni et al.,  ; Ho et al.,  ,  ). \n\nStudies examining rsFC among youth with major depressive disorder (MDD) found greater severity of suicidal ideation associated with decreased connectivity between central executive, salience and default mode networks, and decreases in suicidal ideation longitudinally associated with increased connectivity in the salience network (Auerbach et al.,  ). Moreover, among adults with mood disorders, there are differences in rsFC patterns in the default mode, limbic, salience, and central executive networks among those with a history of suicide attempts versus those with only suicidal ideation (Caceda, Bush, James, Stowe, & Kilts,  ). Studies of adults with BD and MDD have found anomalous functional connectivity in relation to self-harm (Bani-Fatemi et al.,  ; Cheng et al.,  ; Schmaal et al.,  ). \n\nTaken together, reward circuit dysfunction is implicated in both BD and self-harm, self-harm is highly prevalent in BD, and both BD and self-harm each confer an increased risk of suicide in youth, there is a gap of knowledge to date regarding rsFC in relation to self-harm among youth with BD. We therefore examined rsFC in youth with BD, comparing those with a history of self-harm (BD adolescents with a history of self-harm, BD ) to those without a history of self-harm (BD adolescents without a history of self-harm, BD ) and HC, in four regions-of-interest (ROIs) within the reward network. We chose to examine the dlPFC, OFC, and amygdala as they have been repeatedly associated with both BD and self-harm (Auerbach et al.,  ; Latalova et al.,  ; Singh et al.,  ). While we hypothesized between-group differences in these prespecified reward-related regions, we did not have   a priori   predictions regarding the direction of these associations. Progress in the understanding of rsFC phenotypes associated with self-harm has the potential to identify treatment targets, and facilitate treatment selection and monitoring, toward the goal of reducing suicidality in BD (Huber & Yurgelun-Todd,  ). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAdolescents, ages 13–20, with BD were recruited primarily from a tertiary clinical-research program focused on youth BD. HC adolescents were recruited primarily from the community via advertisements. HC participants had no history of major mood diagnoses, recent anxiety disorders, or any first- or second-degree relatives with BD or psychotic disorder. The presence of any MRI contraindications or recent substance dependence was an exclusion criterion in both groups. \n\nAll participants and their parent(s) provided informed consent. This study was approved by the local research ethics board. The authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. Study participants and their parent(s) were interviewed by a trained interviewer using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders–Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL) (Kaufman et al.,  ), a semi-structured diagnostic interview, to collect demographic and clinical information which was performed on the same day as neuroimaging. \n\nHistory of lifetime self-harm, including a suicide attempt and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), was assessed using the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE) (Keller et al.,  ) Self-Injurious/Suicidal Behavior Scale interview. A suicide attempt was operationally defined as any self-injurious act with a level of the stated intent of at least 3 (‘Definite but still ambivalent’) and a level of medical threat of at least 3 (‘Mild’) on the K-SADS-PL Depression Rating Scale (DRS) (Chambers et al.,  ). Online Supplementary Table S1 includes descriptive anchors for intent and medical threat for the LIFE Self-Injurious/Suicidal Behavior Scale. NSSI was defined as any self-damaging act which did not reach the thresholds for intent and/or medical threat of a suicide attempt. However, if the self-injurious behavior was characteristic of, and better accounted for by, another psychiatric diagnosis (e.g. purging as part of an eating disorder, skin picking, hair pulling), then it was not included. Self-harm was defined as having a history of any self-injurious behavior with or without the intent to end their life. Therefore, participants with a suicide attempt and/or NSSI were categorized as BD , and those with no such history were categorized as BD . \n\nParticipants and their parent(s) were also interviewed for current and most severe lifetime mood episodes using the Mania Rating Scale (MRS) (Axelson et al.,  ) and DRS (Chambers et al.,  ). Diagnoses were based on DSM-IV criteria as this sample was recruited from 2012 through 2017 and the DSM-5 version of K-SADS-PL was not available until December 2016. BD participants met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for BD-I, BD-II or BD-not otherwise specified (NOS), operationalized as per the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth (COBY) study (Axelson et al.,  ). All psychiatric diagnoses were confirmed by a licensed child-adolescent psychiatrist. Anxiety disorders included generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and anxiety disorder NOS. Eating disorders included anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder NOS. The Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) was used to obtain overall function in relation to psychiatric symptoms for current (past month), highest past year, and lifetime most severe episode (Shaffer et al.,  ). CGAS scores were rated from 0–100, with higher scores reflecting better functioning. Information regarding lifetime physical and sexual abuse history was obtained from the post-traumatic stress disorder screener within the K-SADS-PL (Kaufman et al.,  ) and from a medical history parent-report containing items querying physical and sexual abuse. Legal history includes any police contact or arrests. The Family History Screen interview was completed for all first- and second-degree relatives to ascertain family psychiatric history (Weissman et al.,  ). Pubertal status was determined using the Pubertal Developmental Scale self-report and reported as Tanner stage (1–5) (Petersen, Crockett, Richards, & Boxer,  ). \n\n\n### Magnetic resonance imaging acquisition \n  \nImages were acquired on a 3 Tesla Philips Achieva scanner. Structural images were acquired using T1-weighted high-resolution fast-echo imaging (repetition time/echo time/inversion time = 9.5/2.3/1400 ms; spatial resolution 0.94 × 1.17 × 1.2 mm, 256 × 164 × 140 matrix, scan duration 8 m 56 s). Resting-state fMRI was acquired using T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging (TR/TE = 1500/30 ms, flip angle = 70°, ascending slices, a field of view = 230 × 181 mm, spatial resolution = 3 × 3 × 4 mm, matrix 76 × 60 × 28, volumes = 230, scan duration 5 m 50 s). Participants were instructed to rest with their eyes open while staring at a fixation cross and not to focus on any particular thoughts. \n\n\n### fMRI preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing and analyses were completed using the CONN toolbox ( ) (Van Dijk et al.,  ; Whitfield-Gabrieli & Nieto-Castanon,  ). The first three volumes of functional data were removed in order to account for signal equilibration. The default pipeline for volume-based analyses in the CONN toolbox (Whitfield-Gabrieli & Nieto-Castanon,  ) was performed for data preprocessing of functional volumes which included the functional realignment and unwarping (participant motion estimation and correction), functional and structural translation, slice-timing correction, functional outlier detection (ART-based identification of outlier scans for scrubbing), functional and structural direct segmentation and normalization to MNI space (simultaneous gray/white/CSF segmentation), and functional smoothing [8 mm FWHM Gaussian filter, using SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK;  )]. Head motion was accounted for within the CONN toolbox by identifying problematic timepoints using the Artifact Detection Tools (ART,  ) and via manual inspection of maximum motion at each volume. In ART, we selected the ‘conservative’ setting which defines outlier images as displacement of >0.5 mm from the previous frame in   x  ,   y  , or   z   direction, alternatively if the global mean intensity in the image was >3 standard deviation thresholds from mean image intensity for the entire resting scan. In addition, all volumes were manually examined for motion outliers (>2 mm or 2-degree rotation in any direction:   x  ,   y  ,   z  ) and participants were excluded if they had any volumes with motion outliers. A total of 179 adolescents participated in the study, of which 38 were removed due to head motion during the scan (18 BD, 6 BD  and 12 BD ; 20 HC). CONN's default denoising pipeline was used which uses a linear regression of potential confounds including: white matter, CSF, re-alignment, identified outlier scans or scrubbing, and effect of rest (i.e. removing the trend/ramp that is evident at the initiation of the scan session, convolved with hemodynamic response function). Band pass filtering was performed for all functional data (0.008–0.09 Hz). An examination of the histograms from the functional connectivity values for each participant was performed by two independent raters after denoising and revealed normally distributed data for all participants not previously excluded due to motion. \n\nThe dlPFC was explored using two seeds, Brodmann area (BA) 9 and BA 46 defined from the BA atlas. The amygdala and OFC seeds were identified using the Harvard-Oxford atlas, generated by the CONN toolbox. The following additional three seed regions defined by the Harvard-Oxford atlas were evaluated in exploratory post-hoc between-group analyses: nucleus accumbens, caudate and putamen. All seeds were parcellated into right and left within the atlases. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nDemographics characteristics were compared between the three groups using SPSS Version 26. Group comparisons were made using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) univariate model for continuous variables, and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Clinical characteristics were compared between the BD  and BD  using   t   tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables. Statistical significance was set at   p   < 0.05. \n\nA seed-to-voxel approach was employed for functional connectivity analyses; Fischer-transformed bivariate correlation coefficients were computed between the timeseries for each bilateral ROI seed and each individual voxel BOLD timeseries to create whole-brain functional connectivity maps. Beta values reported in   represent Fischer-transformed correlation coefficient values. A general linear model was used to examine the differences between HC versus BD  versus BD . Second-level analyses of functional connectivity were conducted using multiple regression analyses (voxel-wise   F   statistics) to examine the seed-to-voxel connectivity differences between BD  BD  and HC. Age and sex were demeaned and included as covariates in the analyses comparing three groups. Analyses used a voxel size of 3 mm isotropic. Primary analyses used cluster thresholding set at   p   < 0.05 false-discovery rate-corrected, and a more conservative cluster threshold of   p   < 0.01 was used in secondary analyses. Voxel statistical height threshold was set to   p   < 0.001 to identify differences in connectivity between the three groups. For all imaging analyses, Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to determine significance   p   < 0.01. Significant clusters from the second-level GLM analyses were exported as masks to conduct post-hoc pair-wise comparisons in ROI-to-ROI analyses. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was made (  p   < 0.01) for pairwise post-hoc tests. Four sensitivity analyses were conducted within BD  and BD  groups to examine the impact of (1) current depression symptoms (2) current mania symptoms (3) current use of lithium [due to putative anti-suicidal properties (Lewitzka et al.,  )] and (4) current use of second-generation antipsychotics [SGA; due to effects on reward processing via anti-dopaminergic mechanisms (Fervaha et al.,  )] while controlling for age and sex in ANCOVA models. Medication use was coded in a binary manner (‘0’ for no current use of medication, ‘1’ for current use of medication) and current MRS and DRS scores were mean-centered and used as continuous variables. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed examining pubertal status (Tanner stage) between BD , BD , and HC groups. An ANCOVA model examining rsFC between BD and HC, controlling for age and sex, was also performed for descriptive purposes.\n   \nVoxels showing significant connectivity with the left amygdala seed.

The total number of volumes excluded due to motion outliers did not significantly differ by group [mean: BD  = 22.52 BD  = 25.88, HC = 22.53; F(2, 140) = 0.17,   p   = 0.84]. The average framewise displacement across valid scans also did not differ by group [mean: BD  = 0.22 BD  = 0.22, HC = 0.20; F(2, 140) = 0.56,   p   = 0.57]. Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in  . There were more females in the BD  compared to BD  and HC groups. Tanner stage was higher in BD  relative to BD  and HC adolescents. BD  adolescents had higher BMI and greater proportion of Caucasian race compared to HC. In terms of Children's Global Assessment Score, for current functioning, HC had higher functioning than both BD  and BD ; and for highest functioning score in the past year HC had the highest functioning, followed by BD , followed by BD . There were no HC participants with a history of self-harm. BD  had a higher rate of psychosis and family history of BD compared to BD . BD  had higher current and the most severe past depression scores, higher current mania rating scores, lower CGAS scores for the highest level of functioning in the past year, and a greater proportion of lifetime suicidal ideation, lifetime eating disorders, and lifetime nicotine use compared to BD . In terms of medication use, BD  had a higher proportion of participants currently taking lithium compared to BD . There were no significant differences between the groups for lifetime medication use.\n   \nDemographic and clinical characteristics \n      \n\n### Seed-to-voxel analyses \n  \nThe HC versus BD  versus BD  analyses revealed altered rsFC between groups for the left amygdala seed, right OFC seed, and right dlPFC (BA 46) seed ( ). Specifically, there was a significant difference in rsFC between the left amygdala seed and a cluster within the left lateral occipital cortex (  p   = 0.002) as well as a cluster within the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG,   p   = 0.002;  ). Furthermore, between-group differences in rsFC were observed between the right OFC seed and two clusters, including the precuneus (  p   < 0.001) and the left paracingulate gyrus (  p   = 0.04) differed ( ). Last, there was a significant difference in rsFC between the right dlPFC seed (BA 46) and a cluster within the right frontal pole (  p   = 0.008;  ). All significant clusters except the left paracingulate gyrus survived cluster thresholding at   p   < 0.01. There were no significant differences in rsFC originating from the right amygdala, left OFC, left dlPFC (BA 46), or bilateral dlPFC (BA 9) seeds.\n   \nCharacteristics of significant rsFC clusters \n      \n\nResults for the descriptive BD versus HC analysis are presented in online Supplementary Table S2. \n\n\n### Post-hoc ROI-to-ROI analyses \n  \nSignificant clusters from seed-to-voxel analyses were exported as masks to conduct ROI-to-ROI post-hoc pairwise comparisons. BD  showed significantly higher anti-correlation between the left amygdala and left SFG compared to BD  and HC. Furthermore, BD  showed significantly increased connectivity between the left amygdala and left lateral occipital cortex compared to BD  and HC. There were no significant differences between BD  and HC for the amygdala seed ROI-to-ROI analyses. \n\nBD  showed significantly higher anti-correlation between the right OFC seed and the precuneus compared to BD  and HC. BD  showed significantly higher positive connectivity between the right OFC seed and the left paracingulate gyrus compared to BD  and HC. There were no significant differences between BD  and HC for the right OFC seed ROI-to-ROI analyses. \n\nBD  showed significantly higher anti-correlation between the right dlPFC (BA 46) seed and the right frontal pole compared to BD  and HC. There were no significant differences between BD  and HC in right dlPFC (BA 46) seed ROI-to-ROI analyses. \n\nClusters identified in the main analysis remained significant when controlling for the role of medications (SGA, lithium) and mood (current DRS score, current MRS score) within BD groups. In sensitivity analyses controlling for pubertal status within all three groups, all clusters from the main analyses remained significant. The average framewise displacement across scans had a significant small correlation with connectivity results between the left amygdala seed and left superior frontal gyrus cluster (  r   = 0.19,   p   = 0.03). There were no other significant correlations between average framewise displacement and connectivity patterns from the primary results. \n\n\n### Exploratory post-hoc analyses \n  \nThere was altered connectivity between the three groups from the left nucleus accumbens seed to the left superior parietal lobule (cluster size: 331; MNI coordinates   x  : −40,   y  : −52,   z  : 56;   p   = 0.00002; online Supplementary Fig. S1) which was significant at cluster thresholding of   p   < 0.01. There were no significant between-group differences in functional connectivity from the right nucleus accumbens, bilateral caudate, and bilateral putamen seeds. In post-hoc pairwise comparisons, HC showed significantly higher anti-correlation between the left nucleus accumbens and the left superior parietal lobule compared to BD  and BD . There were no significant differences between BD  and BD . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study employed a seed-to-voxel approach to investigate patterns of differential reward circuit rsFC among BD  BD  and HC adolescents. Results revealed between-group differences in rsFC among three seeds in the reward circuit: the left amygdala, right OFC, and right dlPFC (BA 46). First, we found increased connectivity between the left amygdala seed and the left lateral occipital cortex and decreased connectivity between the left amygdala seed and the left SFG in BD  relative to BD  and HC adolescents. Second, we observed increased connectivity from the right OFC seed to the precuneus and left paracingulate gyrus in BD  compared to BD . Third, we found increased connectivity between the right dlPFC (BA 46) and the right frontal pole in BD  relative to BD  and HC adolescents. This study represents the only study to investigate the rsFC of self-harm within youth BD. Two unique patterns of altered reward circuit connectivity among the BD groups emerged from our findings: connectivity from the OFC seed was different in BD  as compared to both BD  and HC adolescents, reflecting a putative neurofunctional indicator of risk; and connectivity from the amygdala seed and dlPFC seed (BA 46) was different in BD  as compared to both BD  and HC adolescents, reflecting a putative neurofunctional indicator of resilience. \n\nThe paucity of studies investigating rsFC associated with self-harm in BD provides a limited basis for contextualizing current findings. Two prior studies have examined the rsFC of self-harm using combined samples of adults with MDD and BD, neither of which has examined the reward circuit. One study found that individuals with a history of suicide attempts had higher connectivity between the habenula and right amygdala (in addition to other regions) compared to those without a history of suicide attempts and HCs (Ambrosi et al.,  ). The second study found connectivity patterns between the default mode network and the limbic, salience and central executive networks, differentiated participants with a recent suicide attempt from participants with suicidal ideation but no recent self-harm (Caceda et al.,  ). There has only been one study examining rsFC of self-harm within BD, showing differences in connectivity in the precuneus, insula, and superior temporal gyrus between those with and without a history of suicide attempts (Cheng et al.,  ). \n\nWe found increased positive connectivity between the right OFC seed and the precuneus among BD , implicated in our findings as a putative risk indicator. The precuneus is involved in a variety of highly complex tasks, including self-referential processing (Cavanna & Trimble,  ). A prior study showed that youth with MDD and a history of self-harm had greater rsFC between the precuneus and the SFG among other regions (Auerbach et al.,  ). The precuneus has been found to have decreased global brain connectivity in BD-I adults with a history of suicide attempts relative to no suicide attempt (Cheng et al.,  ). \n\nThere was increased connectivity from the left amygdala seed to the left lateral occipital cortex and decreased connectivity to the left SFG in BD  relative to BD  and HC adolescents. A similar pattern emerged between the right dlPFC (BA 46) seed and the right frontal pole. These findings were somewhat unexpected, given that we hypothesized that BD  would have altered connectivity relative to the other two groups. While we recognize the limitations of a cross-sectional study, we speculate that this finding might reflect a putative compensatory mechanism of the BD  group which may be protective against self-harm. A prior study similarly found depressed youth without a history of suicide attempts had different activation patterns from HC during an Iowa Gambling Task, whereas depressed youth with a prior suicide attempt did not differ from HC (Auerbach et al.,  ). Although significant brain regions in the prior study differed from those identified in the current study findings, there is a similar pattern suggestive of a protective rsFC phenotype for adolescents with a mood disorder without a history of self-harm. \n\nThe significant clusters identified in this study are located in brain regions involved in various neurocognitive functions relevant to BD. The SFG, a key region involved in working memory (du Boisgueheneuc et al.,  ), was found to have decreased connectivity to the left amygdala seed among BD , potentially representing an adaptive biological marker of resilience. Similar to our findings of negative connectivity among those without a history of self-harm, a prior study found that adult men with MDD and history of a suicide attempt had increased neural activity within the OFC and decreased activity in the SFG during exposure to angry faces compared to those without a prior suicide attempt (Jollant et al.,  ). The right frontal pole was found to have decreased connectivity to the right dlPFC (BA 46) seed among BD , a similar pattern to our left amygdala seed findings. A prior study found lower rsFC between the amygdala and right frontal pole among adolescents with NSSI compared to HC (Auerbach et al.,  ). Furthermore, increased frontal pole volume predicted suicide attempts in a sample of females with BD (Bani-Fatemi et al.,  ). Prior studies have contrasted our observed pattern of negative connectivity in adolescents without a history of self-harm. In a study of youth with BD, those   with   a history of suicide attempts had decreased connectivity between the amygdala and OFC during happy and neutral face conditions (Auerbach et al.,  ); the same pattern was observed in adults with MDD and a history of suicide attempts, who showed decreased activation in left OFC and left occipital cortex compared to both patient controls and HC (Jollant et al.,  ). \n\nIn exploratory analyses, we examined additional subcortical reward-related regions. We found that BD youth with and without a history of self-harm had decreased functional connectivity from the left nucleus accumbens seed to the left superior parietal lobule compared to HC youth. There was no difference between BD youth with and without a history of self-harm, limiting the interpretation that this finding may be related to self-harm. The nucleus accumbens is part of the ventral striatum, which is a key region in reward circuitry and implicated in self-harm (Schmaal et al.,  ). A study of female youth with a history of NSSI found that reduction of NSSI following treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was associated with decreased functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the superior medial frontal cortex (Cullen et al.,  ). While the current study did not focus on demographic and clinical differences between the BD  and BD  groups, some differences that emerged warrant comment. There was a higher proportion of females in the BD  group, as could be expected based on the clinical epidemiology of self-harm (Mars et al.,  ). While the BD  group was younger, pubertal stages were higher in this group, which may be attributable to earlier puberty in females. Of note, all findings remained significant in sensitivity analyses controlling for the pubertal stage. Interestingly, reward-related clinical characteristics were more common in the BD  group, including comorbid eating disorders, higher BMI, and history of nicotine use. \n\nThe findings of this study should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design precludes any inferences of causation or directionality. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate whether these connectivity patterns precede self-harm, and whether they vary over time and/or in relation to mood or suicidality. Second, the observational design may not be as sensitive as experimental paradigm approaches probing responses to emotion, reward, and/or suicide-related tasks. Third, we selected regions of interest that were most strongly supported by prior studies in both youth BD and self-harm, and recognize that there are other potential seeds of interest such as the insular cortex, ventrolateral PFC, and habenula. Fourth, this study examined a single analytic approach and a single neuroimaging phenotype. Future studies examining independent component analyses of rsFC, diffusion tensor imaging, gray matter structure, and cerebral blood flow are needed to provide further insights regarding the brain circuits, structures, and processes involved in self-harm. Fifth, as with most BD studies, there was substantial heterogeneity within our BD sample in terms of medication status and clinical profile (i.e. current mood state, BD subtype, psychiatric comorbidity, family psychiatric history). While more homogeneous approaches offer certain advantages, our goal was to generate findings that are broadly relevant in clinical populations, which are uniformly characterized by such heterogeneity. Sixth, despite research linking specific cognitive processes with functional brain regions, our inferences about cognitive processes involved in our findings are tentative and task-based fMRI studies are needed to confirm these associations. Last, this study was not sufficiently powered to examine functional connectivity of suicide attempts and NSSI separately, and there may be important phenotypic differences between these behaviors. In addition to intent, which is part of the distinction among NSSI and suicide attempts, the frequency and medical severity of self-harm warrants evaluation in future studies. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to examine these behaviors and related characteristics separately. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, this study found two consistent patterns of rsFC related to self-harm. The first pattern can be characterized as a putative indicator of self-harm risk: BD  had increased connectivity compared to BD  and HC adolescents from the OFC to the precuneus and cingulate cortex. The second pattern might be characterized as putatively resilient: BD  adolescents demonstrated greater connectivity between the (1) amygdala seed and occipital and frontal regions, and (2) dlPFC seed and frontal regions compared to both BD  and HC adolescents. To our knowledge, there have been no prior studies examining the rsFC of self-harm within adolescent BD. As such, this study provides preliminary inferences regarding the neurobiology of self-harm among adolescents with BD, a group at extraordinarily high risk of suicide. With continued efforts, this line of research has the potential to yield objective indicators of self-harm risk that might assist with risk stratification and, ultimately, influence the process of selecting, targeting, and monitoring the effects of various preventive and treatment interventions for self-harm. In the interim, present findings may help reduce the blame, bias, and disadvantage faced by adolescents with mood disorders and self-harm (Cvinar,  ). \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"d9bc05d5d14df917bb10aa165c551811"},

And all participants underwent structural and functional MRI scanning. The default-mode network (DMN) was extracted by independent component analysis (ICA), and regional functional connectivity strengths were calculated and compared among groups. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared to MCI patients, The DMN of MCI-SD patients demonstrated weaker functional connectivity with left middle frontal gyrus, right superior marginal gyrus, but stronger connectivity with the left parahippocampus, left precuneus and left middle temporal gyrus. Compared to the SD group, MCI-SD patients demonstrated weaker functional connectivity with right transverse temporal gyrus (Heschl’s gyrus), right precentral gyrus, and left insula, but stronger connectivity with posterior cerebellum, right middle occipital gyrus, and left precuneus. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nPatients with MCI-SD show unique changes in brain network connectivity patterns compared to MCI or SD alone, likely reflecting a broader functional disconnection and the need to recruit more brain regions for functional compensation. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe incidence and prevalence of dementia are rising in many regions due to population aging. According to estimates by Alzheimer’s Disease International, more than 50 million people worldwide had dementia in 2019, and this number will increase to 152 million by 2050 ( ). Dementia results in impairment of learning, memory, understanding, orientation, computation and other cognitive functions. With disease progression, the patient gradually loses the ability for self-care, placing a heavy burden on both the family and healthcare system. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, accounting for about 50–70% of all cases ( ). While many AD risk genes have been identified and neurodegeneration strongly linked to the formation of extracellular plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), there are still no broadly effective therapies. MCI is a borderline between normal aging and dementia and is widely considered a precursor to AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Since MCI has the potential to remain stable and not deteriorate or even reverse into a normal cognitive state, it has become a goal to study the transition mechanism of MCI to AD and how to effectively prevent its further development. \n\nSD almost always occur in people with cognitive impairment, and 25–40% of AD patients may have sleep disturbance in the early disease stages even before the appearance of cognitive dysfunction ( ). Patients with MCI are more than three times more likely to have overall poor sleep than cognitive healthy controls ( ). A study of 431 patients with cognitive impairment found that patients with AD and MCI had almost the same frequency of any sleep disturbance ( ). SD associated with AD and MCI are manifested primarily as prolonged sleep onset latency/difficulty falling asleep, disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythm, frequent nighttime waking ( ), and excessive daytime sleepiness ( ). Numerous studies have found that sleep disturbance and AD-associated cognitive impairments are mutually reinforcing, with sleep disturbance accelerating cognitive deterioration, and Aβ accumulation producing a direct negative effect on sleep function ( ;  ). Among the first neuropsychiatric deficits in AD is memory loss. Sleep helps to integrate and consolidate memories, so long-term SD can further impair memory ( ). These strong reciprocal associations suggest shared pathomechanisms. Indeed,   found significant elevations of Aβ42, P-tau, and T-tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as reduced metabolic rate in the medial temporal lobe of sleep apnea patients. Others have reported that nocturnal awakenings were associated with Aβ burden in the precuneus ( ). Moreover, nocturnal awakenings were found to be an intermediary between Aβ and cognitive impairment ( ). A sustained decrease in sleep duration may also increase Aβ load in the angular gyrus, anterior and posterior cingulate, precuneus and frontal lobes ( ).   found that sleep deprivation exacerbated cognitive dysfunction, induced morphological changes to hippocampal neurons, and increased senile plaque formation in the hippocampus and temporal cortex of APP/PS1 double transgenic AD model mice. In addition, sleep loss also disrupts normal Aβ metabolism by affecting the lymphatic system, hypocretin system, and neuroinflammatory responses, ultimately leading to pathological damage ( ;  ;  ). Since sleep disorders can interact with each other and form a vicious cycle, the early intervention of sleep disorders can improve the cognitive status of patients, reduce the risk of AD and delay its progression. \n\nRS-fMRI is a non-invasive neuroimaging method that can identify abnormalities in resting state brain networks associated with MCI and SD without specific task requirements. With the gradual maturity of the research techniques and methods of resting state, technical advances in RS-fMRI have demonstrated functional connectivity patterns associated with specific cognitive processes as well as abnormalities associated with neurological diseases. For instance, imaging of low-frequency blood oxygen signals from the whole brain combined with ICA has been used to distinguish among different resting state networks, such as the DMN, salience network (SN), and cognitive control network (CCN). The high synchronicity of activity among these brain regions suggests collective contributions to specific neurological functions ( ). In the resting state, the brain is not processing external tasks, but a cluster of regions termed the “default mode network” remains active to support internal mental states and monitor the external environment to cope with unforeseen events ( ;  ). A large number of previous RS-fMRI studies have found abnormal functional connectivity changes in the DMN of MCI and AD patients and strong associations between these changes and neuropsychiatric symptoms ( ;  ). \n\nNumerous studies have shown specific functional changes in the DMN among MCI and SD patients, but few have analyzed such network alteration in patients with comorbid MCI and sleep disorders. Therefore, this study compared DMN connectivity among MCI, SD, and MCI-SD patients to identify network alterations that may explain the strong association and interaction between these disorders. We hypothesized that MCI-SD patients would show disrupted connectivity among both memory- and sleep-related areas within resting state networks, and that these disruptions would be more severe than in MCI or SD alone. It is well-known that the hippocampus and its surrounding regions are important brain regions involved in the encoding of explicit memory. Previous studies have also shown that compared with healthy participants, the functional characteristics of the hippocampus and surrounding regions have significantly changed in MCI patients ( ). In addition, as the main regions of the default network, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and retrosplenial cingulate cortex (RSCC) are also closely associated with episodic memory or autobiographical memory ( ;  ). Moreover, evidence has supported characteristic changes of the precuneus, and cingulate cortex in functional patterns of MCI patient ( ;  ). A meta-analysis suggested that the changes of brain functional connectivity in sleep disorders are correlated with the DMN, SN, CCN, and the affect network (AN) ( ). Their changes are not only within each network, but also interact with each other, showing dynamic characteristic functional connectivity changes with the development of sleep disorders. Within DMN network, it was mainly manifested in the medial prefrontal lobe, precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and temporal lobe. Therefore, we hypothesized that significant changes in characteristic functions of the hippocampus and related peripheral regions, precuneus, PCC/ACC, temporal lobe, and prefrontal lobe would be mainly observed. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were recruited from inpatients and outpatients of Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital and Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. They were all right-handed and of Han nationality. All MCI patients met the following criteria: (1) Chief complaint of memory loss confirmed by family, or physician, (2) Objective impairment in memory or in one other area of cognitive function as evident by scores > 1.5 S.D. below the mean of the same age and education group, (3) Normal global cognitive function, and the cut-off points of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were 17 (illiterate), 20 (elementary school graduate), and 24 (junior high school graduate or above), (4) [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 0.5, 5] Normal or slightly impaired activities of daily living (ADL score ≤ 16/56 subscale), and (6) Absence of dementia. \n\nAll sleep disorder patients met the following criteria: (1) confirmed diagnosis according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), (2) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score ≥ 8 ( ), and (3) no obvious cognitive impairment or history of other mental and neurological diseases. Participants in the MCI-SD group met the inclusion criteria of both MCI and SD. \n\nExclusion criteria for all candidates were as follows: (1) other neurodegenerative diseases, brain trauma, or cerebrovascular diseases, (2) serious heart, liver, or renal insufficiency, (3) history of poorly controlled diabetes or other major metabolic diseases, (4) secondary insomnia caused by alcohol, drug dependence, physical disease, or schizophrenia, (5) HAMD score ≥ 7 (indicative of clinical anxiety), and (6) other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea syndrome and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Finally, a total of 60 participants were included in this study, 20 each with MCI, SD, or 20 MCI-SD. All participants met the physical requirements of MRI examination. Each participant gave written informed consent to participate. Each of them was scheduled for imaging on the same day after completing the neuropsychological measurements. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital and has been conducted in accord with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. \n\n\n### Data Acquisition \n  \nAll images were acquired using a Siemens 3 T Magnetom Trio MRI. Participants were instructed to remain awake but with eyes closed and head still and try not to think of anything specifically. Structural images were obtained by T1 imaging in the sagittal plane using the following parameters: sagittal scanning, 176 slices, thickness/gap = 1.0/0 mm, field of view [FOV = 200 × 200 mm , repetition time (TR) = 1,900 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.13 ms, and inversion time (TI) = 900 ms]. Resting state fMRI images were acquired by axial scanning using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence as follows: slices = 33, TE = 30 ms, TR = 2,000 ms, flip angle = 90°, slice thickness = 3.5 mm, matrix = 64 × 64, and FOV = 200 × 200 mm . \n\n\n### Analysis of Resting State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data \n  \n#### Preprocessing \n  \nIn this study, we focused on changes in the functional connectivity pattern of the DMN using RS-fMRI. Preprocessing of the RS-FMRI data was performed using SPM12 software  running on the Matlab platform. Participants with head motion exceeding 3 mm in translation and 3° in rotation during the RS-fMRI scan have been eliminated. First, to eliminate signal instability at the beginning of the scan, all resting state DICOM image data were converted to *.hdr and format using the dcm2nii tool of MRIcron software.  Then, the first 5 time points were eliminated. Standard preprocessing was performed on the remaining functional images, including head motion correction, slice timing correction, spatial normalization to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template with resampling to 3 × 3 × 3 mm , and spatial smoothing using an 8 mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel. All smoothed images were then bandpass filtered (0.01–0.1 Hz) and detrended to reduce low-frequency drift and physiological high-frequency respiratory and cardiac noise. Finally, we selected Friston 24 to remove covariates, mainly the effects of head movement, whole brain signal, white matter signal and cerebrospinal fluid on low frequency synchronous oscillation signal. \n\n\n#### Independent Component Analysis \n  \nAfter preprocessing, 25 independent components of the resting state data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) software (GIFTversion4.0b).  The main procedures consisted of (1) principal component analysis (PCI) of each subject dataset to reduce the number of dimensions, (2) ICA, and (3) data reconstruction. GIFT software was used to calculate and identify the components, and the number of components was 71. GIFT’s Display GUI module displayed all the components of all the participants, but no ideal brain network was extracted. According to prior knowledge and previous studies ( ;  ), we selected 25 components to extract the default mode network, and the appropriate brain functional network was obtained. Then, the same components from each subject were extracted to form sub-packets. Covariance analysis was used to compare differences in functional connectivity Z-scores among groups [  q   < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected]. Functional networks were identified by spatially correlated program templates that matched standard templates, and visual checks were performed based on spatial topology, time series, and low-frequency content to exclude false networks arising from physiological and/or motor artifacts. The DMN was then selected for comparative analysis. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic Data and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Score, Mini-Mental State Examination Score \n  \nThere were no differences in mean age, sex ratio, and education level among MCI, SD, and MCI -SD groups ( ). As expected according to group stratification criteria, PSQI scores were markedly higher in the SD group (16.00 ± 1.17) and MCI-SD group (11.90 ± 2.80) compared to the MCI group (3.70 ± 1.03) (  P   < 0.01) ( ).

There were significant differences in functional connectivity values within all three groups [  P   < 0.001 by one-sample   t  -test, (FDR) corrected]. Group-level images of the DMN are presented in  . In the MCI group, the bilateral precuneus, bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral internal frontal gyrus, left superior margin gyrus, right posterior central gyrus, and bilateral angular gyrus showed significantly positive connectivity, while the inferior parietal lobule, parahippocampus, and cerebellar tonsil exhibited significantly negative connectivity. In the SD group, bilateral precuneus, bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral internal frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, right posterior central gyrus, and bilateral angular gyrus demonstrated significantly positive connectivity, while bilateral inferior parietal lobule and bilateral fusiform gyrus showed significantly negative connectivity. Finally, in the MCI-SD group, bilateral precuneus, bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral angular gyrus, and cerebellar tonsil showed positive connectivity, whereas left internal frontal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, and putamen demonstrated negative connectivity. \n  \n (A)   Regions showing significant differences in default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity (FC) among Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients.

These were also significant differences in functional connectivity among groups (  P   < 0.001 by Covariance analysis).   and   show these paired comparison results. Compared to the SD group, the MCI group DMN exhibited stronger functional connectivity with the left inferior temporal gyrus and left lingual gyrus, while no DMN brain regions exhibited weaker connectivity. Compared to the MCI group, the MCI-SD group DMN exhibited weaker functional connectivity with the left middle frontal gyrus, right superior marginal gyrus, and stronger functional connectivity with the left parahippocampus, left precuneus, and left middle temporal gyrus. Finally, compared to the SD group, the MCI-SD group DMN demonstrated stronger functional connectivity with the posterior cerebellum, right middle occipital gyrus, and left precuneus, and weaker functional connectivity with the right transverse temporal gyrus (Heschl’s gyrus), right precentral gyrus, and left insula. \n  \n (A)   Regions showing significant differences in DMN FC between the MCI group and SD group.

The DMN of three groups all showed bilateral precuneus, bilateral anterior cingulate, and bilateral angular gyrus significantly positive activation. The MCI and SD groups additionally showed significant positive connectivity of bilateral medial frontal gyrus, right postcentral gyrus. These similarities in DMN alterations again suggest shared pathomechanisms between MCI and SD. We used covariance analysis to compare the differences of functional connectivity in DMN among the three groups. When compared with the MCI group, the MCI-SD group showed increased functional connectivity in the left precuneus, left parahippocampus, and left middle temporal gyrus, while when compared with the SD group, the functional connectivity of the left precuneus, right middle occipital gyrus, and posterior cerebellum were increased. \n\nThe precuneus, medial temporal lobe (including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and the entorhinal cortex etc.), cingulate gyrus, and prefrontal lobe are currently considered to be important regions related to episodic memory ( ). The precuneus contributes to high-level cognitive functions, including episodic and working memory retrieval, attention, and conscious perception, through strong connectivity with subcortical structures of the limbic system, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus ( ). Another part of the limbic system, the anterior cingulate gyrus, is involved in cognitive control, distribution of attention, emotion regulation, working memory, and reward response ( ). The angular gyrus is also involved in the processing of various cognitive information such as memory retrieval, attention, and theory of mind. In general, the left prefrontal lobe is mainly involved in encoding and storing memories, while the right prefrontal lobe is more involved in retrieving memories ( ). In elderly persons without cognitive impairment, the integrity and functional connectivity of the DMN decline with age ( ). Changes to multiple DMN components may occur in the elderly brain over time and these changes may indicate a loss of functional regulation ( ). The functional changes in these brain regions may be reflected in the normal “aging” decline in cognitive functions such as memory and attention, but the specific pathological changes in MCI make this functional change pattern different. In the resting state, some DMN regions showed significant activation, such as the precuneus, anterior cingulate gyrus, parts of the prefrontal cortex. It may reflect impairments in memory, cognition, and other functions in the three groups, which were compensated by compensatory mechanisms in the brain. Compensatory neuroplasticity allows one region to assume the functions of another following damage, and this process may require alterations in regional functional connectivity ( ). The degree of cognitive disability from neurodegenerative diseases depends in part on the amount of cognitive reserve accrued through education, ongoing intellectual activities, and social activities ( ). The precuneus, anterior cingulate, and middle frontal gyrus are thought to be associated with cognitive reserve ( ). Education, intellectual activities, and social activities are negatively correlated with resting state metabolic activities and/or cerebral blood flow in different cortical and subcortical regions.   found that elderly AD patients showed greater activation in brain regions related to cognitive reserve compared to healthy elderly people, suggesting compensation by other memory-related brain regions. A study by   found that with the development of the disease and the damage to the frontal lobes, the brain may exhibit compensatory redistribution of remaining lobar function. They observed that nodular centrality in the left middle frontal gyrus and left superior medial frontal gyrus was significantly higher in the AD group than in the MCI or HC groups. The centrality of left middle frontal gyrus nodules in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group was significantly higher than that in the severe cognitive impairment group. Decreased functional connectivity in the posterior default mode network and increased anterior and abdominal default mode network were observed in early AD, and connectivity in all regions decreased significantly as the disease progressed to the middle and late stages of AD, which supports the theory that the early compensatory effect occurred within the DMN ( ). Compensatory effects also occur in MCI, and many studies have found a general decrease in DMN functional connectivity in MCI patients, or decreased activation at resting state, such as in the hippocampus and lateral parietal cortex ( ), and the cuneus/precuneus ( ), but increased resting state activation in these and other regions has also been observed ( ). Reduced functional connectivity is thought to be associated with memory decline, while increased activity could be a compensation for damage by recruitment of other regions ( ). Some studies have suggested that compensatory effects may also occur in the elderly without neurodegenerative diseases, showing increased activation in the anterior brain areas and decreased activation in the posterior DMN areas, and proposed a “Posterior Anterior Shift in Aging (PASA)” model. However, some scholars put forward the model is not suitable for explaining all findings, because some older subjects failed in generating anterior DMN areas compensatory ( ). \n\nIn addition to the common characteristics mentioned above, the following diversities are also worth noting. First, the parahippocampus, cerebellar tonsil, and inferior parietal lobule in the MCI group showed lower activation than other brain regions in the DMN network. However, no significant differences in the relevant regions were observed between the SD group and the MCI-SD group, and when compared with MCI, the MCI-SD group showed stronger functional connectivity in the left parahippocampus and the left precuneus. According to previous studies ( ), the precuneus is considered to be an important gateway between the medial temporal lobe and other parts of the cerebral cortex involved in episodic memory. MMSE scores showed less cognitive impairment in the MCI-SD group than in the MCI group. Therefore, the enhanced functional connectivity between the left parhippocampal and left precuneus may contribute to the preserved cognitive function in the MCI-SD group. Since this study did not measure the correlation between MMSE and FC and the left region, the speculation needs careful consideration. Because DMN remains active in the resting state to consolidate the contents of memory ( ), functional connectivity may increase compensatively to make up for the corresponding loss of memory function in the case of impaired white matter ( ). It is also worth noting that when making comparation within MCI-SD group, we observed asynchronous activation of bilateral precuneus and right middle temporal gyrus, implying a separation of functional connectivity between them. The inferior temporal cortex (including the middle temporal gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus) was inhibited as a repository of long-term visual memory in MCI patients, whereas healthy controls tended to show stronger interaction between the right inferior temporal cortex and other regions of the DMN ( ). We noticed the same thing in the MCI-SD group. However, when compared with the MCI group, the MCI-SD group demonstrated enhanced functional connectivity between the left middle temporal gyrus, the precuneus and the parhippocampal gyrus. In combination with the preceding analysis, we hypothesized that the enhanced functional connectivity was also intended to compensate for the functional loss of the right inferior temporal cortex. We can’t really tell if this compensation pattern exists in MCI patients because we don’t have a healthy control group. However, it is possible that the MCI-SD group needs to recruit more regions for functional compensation. \n\nA study by   on the interaction of SD and AD   in vivo   proposed a “bipolar model” of the Alzheimer’s disease spectrum. The model suggests that with the progression of cognitive impairment, brain functional connectivity appears as compensatory effects of MCI and decompensated effects of AD ( ). The brain has certain neuroplasticity and functional compensation mechanism. When the damage is mild, the brain or DMN may guarantee the realization of daily functions through functional reorganization. With the further aggravation of cognitive damage, the compensation mechanism is gradually unable to be sustained, and eventually progress to the “decompensated effect” of AD patients ( ). We speculate that sleep disorders may accelerate this decompensation process, that is, MCI patients with sleep disorders may show more decreased activation of DMN brain regions or a more extensive compensatory effect than MCI patients. As observed in this study, the MCI-SD group showed more extensive disruption of internal functional connectivity in the DMN and more compensatory effects than that in the MCI group when the cognitive function was more preserved. This may be explained by the fact that MCI patients with sleep disorders “overdraw” the compensatory capacity of these brain regions earlier, and therefore, may fall into the abyss of “decompensation” faster. \n\nSecond, when compared with the MCI or SD groups, DMN in the MCI-SD group showed positive activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and negative connectivity in the left internal frontal gyrus, indicating greater separation of functional synchronization within the prefrontal lobe. In the meantime, the MCI-SD group seemed to have reduced functional connectivity between the left middle frontal gyrus, right superior marginal gyrus, and left calcarine sulcus when compared to the MCI group. Previous studies have suggested that posterior DMN (including precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and lateral parietal cortex) shows decreased connectivity in the early stages of AD, while anterior DMN (concentrated in the medial prefrontal cortex) shows increased connectivity and decreases with disease progression ( ). Under such a premise, the reduced functional connectivity in the MCI-SD group between prefrontal cortex and the post-DMN region may be interpreted as SDs accelerated the disconnectivity progress in MCI patients. This conjecture needs to be further proved in a larger sample. \n\nThirdly, there were significant differences between the MCI-SD group and the MCI group or the SD group. In brief, the regions with significant differences in functional connectivity were concentrated within the DMN in the MCI-SD group compared with those of the MCI group; while compared with the SD group, the functional connectivity between DMN and external brain regions showed significant differences (In the analysis, we mainly focused on DMN, but when using ICA to extract DMN, the extracted brain network covered a small part of the regions outside DMN, so we observed such a result). The functional connectivity between the precuneus and the right middle occipital gyrus was increased. The occipital lobe mainly processes visual information, and its damage to the occipital lobe will lead to the decline of visual-spatial and executive abilities ( ). An fMRI-based study of patients with primary insomnia found reduced functional connectivity between the middle occipital gyrus and the posterior cingulate gyrus, which are considered related to reduced daytime executive function in these patients ( ). This result seems to be contrary to that of the present study. However, due to the different reference participants and the small sample size of this study, it is unclear whether these functional connectivity differences truly reflected the specific brain functional patterns in MCI-SD patients, which still needs further studies. In addition, functional connectivity between the precuneus and posterior cerebellum was enhanced in the MCI-SD group. Another study found that SD also disrupt functional connectivity within the cerebellum and between cerebellum and its functional connectivity to DMN ( ). Anatomy and imaging have found that the majority of the cerebellum link to cerebral association networks important to cognition. Some studies have also observed that the cerebellum is related to cognitive, emotional, and behavioral control, although the specific mechanism of how the cerebellum participates in it needs further research ( ;  ). Therefore, we assumed that the enhanced functional connectivity between precuneus and posterior cerebellar lobes in MCI-SD was attributed to the compensatory mechanism of the cognitive impairment, and explained the sleep-related impairment in the MCI-SD group to some extent. However, there were significant differences in other sleep-related brain regions of the MCI-SD group. A decreased functional connectivity between the left insula and the right postcentral gyrus was examined in the MCI-SD group with that of the SD group. The insula is a complex region that involved in cognitive control processes, sensorimotor, and affective processes by making extensive connections to other brain functional regions ( ). The insula has been proposed to integrate external sensory information with internal signals of emotional and physical states, and plays a crucial role in emotional experience and subjective feelings, all of which have been proposed to play a role in insomnia ( ;  ). The postcentral gyrus is the core region of the CCN, that is responsible for senior cognitive tasks like working memory and selective attention ( ). Patients with long-term insomnia also presented a reduced functional activity in this brain region ( ). Taken together, the abnormal functional connectivity between the insula and the cerebellum in the MCI-SD group were not only affected by sleep disorders, but also the result of MCI-related cognitive impairment. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nPatients with comorbid MCI and SD exhibited more extensive changes in functional connectivity among DMN regions than patients with SD or MCI alone, possibly reflecting greater disruption of normal pathways and compensatory remodeling of network organization. Moreover, patients with MCI-SD may tend to recruit more compensatory function at the stage of relative retention of cognitive function. These changes were mainly manifested in enhanced compensatory functional connectivity in brain regions associated with cognitive impairment such as precuneus, anterior cingulate gyrus, angular gyrus, and parahippocampus, as well as impaired functional connectivity in sleep-related regions such as anterior central gyrus, insula, and cerebellum. In addition, MCI-SD patients also showed extensive separation of functional connectivity pathways among the internal frontal lobe, internal occipital lobe, temporal lobe, and cerebellum compared to patients with MCI alone. \n\nThis study still has many limitations, including the following aspects. First, our sample size is relatively small, which may produce a large sample bias. Besides, our results must be interpreted with some caution. Although both MCI and SD groups were taken as controls in the present study, a healthy control group would make our analysis of altered brain connectivity patterns in MCI-SD patients with sleep disorder more convincing. Subsequent study designs can be improved on this basis, and further statistical analysis of the connectivity between cognitive function score and brain function can be conducted. Thirdly, since MCI can be transformed not only into AD, but also into other types of dementia, we selected patients with MCI in general and did not explore them in depth, such as amnestic MCI and non-amnestic MCI. A longitudinal study found that MCI patients who progressed to AD 2–3 years later had a more severe decline in functional connectivity than MCI patients whose disease remained stable ( ). Predominantly memory decline aMCI was also different from non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI-SD) in terms of functional connectivity ( ). Lastly, different sleep disorders can be evaluated more objectively. Sleep disorder is a broad definition, including seven major categories that include insomnia disorders, sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, parasomnias, and other sleep disorder ( ). In this study, only the PSQI was used to assess the sleep quality of the three groups of participants. Follow-up studies could analyze the effects of different sleep disorders on the changes in brain functional connectivity in Alzheimer’s patients. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital.

As increasing interests in multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches, such as combining structural MRI, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), there is a need to construct integrated brain atlases based on these three imaging modalities. This study constructed a multi-modal brain atlas for a Chinese aging population (n = 180, age: 22–79 years), which consists of a T1 atlas showing the brain morphology, a high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) atlas delineating the complex fiber architecture, and a rs-fMRI atlas reflecting brain intrinsic functional organization in one stereotaxic coordinate. We employed large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) and unbiased diffeomorphic atlas generation to simultaneously generate the T1 and HARDI atlases. Using spectral clustering, we generated 20 brain functional networks from rs-fMRI data. We demonstrated the use of the atlas to explore the coherent markers among the brain morphology, functional networks, and white matter tracts for aging and gender using joint independent component analysis. \n  \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background & Summary \n  \nBrain atlases have received a great deal of attention , since they play important roles in studying anatomy and function of the brain in large populations . Recently, there is an increasing interest in using multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches, such as structural MRI, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), for understanding brain development, degeneration, and abnormalities of gray matter and white matter tracts as well as functional organization. There is a need to construct integrated brain atlases based on structural MRI, DWI, and rs-fMRI such that the convoluted cortex, subcortical structures, white matter tracts, and functional networks are well aligned in a common stereotaxic coordinate space. \n\nThe well-known brain atlas, such as the MNI  and ICBM  atlases, was constructed based on structural T1-weighted images of Caucasian populations. Evidence has shown population differences in brain morphology among various ethnic groups . In the past few years, several brain atlases targeting the Chinese population became available. Xing   et al  . constructed a set of brain structural atlases for various age and gender groups using 1000 Chinse adults . The brain of Chinese is rounder in shape , shorter in length and height but has a larger width to length ratio  than that of Caucasians. Liang   et al  . utilized the population-matched brain structural atlas and achieved better segmentation performance for Chinese subjects than using those Caucasians-based brain structural atlases . Yang   et al  . constructed a brain surface atlas based on a Chinese population and demonstrated better alignment and higher accuracy when registering a Chinese brain to the Chinese brain atlas compared to the brain atlas derived from a Caucasian population . Functionally, Zhang   et al  ., found that the language-related brain region was more strongly connected with the motor area and frontal region in Chinese compared to Caucasians . Thus, there is a need to construct ethnic-specific brain structural and functional atlases. \n\nDiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been widely explored to understand the microstructure of the brain white matter based on the diffusion property of water molecules . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is the well-used model to quantify water diffusion . Mori   et al  . constructed a DTI white matter atlas where projection and association white matter fibers are characterized in stereotaxic coordinates . However, since DTI describes the axonal orientation of each voxel by a three-dimensional ellipsoid tensor, it has limited capability to resolve the complex architecture of crossing fibers . To address the issue of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations, more complex diffusion imaging teachniques, such as high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) , diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI)  and q-ball imaging (QBI) , have been developed to recover complex fiber architecture via an orientation distribution function (ODF), where the ODF is the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules that characterizes white matter fiber orientations. Bloy   et al  . constructed the HARDI atlas for adolescents and employed an automated clustering algorithm to parcellate the white matter into regions with higher homogeneity of white matter fibers than those derived from conventional DTI . Nevertheless, up to date, a Chinese-population-based brain structural atlas capable of modeling complex intravoxel fiber orientations is still missing. Also, there is a lack of brain atlases that integrate comprehensive white matter fibers and functional organization. \n\nThis study aimed to construct a multi-modal brain atlas for a Chinese aging population (age: 22 to 79 years), which consists of a structural T1 atlas showing the brain morphology, a HARDI atlas delineating the complex fiber architecture, and a rs-fMRI atlas reflecting brain intrinsic functional organization. We employed large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM)  and unbiased diffeomorphic atlas generation  to simultaneously generate the structural T1 and HARDI atlases. Using spectral clustering, we generated 20 brain functional networks from rs-fMRI data. Further, we demonstrated the use of the atlas to explore the coherent markers among the brain morphology, functional networks, and white matter tracts for aging and gender using joint independent component analysis (ICA). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThis study was approved by the National University of Singapore Institutional Review Board and all participants provided written informed consent prior to participation. \n\nTwo hundred and fourteen healthy Chinese subjects aged 22 to 79 years old were recruited and screened for this study . Chinese ethnicity was defined when both parents and grandparents are Chinese. Subjects with the following conditions were excluded: (1) major illnesses/surgery (heart, brain, kidney, lung surgery); (2) neurological or psychiatric disorders; (3) learning disability or attention deficit; (4) head injury with loss of consciousness; (5) non-removable metal objects on/in the body such as cardiac pacemaker; (6) diabetes or obesity; (7) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score less than 24. Additionally, this study included subjects with three brain image modalities, including T1-weighted MRI, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), and high angular resolution diffusion image (HARDI) with small head motion . As a result, this study included 180 subjects from 22 to 79 years old (77 males, 103 females). Figure   illustrates the age and sex distribution of subjects included in this study.   \nAge and sex distribution of subjects in this study. \n  \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nAll subjects were scanned using a 3 T Siemens Magnetom Trio Tim scanner with a 32-channel head coil at the Clinical Imaging Research Centre of the National University of Singapore. The image protocols included: (i) high-resolution isotropic T -weighted Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Recalled Echo (MPRAGE; 192 slices, 1 mm thickness, sagittal acquisition, field of view 256 × 256 mm , matrix = 256 × 256, repetition time = 2300 ms, echo time = 1.90 ms, inversion time = 900 ms, flip angle = 9°); (ii) isotropic axial resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) imaging protocol (single-shot echo-planar imaging; 48 slices with 3 mm slice thickness, no inter-slice gaps, matrix = 64 × 64, field of view = 192 × 192 mm , repetition time = 2300 ms, echo time = 25 ms, flip angle = 90°, scanning time = 8 min); (iii) isotropic high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI; 48 slices of 3 mm thickness, with no inter-slice gaps, matrix: 96 × 96, field of view: 256 × 256 mm , repetition time: 6800 ms, echo time: 85 ms, flip angle: 90°, 91 diffusion weighted images (DWIs) with b = 1150 s/mm , 11 baseline images without diffusion weighting); (iv) isotropic T -weighted imaging protocol (spin echo sequence; 48 slices with 3 mm slice thickness, no inter-slice gaps, matrix: 96 × 96, field of view: 256 × 256 mm , repetition time: 2600 ms, echo time: 99 ms, flip angle: 150°). During the rs-fMRI scan, the subjects were asked to close their eyes. \n\nThe T -weighted images were corrected for intensity inhomogeneity and were then skull-stripped using FreeSurfer (version 5.3.0) . A post-processing quality check was conducted by one well-trained researcher based on the instruction given at  . \n\nThe rs-fMRI data were preprocessed with slice timing, motion correction, skull stripping, band-pass filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz) and grand mean scaling of the data (to whole brain modal value of 100). Framewise displacement (head motion characteristics) was computed, and subjects with rs-fMRI data of framewise displacement (FD) greater than 0.5 mm were excluded from this study . Figure   shows the mean framewise displacement distribution of rs-fMRI data among subjects. All the subjects in this study had the mean FD smaller than 0.2 mm. Among them, 90% had the mean FD smaller than 0.1 mm. Hence, head motion is regressed out from rs-fMRI using six parameters, and subsequently, this study regressed out CSF and white matter signals from rs-fMRI signal. Temporal band-pass filtering (0.01–0.08   Hz  ) was applied.   \nMean framewise displacement (FD) distribution. Mean FD were smaller than 0.2 mm for all subjects, among which 90% had mean FD smaller than 0.1 mm. \n  \n\nDWIs of each subject were first corrected for motion and eddy current distortions using mutual information for searching affine transformation to the image without diffusion weighting in FSL . Within-subject, we followed the procedure detailed in Huang   et al  .  to correct geometric distortion of the DWIs due to b -susceptibility differences over the brain. Briefly, the T -weighted image was considered as the anatomical reference. The deformation that carried the baseline image without diffusion weighting to the T -weighted image characterized the geometric distortion of the DWI. For this, intra-subject registration was first performed using FLIRT  to remove linear transformation (rotation and translation) between the diffusion weighted images and T -weighted image. Then, large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM)  sought the optimal nonlinear transformation that deformed the baseline image without the diffusion weighting to the T -weighted image. This diffeomorphic transformation was then applied to every diffusion weighted image in order to correct the nonlinear geometric distortion. The diffusion gradients were reoriented using the method proposed in Dhollander   et al  . . Finally, we estimated the orientation distribution functions (ODFs) using the approach considering the solid angle constraint based on HARDI proposed in Aganj   et al  . . The ODF is the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules that characterizes white matter fiber orientations. \n\n\n### Structural atlas generation using t1-weighted and diffusion weighted images \n  \nThis study employed large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM)  to simultaneously generate multi-modal structural brain atlases, including structural T -weighted MRI and HARDI. We adopted the unbiased diffeomorphic atlas generation procedure given in literature . In particular, we formulated this atlas generation as where   I  , Ψ  denote the structural T -weighted atlas and the HARDI atlas represented by ODFs.   ϕ   and   v   are diffeomorphic transformation and its velocity at time,   t  , that transform the estimated atlas to the   i   subject space . At   t   = 1,   ϕ   transforms the T -weighted and ODF atlases to the T -weighted and ODF images of the   i   subject, respectively.   is the regularization term to constraint the smoothness of the velocity field in a Hilbert space,   V  . ||  I  ∙  ϕ  -  I  ||  quantifies the intensity difference between the transformed T -weighted atlas and the T -weighted image of the   i   subject.   is defined as Fisher-Rao metric in the statistical manifold of ODFs. The mathematical definition of this Fisher-Rao metric was detailed in Du   et al  . . It quantifies the angle between the transformed atlas ODF, Ψ ∙  ϕ  , and the   i   subject ODF, Ψ . \n\nTo solve Eq. ( ), single-subject structural and HARDI ODF images were used as an initial atlas. Structural MRI and HARDI ODF of the initial atlas were simultaneously aligned to those of individual subjects via LDDMM transformations . The structural T -weighted atlas was obtained by averaging the deformed images of individuals. The HARDI atlas was computed by averaging the deformed ODF of individuals based on mean of ODFs in the ODF statistical manifold . We repeated this process for three iterations to obtain the final structural T -weighted image and HARDI ODF atlases as the intensity change of the atlases obtained from the second and third iterations was less than 5%. Last, we mapped manually labelled white matter parcels from the JHU-MNI-SS atlas  into the HARDI atlas via diffeomorphic transformation obtained using LDDMM, resulting in 94 deep white matter parcels (see the annotation in Supplementary Table  ). \n\nIn this study, we employed ODF to represent the direction of white matter fibers and scalar image, generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA), to quantify how the shape of ODF is deviated from a unit sphere. \n\n\n### Functional atlas parcellation \n  \nIn this study, the functional parcellation for the cortical and subcortical regions was constructed based on the rs-fMRI data of all subjects in the above structural atlas space. Individual rs-fMRI data were aligned to our structural T -weighted atlas created above via LDDMM between the respective T -weighted images. Given that spectral approaches are robust well-proven methods for parcellating the brain, as they are especially suitable for solving general problems, and tend to provide partitions with more balanced sizes compared to other clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering , we employed spectral clustering to construct the functional parcellation from rs-fMRI data . First, the gray matter mask was constructed by subtracting the white matter mask from the structural atlas, where the white matter mask contained 94 white matter parcels. Second, a voxel-pairwise similarity matrix was computed via Pearson’s correlation between the time course of any two voxels in the gray matter mask for individual subjects. Negative functional connectivities were retained and proceeded with the same computational procedure as for positive connectivities. A group similarity matrix was averaged across individual functional connectivity matrices and was then standardized to be maximum of one and minimum of zero. Third, spectral clustering was applied on the group average similarity matrix. Silhouette index that indicates the balance between intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster separation was used to determine the number of clusters . A higher value of the Silhouette index indicates a better clustering result. We shall call a functional cluster as a functional network in the rest of the paper. \n\nTo evaluate the reproducibility of the functional parcellation, we repeated the spectral clustering analysis via leave-one-out cross-validation. We then computed the overlap ratios between the new and original functional networks for each repetition . Moreover, we compared our parcellation with that generated by hierarchical clustering using Ward’s algorithm . Our study chose Wald’s hierarchical clustering method since it is a well-proved hierarchical clustering algorithm in terms of its robustness to generate the functional parcellation. Previous studies showed that Wald’s method is superior to several brain functional parcellation methods, such as geometric clustering and k-means clustering . Our study computed the overlap ratio between our parcellation and that generated from Wald’s hierarchical clustering method. \n\n\n\n## Data Records \n  \n### Structural MRI and hardi brain atlases \n  \nFigure   illustrates the structural T -weighted atlas (panel a) and HARDI GFA (panel b). The GFA, similar to FA, characterizes the overall shape of the white matter fiber distribution relative to a unit sphere. The larger GFA value (1 as max value) indicates more complex fiber orientation, while GFA of zero indicates that the ODF is in a spherical shape. Figure   shows the ODF in the midbrain, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). The first two show synchronized fiber orientation and the last one shows cross fibers in the SLF.   \nStructural atlas. Panels (  a  ,  b  ) respectively illustrate the structural T -weighted atlas and HARDI GFA atlas. Panel (  c  ) enlarges the white matter region in the dashed box and illustrates the ODF representing the orientation of white matter fibers. \n  \n\n\n### Resting-state functional brain atlas \n  \nThe spectral cluster algorithm identified 22 functional networks from the rs-fMRI data. Figure   illustrates Silhouette index, suggesting the maximal value of Silhouette index reached when the brain was classified into the 22 functional networks. Through the visual inspection, we discarded 2 functional networks that were mainly located at the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) regions, resulting in the final 20 functional networks. Figure   illustrates the 20 functional networks in the axial view of the brain and Fig.   provides the three views of each network. Supplementary Table   lists the descriptive information of the 20 functional networks.   \nResting-state functional atlas. This atlas consists of 20 functional networks that are illustrated in the axial view of the brain. \n    \nModel selection and reproducibility of brain functional parcellation. Silhouette index indicates that the gray matter region can be clustered into 22 functional networks (  a  ). leave-one-out cross-validation results showed the average overlap ratio between the reproduced results and our 20 meaningful functional networks derived from the full dataset across 20 meaningful functional networks was 80.3% (  b  ). The average overlap ratio between the parcellation results from Ward’s algorithm and 20 meaningful networks from our main analysis was 65.5% (  c  ). \n    \nThe 20 functional brain networks. \n  \n\n#### Cerebellar and subcortical networks \n  \nThe cerebellum was partitioned into two functional networks, including the left and right cerebellum, while the subcortical network included the basal ganglia and thalamus as well as the middle cingulate. The first row in Fig.   illustrates the two cerebellar networks and one subcortical network. \n\n\n#### Primary sensory networks \n  \nThe 20 functional networks included three primary sensory networks, namely, the sensory motor network located at the motor cortex, the primary visual network located at cuneus, and the lateral occipital network (the second row in Fig.  ). \n\n\n#### DMN and salience \n  \nThe default mode region was fractionated into three functional networks (the fourth row in Fig.  ). The precuneus, post cingulate, and angular gyrus made up the posterior default mode network (DMN). The medial frontal, anterior cingulate, and caudate were further clustered into the left and right anterior DMNs. \n\nSimilarly, the insula, putamen, and thalamus were fractionated into two unilateral functional networks, namely, the left and right salience (the first two panels on the third row in Fig.  ). \n\n\n#### Temporal networks \n  \nThe temporal lobe was partitioned into four functional networks. The middle temporal network was located at the middle temporal region (the first panel on the sixth row in Fig.  ), and the temporal network covered the temporal pole, hippocampus, parahippocampus, and amygdala (the first panel on the fifth row in Fig.  ). Both networks displayed bilateral patterns. The inferior and middle temporal regions were further partitioned into two unilateral functional networks, namely, the left and the right temporal functional networks (the fifth row in Fig.  ). \n\n\n#### Frontoparietal networks \n  \nThe frontoparietal cortex was clustered into five functional networks. The orbitofrontal network clearly delineated the orbitofrontal cortex. The attention network was located at the inferior parietal cortex and displayed a bilateral pattern. The executive control network showed a dispersed bilateral pattern in the parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex, but diminished the left counterpart in the superior frontal cortex. The superior frontal cortex together with the anterior cingulate and basal ganglia was further clustered into the left and right frontal networks (the last row in Fig.  ). \n\n\n\n### Integrated structural and functional atlas \n  \nFigure   illustrates the integrated structural and functional atlas, where the gray matter was parcellated into 20 functional networks and the white matter was segmented into 94 white matter tracts. The atlas and all the image data used in this paper are available at NITRC  .   \nIntegrated structural and functional brain atlas. The colored outline delineates the 20 functional networks, where the color scheme is consistent with those in Fig.  . The color map in the white matter shows the white matter parcellation. \n  \n\n\n\n## Technical Validation \n  \nFigure   demonstrates our structural atlases including the T -weighted atlas (panel a) and the HARDI GFA atlas (panel b) in comparison with well-established adult atlases created based on different ethnic subjects. Visually, our T -weighted atlas (panel a, (i)) offered better contrast than the MNI152 atlas (panel a, (ii)). The patterns of sulci and gyri in our T -weighted atlas were largely agreed with those in the MNI152 atlas (panel a, (ii)) and those in the IIT T  atlas  (panel a, (iii)). On the other hand, the anatomical details of the white matter are clearer in our HARDI GFA atlas (panel b, (i)) than those in the FMRIB58 FA atlas (FMRIB, Oxford, UK) (panel b, (ii)). Major white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum, corona radiata, internal capsule, external capsule, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and small features, including the anterior commissure and superficial white matters, in the IIT FA atlas  (panel b, (iii)) were observed in our HARDI GFA atlas as well (panel b, (i)).   \nComparison of structural atlases. Panel (  a  ) illustrates the structural T -weighted atlas in comparison with MNI152 T -weighted atlas (ii) and IITmean T -weighted atlas (iii). Panel (  b  ) illustrates the HARDI GFA atlas in comparison with FMRIB58 FA atlas (ii) and IITmean FA atlas (iii). \n  \n\nFigure   shows the reproducibility of functional parcellation through leave-one-out cross-validation. Among the 20 functional networks derived from the full dataset, the average overlap ratio between the reproduced results and those from our main analysis was 80.3%. The cerebellum and primary sensory networks, including the primary visual, lateral occipital, and sensory motor, demonstrated high consistency among reproduced results with an average overlap ratio greater than 90%. On the other hand, the subcortical network and association networks, including the attention, executive control, salience networks, default mode networks, and temporal networks, were relatively variable compared to the primary sensory networks. \n\nFigure   shows the overlap ratio of functional parcels using spectral clustering and those using Ward’s algorithm. The average overlap ratio between the parcellation scheme from Ward’s algorithm and that from our main analysis over all 20 meaningful functional networks was 65.5%. Similar to reproducibility results from leave-one-out cross-validation, the cerebellum and primary sensory networks from Ward’s algorithm were highly consistent with those derived from our main analysis, while higher-ordered functional networks from Ward’s algorithm, in general, showed a lower overlap ratio with those derived from our main analysis. Notably, three networks in the association cortex, namely, attention network and left and salience networks, were well reproduced via Ward’s algorithm. \n\n\n## Usage Notes \n  \nWe illustrated the use of the integrated structural and functional atlas to examine the synchronized pattern of the brain morphology, functional networks, and white matter tracts due to gender and age. For this, we applied joint independent component analysis (ICA) to incorporate the structure and functional measures. For functional data, we calculated the network-level functional connectivity matrix based on our 20 functional networks. For structural T1-weighted data, we employed cortical thickness to characterize the cortical ribbon. We mapped our age-appropriate functional atlas into cortical surfaces and calculated the cortical thickness averaged over each functional network. The average GFA value of each white matter tract was computed based on the HARDI atlas. As a result, the input matrix for multi-modal fusion consisted of 34 measures of thickness, 94 measures from the white matter parcels, and 210 functional connections, including 190 inter-network functional connections and 20 intra-network functional connections, from the functional atlas for each subject. \n\nWe chose 14 IC components based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) and minimum description length (MDL) estimation  (Fig.  ). Figure   illustrates the loadings for each IC. We then investigated the age and gender differences of those components based on Pearson’s correlation and   t  -test, respectively. The top row in Fig.   illustrates the IC with the largest negative loading. The loading of this component did not show significant age-related changes but displayed significant gender difference. This gender-related component consisted of the cortical thickness in the left frontal, orbitofrontal, and primary visual networks, the white matter tract connecting to the left temporal lobe, and the functional connectivity between the temporal region and attention network, posterior DMN, and lateral occipital network. This component may reflect the different brain recruitment during language tasks between males and females . The bottom row in Fig.   illustrates the IC with the largest positive loading that shows a significant age-related increase (scatter plot on the last panel). This age-related component consisted of the cortical thickness in the executive control network, functional connectivity between the right cerebellum and sensory motor and subcortical networks, between the subcortical and left anterior DMN, and dispersed white matter tracts connecting the subcortico-cerebellar region to the cerebral cortex. This component might reflect the age-related changes in the functional connectivity between the subcortical and cortical cortex.   \nJoint independent component analysis on cortical thickness, functional network connectivity, and GFA of white matter tracts.

We show our approach reliably identifies true cognitive state change points when applied on block‐design working memory task data and outperforms the standard sliding window approach in both accuracy and computational efficiency in this context. When applied to data from four resting state fMRI scanning sessions, our method consistently recovers five reliable FC states, and subject‐specific features derived from these states show significant correlation with behavioral phenotypes of interest (cognitive ability, personality).

Our approach accurately recovers known state transitions in the context of a structured working memory task, outperforming the popular sliding window approach. In resting data, our method identifies five dynamic states that are highly test‐retest reliable, exhibit complex transition dynamics, and are correlated with multiple behavioral phenotypes.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nOver the past two decades the study of functional connectivity (FC) has emerged as a preeminent method in cognitive and clinical neuroscience, aiming to characterize the functional network organization of the brain, and to identify objective markers of neuropsychiatric diseases and clinically relevant phenotypes. FC describes the interconnection (often computed as temporal correlation) in activation patterns of spatially distinct regions of the brain, typically measured by blood oxygen level‐dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Originally, the entire field of FC was built on a critical assumption: that patterns of connectivity are static during any given measurement interval in a resting state, that is, the absence of any cognitive task (Biswal, Yetkin, Haughton, & Hyde,  ). Static FC has been used to identify global differences in functional network organization of the brain between cognitive task states and resting state (Greicius, Krasnow, Reiss, & Menon,  ), as well as to characterize differences in FC between healthy controls and subjects with neuro‐psychiatric diagnoses, such as schizophrenia (Lynall,  ) or autism spectrum disorder (Hull et al.,  ). \n\nRecently, however, a number of studies have questioned this assumption, instead advocating the “dynamic” or “time‐varying” connectivity view that functional connectivity patterns exhibit substantial moment‐to‐moment changes over time, specifically within a standard fMRI measurement interval of 5 to 15 min (Calhoun, Miller, Pearlson, & Adalı,  ; Chang & Glover,  ; Cohen,  ; Hutchison et al.,  ; Lurie et al.,  ; Preti, Bolton, & Van De Ville,  ). These changing FC patterns are thought to correspond to cognitively meaningful discrete FC network configurations, or connectivity states, that are reproducible both within and between individual subjects. Dynamic states have been documented across different populations, including children (Marusak et al.,  ) and adults (Allen et al.,  ; Cai et al.,  ; Chen, Cai, Ryali, Supekar, & Menon,  ; Choe et al.,  ; Liu & Duyn,  ; Smith, Zhao, Keilholz, & Schumacher,  ), and have been supported with concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) data (Allen, Damaraju, Eichele, Wu, & Calhoun,  ; Chang, Liu, Chen, Liu, & Duyn,  ; Tagliazucchi, von Wegner, Morzelewski, Brodbeck, & Laufs,  ). Furthermore, it has been shown that other characteristics such as the amount of time spent in specific states and the number of transitions between states vary with meaningful individual differences such as age (Cabral et al.,  ; Hutchison & Morton,  ; Marusak et al.,  ), sex (Mao, Zheng, Long, Yao, & Wu,  ), or disease status (Cordes et al.,  ; Damaraju et al.,  ; Jones et al.,  ; Rashid, Damaraju, Pearlson, & Calhoun,  ). \n\nBy definition, the presence of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in resting state is marked by changes in the connectivity structure of the fMRI time series. The prevailing sliding window framework aims to identify these second‐order changes using functional connectivity “snapshots” obtained from time windows of fixed length slid across the entire fMRI time series. The resultant windowed connectomes are then flattened into feature vectors, concatenated across subjects, and clustered into   k   distinct connectivity states. Importantly, there are two distinct elements of the sliding window paradigm (windowing and connectome estimation) that present several methodological choices that can be mixed‐and‐matched to create numerous potential sliding window workflows. For example, the windowing step involves the choice of the size and shape of the window (Mokhtari, Akhlaghi, Simpson, Wu, & Laurienti,  ; Shakil, Billings, Keilholz, & Lee,  ; Shakil, Keilholz, & Lee,  ; Shakil, Lee, & Keilholz,  ), the optimal choice of which still constitutes an active area of research. There are also several choices of connectivity estimation, including Pearson correlation (Allen et al.,  ), Spearman correlation (Savva, Mitsis, & Matsopoulos,  ), instantaneous shared trajectory (Faghiri et al.,  ), and instantaneous phase synchrony (Pedersen, Omidvarnia, Zalesky, & Jackson,  ). Each of these methods presents its own benefits, but Pearson correlation is generally the most commonly used connectivity estimator in sliding window paradigms. The sliding window approach represents an important advance in the study of time‐varying brain connectivity, but it nonetheless suffers from several important limitations. \n\nFirst, the sliding window method relies heavily on the somewhat arbitrary choice of window size, and results can differ substantially across various window widths (Hindriks et al.,  ; Shakil et al.,  ). A second problem is that simulations suggest that sliding window methods can introduce artifactual connectivity variation even under conditions when such variation is known to be absent (Laumann et al.,  ; Lindquist, Xu, Nebel, & Caffo,  ). Third, perhaps due to one or more of the preceding issues, the sliding window method has been found to have poor test–retest reliability (Choe et al.,  ). Fourth, the overlapping nature of the sliding windows precludes definitive segmentation of the fMRI time series into states, making interpretation of the state dynamics difficult. Finally, the sliding window approach requires constructing a sizable number of overlapping windowed connectivity matrices: with 400 timepoints and a 30 second window, 370 distinct connectivity matrices are required (at a step = 1 TR = 1 s). This poses serious scalability issues for relatively long or more temporally granular fMRI datasets. \n\nSome alternatives to sliding window approaches have been proposed in recent years; however, these too have certain drawbacks and limitations. The dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model is a multivariate volatility model that estimates the changing covariance structure at each timepoint in the fMRI time series (Choe et al.,  ; Lindquist et al.,  ). While the DCC model allows for a parametric approach to estimating framewise FC with robust statistical inference, it increases the number of connectivity matrices to consider in the final clustering step compared to the sliding window method, further hindering its scalability. Furthermore, the formulation of the DCC model has been shown to give biased results in high dimensional data (Hafner & Reznikova,  ), which poses an issue for application in fMRI data with a large number of ROIs and time points. Two other recently proposed moment‐to‐moment methods, multiplication of temporal derivatives (Shine et al.,  ) and edge co‐fluctuations (Esfahlani et al.,  ), have similar formulations and are both aimed at uncovering the degree of functional coupling for all ROI pairs at each timepoint. Similarly to DCC, these methods result in a higher dimensional output than that of the sliding window, and the instantaneous estimates of connectivity at each timepoint are highly susceptible to noise. Hidden Markov models (HMMs), which seek to decompose a time series into a sequence of discrete “hidden” states, are another increasingly popular approach for estimating connectivity dynamics (Baker et al.,  ; Quinn et al.,  ; Vidaurre, Smith, & Woolrich,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). However, HMMs rely on several strong assumptions including a predefined number of   k   hidden states that transition between one another in a Markovian fashion (state transitions depend solely on the state at the previous time point). Moreover, HMMs trained at the group level assume a single governing state‐to‐state transition structure across all subjects, which may be too strict and miss important individual variability. \n\nOur focus here is on a hybrid approach that bridges windowed and instantaneous methods by leveraging moment‐to‐moment changes in activation to inform tailored time series segmentation at candidate FC state change points, which reduces both the dimensionality and noisiness that affects many other moment‐to‐moment dFC methods. It is well known from the task‐based fMRI literature that task‐driven changes in activation patterns co‐occur with changes in connectivity patterns (Davison et al.,  ; Gonzalez‐Castillo et al.,  ; Shine & Poldrack,  ; Spielberg, Miller, Heller, & Banich,  ; Sripada et al.,  ; Telesford et al.,  ). This coupling of activation and connectivity changes suggests the possibility that changes in the   activation structure   of the fMRI time series, which are easily derived, can serve as a reasonably reliable marker for changes in the   connectivity structure  , which are more difficult to obtain in an unbiased way. Though connectivity changes may not always be accompanied by activation changes, as long as there is significant correspondence, we can leverage the latter (straightforwardly identified) to find the former (less so) without the need for sliding windows. \n\nIn this work we leverage the coupling between activation and connectivity to present the activation‐informed segmentation approach, a data‐driven dFC framework centered around informed segmentation of fMRI time series at candidate FC state change points. Moment‐to‐moment changes in functional activations have previously been utilized in the literature to investigate dynamic functional connectivity (Shine et al.,  ), but have yet to be used to localize connectivity state changepoints for dynamic time series segmentation. Our approach detects significant instantaneous changes in functional activation patterns and generates data‐driven segments of stable connectivity throughout the fMRI time series. For clarity, we will use the term “segments” when referring to our method and “windows” when referring to the sliding window approach. Separating the time series into discrete time segments rather than a set of highly overlapped sliding windows significantly improves the computational efficiency of dFC analysis and enhances interpretability of results by enabling precise identification of state transition junctures—something the sliding window method cannot provide. We suggest that these FC‐tailored segments provide a useful alternative to standard sliding windows in dFC analyses and show that our approach significantly outperforms the sliding window paradigm in recovering known FC state transitions in a block‐design task. Furthermore, we propose a framework for the comparison of connectomes derived from segments of variable length, as well as a graph embedding step for summarizing connectomes into low‐dimensional representations that we show are better suited for downstream clustering and machine learning tasks than current approaches. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Data description \n  \n####  HCP   data \n  \nIn this work, we utilize the Human Connectome Project (HCP) S1200 Young Adult dataset made publicly available through the Washington University and the University of Minnesota HCP consortium ( ). It is one of the richest collections of neuroimaging data to date, consisting of structural and functional MRI, behavioral assessments, and genotypes for 1200 healthy subjects ages 22–35. A full description of the acquisition protocol can be found in (Van Essen et al.,  ). In short, all HCP fMRI data were acquired on a modified Siemens Skyra 3 T scanner using multiband gradient‐echo EPI (TR = 720 ms, TE = 33 ms, flip angle = 52°, multiband acceleration factor = 8, 2 mm isotropic voxels, FOV = 208 × 180 mm, 72 slices, alternating RL/LR phase encode direction). Participants completed four total resting state fMRI scanning sessions (two sessions collected on each of two different days). Each resultant resting state fMRI time series consisted of 1200 volumes sampled every 0.72 s, for a total acquisition time of 14 min and 24 s. During the resting state sessions participants were instructed to keep their eyes open and fixated on a cross hair on the screen, while remaining as still as possible. For clarity, we will refer to resting state data from the first collection day as sessions 1A (RL) and 1B (LR), and similarly sessions 2A and 2B for those collected on the second day. \n\nThough our main objective is to assess FC dynamics during rest, we also leverage the repeating task/rest block structure of the working memory (WM) task data available in HCP as a natural ground truth to test the performance of our method in identifying the known transitions between the task and rest conditions. The HCP WM task consists of four repeating task/rest blocks, where each block is structured as follows: 27.5 s Task 1 (0‐back), 27.5 s Task 2 (2‐back), 15 s rest. Using the same acquisition details outlined above, each WM task fMRI time series consisted of 405 volumes sampled every 0.72 s, for a total acquisition time of 4 min and 52 s. Two sessions of WM task fMRI were acquired back‐to‐back, alternating between RL and LR phase encoding directions. We will refer to these as WM session 1 (RL) and WM session 2 (LR). \n\n\n#### Data preprocessing \n  \nProcessed volumetric data from the HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline including ICA‐FIX denoising were used. Full details of these steps can be found in (Glasser et al.,  ; Salimi‐Khorshidi et al.,  ). Briefly, BOLD fMRI data were gradient‐nonlinearity distortion corrected, rigidly realigned to adjust for motion, fieldmap corrected, aligned to the structural images, and then registered to MNI space with the nonlinear warping calculated from the structural images. Then FIX was applied on the data to identify and remove motion and other artifacts in the timeseries. These files were used as a baseline for further processing and analysis (e.g., MNINonLinear/Results/rfMRI_REST1_RL/rfMRI_REST1_RL_hp2000_clean.nii.gz from released HCP data). \n\nImages were smoothed with a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, and then resampled to 3 mm isotropic resolution. This step as well as the use of the volumetric data, rather than the surface data, were done to allow comparability with other large datasets in ongoing and planned analyses that are not amenable to surface‐based processing. The smoothed images then went through a number of resting state processing steps, including motion artifact removal steps comparable to the type B (i.e., recommended) stream of (Siegel et al.,  ). Further details on motion artifact removal can be found in (Sripada et al.,  ). Lastly, we calculated spatially averaged time series for each of the 268 ROIs from the parcellation given in (Finn et al.,  ). \n\nFor our analysis, we first considered the set of 966 subjects listed in (Sripada et al.,  ) that met the following criteria: structural T1 and T2 data, four complete resting state fMRI sessions, and < 10% of resting state frames censored due to excessive motion (framewise displacement of 0.5 mm). From this set 922 subjects also had two complete WM task fMRI sessions, defining our final subset of subjects. \n\n\n\n### The   activation‐informed   segmentation framework \n  \nHere, we propose a novel framework for identifying dynamic changes in functional connectivity in fMRI time series, termed the activation‐informed segmentation method. This method leverages the coupling between changes in connectivity structure and changes in whole‐brain activation patterns to produce an intuitive, interpretable, and computationally efficient alternative to the sliding window approach. Our framework consists of three main steps: tailored segmentation of all fMRI time series, summarization of the functional connectivity within each discovered segment, and finally segregation and characterization of a final set of connectivity states (Figure  ). These steps are detailed in Sections  ,   below. \n  \nDepiction of our activation‐informed segmentation pipeline. Briefly, peaks in the GTD series define the boundaries of our tailored, nonoverlapping stable‐FC segments   to   (note   S   can vary between subjects) for all subjects 1 to N. Next, functional connectivity is summarized using structural graph embeddings for each segment in the set of all segments  . Finally,   k  ‐means is applied to segregate all segments into a set of   k   connectivity states \n  \n#### Activation‐informed time series segmentation \n  \nThe dynamic FC paradigm suggests the presence of significant instantaneous changes in connectivity structure at transition points between two distinct functional states. Using this logic, we sought to identify potential connectivity state transition points within fMRI data and utilize them to perform informed segmentation of the time series as a means for assessing FC dynamics. Based on the phenomenon established in task‐based literature (Davison et al.,  ; Gonzalez‐Castillo et al.,  ; Shine & Poldrack,  ; Spielberg et al.,  ; Sripada et al.,  ; Telesford et al.,  ), we hypothesize that changes in the   activation structure   of the fMRI time series, which are easily derived, can serve as a reasonably reliable marker for changes in the   connectivity structure  , which are more difficult to obtain in an unbiased way. To estimate the changes in functional connectivity from one time point   t   to the next, we observe changes in functional activation from one time point to the next by calculating the temporal derivative (  dt  ) of each of   n   ROI activation time series (  A  ) of length   T   using first‐order differencing similar to that in the multiplication of temporal derivatives (MTD) method (Shine et al.,  ): At this point, our method importantly diverges from the MTD method: while the MTD uses these ROI‐wise temporal derivatives to define the connectivity between each pair of ROIs and ultimately generate an   connectome estimate at each time point, our method instead summarizes the regional temporal derivatives to provide a univariate estimate of moment‐to‐moment changes in activation on the whole brain scale. At this point in our pipeline, the resulting   n   temporal derivative series of length   T‐1   are summarized by taking the L ‐norm, that is, the root sum of squares, at each time step   t  , resulting in a single vector of length   T‐1  , which we have termed the Global Temporal Derivative (GTD) series: The GTD provides a univariate summarization of instantaneous changes in global brain activation throughout an fMRI time series, therefore peaks in the GTD series correspond to instances of significant moment‐to‐moment alterations in functional activity. In this way, the GTD is akin to the derivative of the global signal. Growing research suggests the global signal is not noise and carries meaningful information about mental states (Wong, Olafsson, Tal, & Liu,  ). Here, we build on this work to suggest that global signal shifts mark changes in dynamic mental states. We seek to automatedly identify these change points as candidate FC state transitions for the subsequent time series segmentation step. We begin by applying exponentially weighted moving average smoothing (window size = 15 TR,  ) to the GTD series to reduce noisy peaks. We then perform moving average peak detection (window size = 20 TR for Rest, 10 TR for WM task) on the smoothed GTD series, identifying points in the time series that are > = 2.5 standard deviations above the moving average. To avoid identification of multiple points that surpass this threshold but actually correspond to a single true peak, we collapsed points in close proximity to one another to the local maximum (within 10 TR, corresponding to 7 s or the approximate time‐to‐peak of the hemodynamic response function [Friston,  ]). Furthermore, as these change points define our tailored segments for downstream calculation of functional connectivity, we set a minimum inter‐peak distance of 25 TR to ensure sufficiently large segments for calculating Pearson correlation (Schönbrodt & Perugini,  ; Thirion et al.,  ; Turner, Paul, Miller, & Barbey,  ) (note: we reduce this to 15 TR for the case of WM task data to accommodate the shorter resting state segments we intend to capture). This final set of change points define the boundaries of the tailored time segments, within which we compute FC and between which we investigate potential dynamic FC shifts. \n\n\n#### Functional connectivity estimation \n  \nFor each tailored segment   s  , we compute the functional connectivity matrix  , where the   i,j   entry is the Pearson correlation of the activation time series of ROIs   i   and   j   within the time segment,   and  : We then apply the Fisher transformation followed by z‐scoring on each FC matrix  , to allow for better comparisons between connectivity matrices of segments of differing lengths. Connectivity matrices derived from shorter segments have, on average, higher correlation values than those from longer segments, resulting in a skewed sample distribution. Applying the Fisher transformation enforces an approximately normal distribution of the connectivity values within each segment (Fisher,  ), and the z‐score then translates these connectivity values in terms of their standard deviations from the mean. While these connectome transformations are common practice in the field of FC, they are especially important when attempting to compare connectomes from segments of variable lengths, which is illustrated in Figure  . \n  \nEffects of (a) no transformation, (b) z‐score transformation, (c) Fisher transformation, and (d) z‐scored (Fisher) transformation on the distribution of Pearson correlation‐based connectivity values in short (<25 TR) and long (>35 TR) segments \n  \nThresholding is another common pre‐processing step in functional connectivity analysis, as it preserves only the high‐fidelity connections within connectomes and effectively filters out noise. Though the Fisher transformation with z‐scoring helps to align the sample distributions of connectivity values between longer and shorter segments, we still observed the effects of segment length when thresholding on z‐scores alone—connectomes from shorter segments were denser (i.e., had more edges preserved) after thresholding than connectomes from longer segments. This segment‐length discrepancy in connectome density with z‐score thresholding had significant downstream effects in our pipeline, as we found the resultant FC state clusters were highly correlated with segment length. To avoid these segment length effects, we fix the density of all connectomes by thresholding to the top‐  K   connections (or edges) in each connectome. Recent work has suggested that such rank‐based schemes are optimal for reliability and reproducibility in FC analyses (Bridgeford et al.,  ). Here, we set top‐  K   = 10,000, which preserves the strongest (i.e., highest magnitude) 27.95% edges, thereby providing sufficient noise reduction. \n\n\n#### State clustering \n  \nThe final step of our dFC framework involves using   k  ‐means clustering to separate all thresholded connectomes into a discrete set of   k   connectivity states. This state clustering occurs on the aggregated set of   m   connectomes, where   m   is the total number of time segments across all subjects in a single fMRI scanning session (Table  ). In traditional dFC streams, this approach involves performing   k  ‐means clustering on the flattened upper triangular of all   m   connectomes, however we found poor performance with this method, likely due to the high dimensionality of the flattened connectomes (>35,000) (Table  ). We address this issue of high dimensionality by generating low‐dimensional latent representations of each thresholded connectivity matrix that sufficiently summarize the connectivity patterns within the time segment. Specifically, we utilize state‐of‐the‐art graph embedding methods, which are commonly used in the field of data mining to generate low‐dimensional representations of graphs (i.e., networks) (Rossi et al.,  ). Connectomes are graphs by definition, consisting of a set of nodes (ROIs) connected by edges (z‐scored correlations), so graph mining methods naturally extend to the connectome space. To generate our graph embeddings, we first apply GraphWave (Donnat, Zitnik, Hallac, & Leskovec,  ) on the top‐  K  ‐thresholded connectomes to produce a set of   d  ‐dimensional   node embeddings   for each of the   n   ROIs per connectome. GraphWave learns structural node embeddings, which individually capture the structural role of each node (ROI) within its local network neighborhood and in aggregate provide insights into the topological organization of the connectome graph. We then utilize principal components analysis (PCA) to summarize the set of   n d  ‐dimensional   node embeddings  , concatenated into one long node embedding vector of length   n  *  d  , into a single   graph embedding   vector by extracting the top 100 principal components. Aggregating these connectome graph embeddings across all time segments from all subjects results in a feature matrix of size  . \n  \nSymbols and abbreviations \n  \nWe performed   k  ‐means clustering on the resultant group‐level feature matrix, varying the number of clusters   k   in the range of 2–10. To determine the optimal number of clusters we utilized the elbow criterion of the cluster validity index, computed as the ratio of within‐cluster distance to between‐cluster distance (Allen et al.,  ). We mapped corresponding clusters across the session replicates to a single overall state based on shortest Euclidean distances between the cluster centroid connectomes. Reproducibility of FC state clusters was tested across scanning sessions (two sessions for WM task, four sessions for resting state). Test–retest reliability was calculated across scanning sessions between centroid connectomes of corresponding states using the image intra‐class correlation (I2C2) (Shou et al.,  ). I2C2 is the generalization of the intra‐class correlation (ICC) coefficient to high‐dimensional multivariate data, such as images (or in our case, connectomes). As a brief description, let   X  (  c  ) be the true, unknown connectome for state   i   and   W  (  c  ) be the estimated connectome for state   i   during session   j   at connectome edge   c  . The classical measurement error model for the connectome images across replication studies can then be written as \n\nwhere connectomes are represented as   vectors;   W   = {  W  (  c  ):   c   = 1, …,   C  } are the observed connectomes;   X   = {  X  (  c  ):   c   = 1, …,   C  } are the true connectomes, and   U   = {  U  (  c  ):   c   = 1, …,   C  } are the measurement error of the connectomes. In this framework,   i   = 1, …,   I  , where   I   = total states = 5, and   j   = 1, …,   J  , where   J   = total sessions = 4. Connected to the classical measurement error model above and analogous to the standard ICC formulation, the I2C2 is defined as: where   K   = cov(   U   ,    U   ),   K   = cov(   X   ,    X   ), and   K   = cov(   W   ,    W   ), and both   K   and   K   cannot be estimated directly since   U   and   X   are unobserved. Therefore, the I2C2 is computed using the following method of moments estimators: where   is the average connectome for state   i   over all sessions   j  , and   is the average connectome across all states and sessions. Utilizing these estimators, I2C2 metrics were computed in R using the package provided by the authors in Neuroconductor ( ). We further characterize the resultant connectivity states with standard dFC features including average dwell time and state‐to‐state transition probabilities, and go on to correlate these dFC features with neurophenotypes of interest. \n\n\n\n### Evaluation against ground truth \n  \nAs described in Section  , the WM task consists of four repeating task/rest blocks, where each block is structured as follows: 27.5 s Task 1 (0‐back), 27.5 s Task 2 (2‐back), 15 s rest. This repeating task/rest block structure of the WM Task data serves as a natural ground truth for validation of our framework: if activation changes can truly be used as markers for connectivity changes, then we should be able to show that the discovered activation‐informed change points align well with true onsets of WM task conditions. In fMRI data, signals are expected to be observed shortly after the stimulus, rather than directly aligned to the stimulus onset, due to lag in the hemodynamic response. Furthermore, the nature of block‐design tasks results in sustained task‐related activation changes rather than instantaneous spikes and subjects may require an additional 1–2 s after the condition onset to fully enter the task state and experience the full effects of the task‐induced activation response. Based on this, we defined a state change response window of 12 TR (8.6 s) to account for the hemodynamic response time of 10 TR (7.2 s) as well as an additional buffer of 2 TR (1.4 s) for subjects to fully enter the task condition state. All peaks identified in the GTD series were labeled as either true positives or false positives based on whether they fell within the state change response window following a known task condition transition or not. Based on these labels, we calculate the overall precision and recall of our activation‐informed change point detection, as well as the recall for transitions into each of the three task conditions (Task 1, Task 2, and Rest). \n\n\n### Comparison to sliding window \n  \nWhile the sliding window framework has been widely used to estimate dynamic FC states in resting fMRI where ground truth state changes cannot be known, it has not, to the best of our knowledge, been validated against a block‐design task structure where the ground truth state changes are in fact known. To enable a direct comparison with the performance of our activation‐informed segmentation method we applied the sliding window framework to the WM task data using the Group ICA of fMRI toolbox (GIFT) ( ; Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science, Atlanta, Georgia) implementation, following the parameterization detailed in (Allen et al.,  ) as closely as possible. Specifically, we first performed group‐level spatial independent component analysis (gICA) (Calhoun, Adali, Pearlson, & Pekar,  ) to extract 50 independent components (ICs). IC time series then underwent a standard postprocessing procedure to remove low‐frequency trends associated with scanner drift, motion related variance and any other nonspecific “spikes” or possible noise artifacts. Next, we utilized the dFNC function in the GIFT toolbox to perform the sliding window analysis. As in (Allen et al.,  ), we use a tapered window created by convolving a rectangle (window size = 44 s/61 TR) with a Gaussian (σ = 3 TR) and sliding in steps of 1 TR, resulting in 344 total windows per WM fMRI session, and a total of 317,168 windows across all 922 subjects for each WM Sessions 1 and 2. Finally, the upper triangular of the windowed connectomes were used as feature vectors of length  , and   k  ‐means clustering was applied to separate all windows into a set of   k   states. We utilized the “estimate_clusters” option in the GIFT toolbox to identify the optimal value of   k   from the range of 2–10. Further details regarding the implementation of the GIFT toolbox steps can be found in the software manual ( ). To evaluate the accuracy of the resultant sliding window state clustering and compare against that of our proposed method, we implemented the common design choice of setting the ground truth label (i.e., “task” or “rest”) for each window as the label assigned to the time point at the center of the window, in this case timepoint 31. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### The   GTD   method accurately identified known transitions during a working memory task \n  \nResults of GTD‐based peak discovery in WM task data are shown in Figure  . The distribution of the discovered GTD peaks across all subjects showed a concentration of peaks immediately after a new condition onset (Figure  ). In fMRI data, signals are expected to be observed shortly after the stimulus, rather than directly aligned to the stimulus onset, due to lag in the hemodynamic response. Using the true positive and false positive labels detailed earlier in Section  , we found an average precision of 0.72 and average recall of 0.66 of all discovered change points against ground truth state transitions (Table  ). We found that Task 1 and Rest state onsets were more readily identifiable by our method than Task 2 onsets (Recall 0.67, 0.75, and 0.57, respectively), indicating that transitions from task state to rest state and vice‐versa elicit more significant changes in moment‐to‐moment activations than transitions from an easier 0‐back WM task (Task 1) to a more difficult 2‐back WM task (Task 2). \n  \nResults of the activation‐informed segmentation for all subjects in structured WM task data.

(B) Histogram of discovered GTD peak locations show strong alignment to known condition onsets \n    \nPerformance of the activation‐informed segmentation method and the standard sliding window method in recovering ground truth dynamic state changes in WM task data \n    \nWe found the optimal number of clusters   k   = 3 for both WM Session 1 and WM Session 2. Figure   illustrates the alignment of our segments, colored by their respective clusters, to the ground truth WM task conditions. Overall, we found good segregation between task and rest conditions, with improved accuracy in later block repetitions. As observed with the change point detection, the separation between Tasks 1 and 2 conditions is more difficult, owing both to the similarity in connectivity between the two working memory task conditions and to the lack of change point detection at Task 2 onset points resulting in segments that span the time frame of both Tasks 1 and 2. Homogeneity and normalized mutual information (NMI) metrics of our discovered clusters compared to the known ground truth are reported in Table  . As our temporal segments may not directly align to the ground truth task blocks we derived ground truth labels for each discovered segment based on the corresponding task condition throughout the majority of the segment. \n\n\n### In the working memory task, activation‐informed segmentation performance was superior to sliding window \n  \nWe report the results of the GIFT toolbox sliding window pipeline for   k   = 5 states, which was estimated as the optimal   k   using the automated cluster estimation available in the GIFT toolbox (Table  ). Though the sliding window approach does capture some repeating task versus rest signal (Figure  ), we found the GIFT sliding window approach had significantly decreased performance in segregating between known task and rest condition windows compared to our activation‐informed segmentation approach (homogeneity = 0.037 vs. 0.280, respectively). Based on these results, we can conclude that our method more effectively and efficiently summarized the FC in each time segment, resulting in a 99.8% reduction in size of the final feature set passed to   k  ‐means compared to that of the sliding window approach (  vs.   in WM Session 1). Furthermore, our method proved to be much more computationally efficient than the sliding window approach, completing in <2 hours for all subjects in a single WM session while the GIFT toolbox required >24 hours to complete the requisite ICA and dFNC steps for the same data. Considering together the accuracy, data reduction and the runtime, we found our activation‐informed segmentation method to outperform the traditional sliding window paradigm in recovering dynamics in the context of a block‐design ground truth. \n  \nResults of GIFT toolbox‐based sliding window framework for all subjects in structured WM task data. Task condition onsets marked by vertical lines: dashed for Task 1 onset, dotted for Task 2 onset, solid for Rest onset \n  \n\n### The activation‐informed segmentation method identified five connectivity states during rest \n  \nWe applied our activation‐informed segmentation pipeline separately on four sessions of resting state fMRI data. Using the elbow criterion of the cluster validity index, we consistently found the optimal number of clusters   k   = 5 across the four sessions (Figure  ). Though our state clusters were derived using the graph embedding vectors as described above, we characterized the connectivity of each discovered cluster using the more interpretable top‐  K   thresholded connectomes derived upstream in our pipeline for all segments in each cluster. We mapped corresponding clusters across the four session replicates to a single overall “dynamic state” based on shortest Euclidean distances between the cluster centroid connectomes and found that each centroid was mapped only to one overall state by this criterion, indicating each state did indeed exhibit a unique connectivity signature. \n  \nTemporal alignment of activation‐informed segments and their corresponding state labels given by   k  ‐means in all four resting state fMRI sessions \n  \n\n### Connectivity states during rest exhibit excellent   Test–Retest   reliability \n  \nTo assess the stability of these clusters we use the I2C2 metric, which was developed to assess the reliability of MRI images for a set of subjects across several image acquisition sessions. The I2C2 metric is a high‐dimensional multivariate generalization of the intra‐class correlation coefficient for use on images and other multi‐dimensional data, such as connectomes (Shou et al.,  ). A brief description of I2C2 and its application in our case can be found in Section   above. We found very high replicability of our states across the four sessions (I2C2 = 0.96), suggesting that the dynamic states recovered by our method are indeed persistent across subjects and time, and may also be cognitively meaningful. \n\n\n### Activation peaks observed during rest closely resemble peaks found when transitioning in and out of cognitively demanding task states \n  \nWe found that the magnitude of the GTD peaks that correspond to our discovered FC change points and define our dynamic states in rest are on the same order and mirror the distribution of the peaks found in the WM task setting (Kullback–Leibler divergence = 0.030; Figure  ). This indicates that the changes in functional brain activity between dynamic states in rest are as strong as those observed when transitioning in and out of a cognitively demanding task state. \n  \nHistograms of GTD magnitudes at discovered peaks for 9700 change points in WM Session 1 and a size‐matched random sample of change points in Rest Session 1A show similar distributions (Kullback–Leibler divergence = 0.030) \n  \n\n### Connectivity states involve   brain‐wide   connectivity patterns and prominently involve prefrontal/  sensory‐motor   coupling \n  \nWe further characterized the overall connectivity signature of each resultant dynamic state by averaging the corresponding cluster centroids across the four sessions. This signature connectome for each of the five overall dynamic states is presented in Figure  . Overall, we observed states that reflect shifting connectivity across network modules, rather than within network modules, consistent with prior work (Betzel, Fukushima, He, Zuo, & Sporns,  ; Zalesky, Fornito, Cocchi, Gollo, & Breakspear,  ). In particular, we observed changing patterns of brain integration and segregation, prominently involving the frontoparietal network and the default mode network (Zalesky et al.,  ). States 1, 3, and 5 all involve sensory/motor anti‐correlation with the frontoparietal network and default mode network. State 1 encompassed all sensory and motor networks, while State 3 had greater visual network specificity and State 5 had greater motor specificity. State 2 was characterized by anticorrelation between frontoparietal and medial frontal network, without sensory/motor involvement. State 4 exhibited none of the above motifs—just the within network connectivity that was common to all of the states. Importantly, the five states we observed are highly similar to the states identified in this same HCP dataset using the classic sliding window paradigm as reported in Nomi et al., ( ). \n  \nConnectivity signatures for each of our five discovered resting FC states. Connectivity signatures are defined by the centroid (i.e., average) of all connectomes belonging to each state cluster. Glass brain views show the top 0.5% of connections (360 edges) for each state \n  \n\n### Resting connectivity states exhibit complex patterns of transitioning \n  \nIn addition to summarizing each dynamic state by its unique connectivity patterns, we also extracted common dFC features including state‐to‐state transition probabilities, average dwell times per state, and number of occurrences of each state across the four resting sessions. We extracted these dFC features on a per‐subject basis and then averaged them to capture the general patterns for all five dynamic states at the group level. The average state‐to‐state transition matrix, average dwell times, and average number of occurrences per state across all subjects are depicted in Figure  . Overall, we found the highest probabilities of transitioning into State 4 from any of the other states. Interestingly, State 4 also exhibits the shortest dwell time of all five states, averaging a duration of   s, as well as the highest average number of occurrences. This coupled with the lower overall connectivity observed in State 4 suggests that this may represent a “buffer” state between the other dynamic states. \n  \nAverage transition probabilities of moving from State X (along rows) to State Y (along columns) (a), dwell times (b), and number of occurrences (c) across all subjects and resting state fMRI sessions \n  \n\n### Resting connectivity states are correlated with behavioral phenotypes including cognition, personality, and psychopathology \n  \nWe performed a regression analysis to assess the combined relationship between subject‐specific dFC feature vectors, averaged across the four resting state sessions, and several neuro‐relevant phenotypes. Specifically, we consider 10 cognitive metrics: a general factor of intelligence (G; generated from a bifactor model as described in [Sripada, Angstadt, Rutherford, Taxali, & Shedden,  ]), processing speed (generated from factor modeling of three NIH Toolbox tasks as described in (Sripada et al.,  )), the five facets of personality given by the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism), and the three dimensions of psychopathology given by the Adult Self Report Scale (Internalizing, Attention Problems, Externalizing). We also included the covariates of age and gender. All features (besides the binary gender marker) were z‐scored prior to the regression analysis, so the resultant model 𝛽 values could be interpreted similarly to correlation values. At a Bonferroni‐corrected   significance threshold, we found significant relationships between our dFC features and four phenotypes (G, externalizing behavior, agreeableness and conscientiousness). Significant regression results are reported in Table  . \n  \nOrdinary least squares regression results for significantly predicted phenotypes (Bonferroni‐corrected  ) \n  \n\n### Resting connectivity states are unrelated to head motion \n  \nHead motion is a serious confound in studies of functional connectivity (Power, Barnes, Snyder, Schlaggar, & Petersen,  ; Power, Schlaggar, & Petersen,  ; Satterthwaite et al.,  ; van Dijk, Sabuncu, & Buckner,  ). Moreover, it has recently been argued that head motion may in fact generate the time varying connectivity observed with sliding window methods (Laumann et al.,  ). We thus sought to determine whether the connectivity states we detected at rest with the GTD method were related to head motion. We found no significant correlation between the mean framewise displacement time series and the GTD series in all four resting state sessions (  r   = −0.0027; 95% CI = [−0.006, 0.0007]). We report all time‐lagged cross‐correlations for   TR in each of the four resting state sessions in Table S . This lack of correlation between framewise displacement and the GTD series suggests that there is no significant contribution of head motion to our discovered change points, and thereby our final dynamic states in rest. Taken together, these results strongly support the general existence of dynamicity in resting state and the reliability of the states discovered by our activation‐informed framework. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this study, we introduce a new data‐driven approach for assessing dynamic functional connectivity through informed time series segmentation. Our method, termed the activation‐informed segmentation method, aims to derive FC states without the limitations of a predefined time scale for the dynamics or highly overlapped sliding windows. This framework is built upon the theory that changes in functional connectivity are mirrored by changes in functional activation. We validated our activation‐informed segmentation method in a working memory task setting where ground truth transitions between cognitive states are known. In this validation experiment we found that our method accurately marked known task boundaries, correctly recovered three connectivity states, and displayed a precision and recall profile that compared favorably to a leading sliding window approach. When applying the method to resting state data, we detected five connectivity states that displayed excellent test–retest reliability across four sessions of resting fMRI, exhibited complex transition dynamics, were correlated with multiple behavioral phenotypes, and were essentially unrelated to head motion. Our work expands the methodological toolkit for quantifying and characterizing time‐varying connectivity and provides new evidence for the existence of distinct dynamic states during rest. \n\nWe assessed the activation‐informed segmentation method and sliding window approach head‐to‐head on a block‐design working memory task to test whether these methods detect connectivity state changes where ground truth is known. Laumann et al. performed a test of the opposite issue: They examined a task with extended blocks where connectivity is assumed to be stable and found sliding window methods inappropriately found changing connectivity states where such changes are assumed to be absent (Laumann et al.,  ). In our test, the activation‐informed segmentation method performed well. We observed an average precision of 0.72, meaning that 72% of activation changes detected by our algorithm corresponded to true changes in functional connectivity. Furthermore, the recall of true state transition points by our method averaged 0.66 and reached as high as 0.77 depending on the strength of the functional connectivity changes, indicating that a majority of known connectivity transitions are indeed marked by changes in global functional activation. In contrast, the GIFT sliding window method precludes the calculation of such precision and recall statistics due to the highly overlapping nature of the resultant windows. When considering the accuracy of the final state clustering, our method indeed performed ~75% better than the sliding window method in separating blocks of true task from true rest. As far as we know, this is the first such test of the sliding window method in task data where ground truth is known. The fact that the sliding window has only fair accuracy in finding changes in connectivity state suggests there is room for improvement and reinforces our claim that further methods innovation in the study of time varying FC would be beneficial. \n\nThe activation‐informed segmentation method found five states at rest and these states showed excellent test–retest reliability. These states appear to be broadly consistent with those reported in the previous literature in terms of number of states as well as connectivity patterns (Nomi et al.,  ). Furthermore, the mean dwell times are similar in duration. We also found these states are linked to a number of behavioral phenotypes – with the magnitudes of relationships similar to those reported in prior studies (Nomi et al.,  ). Taken together, these results suggest that there is some continuity in our results with the results from sliding window approaches. Nonetheless, some key differences remain. First, the states identified here have much higher test–retest reliability. Second, the method to identify them is intuitive, computationally efficient, and appears not to be driven by artifactual causes (e.g., head motion). \n\nA key assumption of our method is that activation changes can serve as a marker of changes in connectivity states. Several lines of evidence support this assumption. First, there is a substantial set of studies (discussed in the Introduction) that document connectivity patterns that arise during distinct task conditions. Importantly, these task conditions are antecedently known to produce distinct distributed activation profiles so that transitions into the relevant task conditions would produce activation shifts. Second, in the present study, we observed GTD peaks during the N‐back working memory task when subjects shift task conditions, and we observed distinct connectivity states in the segments flanked by these GTD peaks. Third, if our main assumption were false, that is, if activation shifts   fail to   mark changes in connectivity states, then we should not have found large activation shifts during rest that are associated with distinct, highly test–retest reliable connectivity states. The fact that we did observe these results from rest provides further support that there is in fact a link between activation shifts and connectivity state changes. Finally, as we noted in the previous paragraph, the states identified have similarities along multiple dimensions with states identified through traditional sliding window methods. If our activation‐informed segmentation approach can find connectivity states that are broadly similar to those found by sliding window approaches, this can only be explained if activation changes do indeed serve as a marker of connectivity changes. \n\nIn a somewhat unexpected finding, we observed GTD peaks during rest (corresponding to state change points) that were similar in magnitude to those seen during a working memory task. This finding is notable because the N‐back working memory task is highly cognitively demanding and produces vigorous activations across a distributed “task‐positive network” (Cabeza & Nyberg,  ; Cole & Schneider,  ; Mazoyer et al.,  ; Niendam et al.,  ). Rest, in contrast, is assumed to be a state of substantially reduced cognitive demands (Andrews‐Hanna, Reidler, Huang, & Buckner,  ; Buckner, Andrews‐Hanna, & Schacter,  ; McKiernan, Kaufman, Kucera‐Thompson, & Binder,  ). It is thus remarkable that we observed GTD peaks during the resting state on par with those that occur in response to transitions in and out of a cognitively demanding task. The fact that resting GTD peaks are so large provides additional support for our framework, which is based on the idea that easy‐to‐detect GTD peaks can be leveraged to identify hard‐to‐detect changes in connectivity states—large GTD peaks are particularly easy to detect. But critically, large GTD peaks during rest should be of independent interest to the field. That is, irrespective of their link to changes in connectivity states (which has been our focus in this study), the fact that there are regular and robust GTD peaks during rest is itself a phenomenon that needs follow up investigation and explanation. \n\nThere has been some skepticism in the field about the reality of time varying connectivity. A sizable portion of this debate centers on the sliding window methodology for demonstrating varying connectivity states (Laumann et al.,  ; Lindquist et al.,  ). It is claimed that this method generates artifacts, finds changes where none exist, etc. An important advance of the present study is that it demonstrates time‐varying FC during rest without reliance on sliding window methods. Moreover, the associated connectivity states exhibit excellent test–retest reliability. Therefore, we believe that the present study offers some of the strongest evidence to date for the reality of time‐varying connectivity at rest. More specifically, we suggest that the state transition points identified by our framework actually represent a lower bound of the “true” dynamic state changes in rest. This is because there is likely only an imperfect relationship between activation shifts and connectivity state changes: the former may be sufficient but not necessary for the latter. Thus, there may be at least some connectivity state changes that are not anteceded by prominent (and thus easy‐to‐detect) GTD peaks, and our method will fail to detect the presence of such connectivity states. One such example is the transition between Tasks 1 and 2 conditions in the WM task experiment, in which we observed lower recall for the GTD peak detection at these points, indicating these particular connectivity state changes are more subtle and nuanced than transitions from rest to task states and do not result in strong whole brain activation changes. Future work should seek to extend the change point detection scheme developed here to enable identification of these “connectivity‐only” transitions. Such a method could be formulated as an extension of existing instantaneous connectivity estimation methodologies (i.e., MTD, ECF, DCC), aimed at identifying significant moment‐to‐moment changes in multivariate connectivity rather than univariate activation. It is also possible these requirements can be fulfilled through the use of deep learning approaches, specifically recurrent neural network architectures, which are designed to learn complex, nonlinear patterns in multivariate time series data (Li & Fan,  ). \n\nThis study has several limitations. First, we rely on a key assumption that activation shifts, more specifically those activation shifts that are strong enough to be observed at the whole‐brain scale, can serve as a marker for changes in connectivity states. We acknowledge that the relationship is likely imperfect, and our method may underestimate the true number of states. The strength of our method, nonetheless, is simplicity and transparency, enabling the method to yield notably strong evidence for dynamic states at rest. Second, our peak detection scheme is reliant on several empirically tuned parameters as well as an exponentially weighted moving average operation that may be subject to similar criticism as the sliding window Pearson correlation approach. However, it is important to note that the identification of local maxima in a univariate signal (i.e., GTD) is not as sensitive to window size as computation of multivariate cross‐correlations—the strongest peaks will survive across a variety of moving average window lengths. Additionally, we note that there are methods available for peak detection that do not rely on moving averages that can be substituted into our pipeline, and future work can explore these approaches. Third, unlike sliding window methods that impose a uniform length on windowed connectivity matrices, the activation‐informed segmentation method is sensitive to the duration of states. We mitigated this in multiple ways, including Fisher transformation and z‐scoring of Pearson correlation‐based connectivity matrices, as well as employing a top‐  K   thresholding to control connectome density across both short and long segment lengths. Fourth, the meaning and importance of the dynamic states uncovered by the GTD method is unclear. We showed activation shifts are large (comparable to transitions in and out of a working memory task). We also presented initial data that connectivity states are linked to phenotypes of interest. But additional work is needed to establish what psychological processes are reflected in these dynamic states, and whether quantifying these transient states will yield significant theoretical and practical insights in psychology and neuroscience. \n\nIn sum, we introduce here a novel method for identifying dynamic states in fMRI that generates data‐driven segments of stable FC, validate the method in task data where ground truth is known, and demonstrate that the method finds considerable evidence for the presence of dynamic states at rest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"ab667d0a7b3d1bf150954454bf3f9626"},

Moreover, it is unclear whether these alterations can be reversed upon treatment. Here, we used functional MRI to study resting state connectivity in rats following chronic intermittent exposure to ethanol. Further, we evaluated the effects of SB‐277011‐a, a selective dopamine D3 receptor antagonist, known to decrease ethanol consumption. Alcohol‐dependent and control rats (  N   = 13/14 per group), 3 weeks into abstinence, were administered SB‐277011‐a or vehicle before fMRI sessions. Resting state connectivity networks were extracted by independent component analysis. A dual‐regression analysis was performed using independent component maps as spatial regressors, and the effects of alcohol history and treatment on connectivity were assessed. A history of alcohol dependence caused widespread reduction of the internal coherence of components. Weaker correlation was also found between the insula cortex (IC) and cingulate cortices, key constituents of the salience network. Similarly, reduced connectivity was observed between a component comprising the anterior insular cortex, together with the caudate putamen (CPu‐AntIns), and the posterior part of the IC. On the other hand, postdependent rats showed strengthened connectivity between salience and reward networks. In particular, higher connectivity was observed between insula and nucleus accumbens, between the ventral tegmental area and the cingulate cortex and between the VTA and CPu‐AntIns. Interestingly, aberrant connectivity in postdependent rats was partially restored by acute administration of SB‐277011‐a, which, conversely, had no significant effects in naïve rats. \n  \nWe used a rodent model of alcohol dependence to investigate the effect of chronic ethanol exposure on brain functional connectivity and test the hypothesis that alcohol‐induced alterations could be reversed by pharmacotherapy. Results showed widespread activation during early abstinence with a prominent involvement of the insular cortex (eg, salience network). Further, we demonstrate that aberrant connectivity in “abstinence network” can be restored by the administration of SB‐277011a, a D3 selective antagonist with efficacy in attenuating alcohol seeking in the rat, suggesting that fMRI‐derived brain connectivity networks could be a potential biomarker for medication development.\n   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is an important public health issue with largely unmet medical needs. Several therapeutic strategies have been investigated to control alcohol drinking, craving, and relapse in abusers. However, only a minority of the patients benefits from pharmacological treatments, and the relapse rate is still high. For this reason, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying alcohol addiction is of critical importance to identify molecular targets for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. \n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the exploration of large‐scale brain networks in vivo, non‐invasively, and with high spatial resolution. Particularly, resting‐state functional connectivity (rsFC) refers to fMRI data acquired in the absence of an explicit task and is assessed by measuring correlations of spontaneous fluctuations of blood oxygen level‐dependent (BOLD) signals in different regions of the brain at rest. ,   This technique has been widely applied to investigate the effects of various drugs and neuropsychiatric disorders on resting‐state functional networks in both humans and laboratory animals, thus bridging clinical and preclinical research. ,  \n\nA few studies suggest that during abstinence AUD patients show aberrant patterns of resting state connectivity, with some inconsistent results. Indeed, several studies reported increased connectivity within prefrontal and frontobasal networks including default, salience, and executive networks in patients compared with controls. ,   Others found weaker intrinsic connectivity in these networks.  These discrepancies may result from the heterogeneity in patient populations such as duration and severity of AUD, duration of abstinence, comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, concurrent consumption of other drugs of abuse, and effects of pharmacological treatments. All these factors could greatly impact brain functional connectivity and may bias inference regarding the effects of alcohol exposure. \n\nAnimal models of AUD can overcome some of these limitations as they allow in vivo manipulation of experimental factors within a well‐controlled environment in a longitudinal perspective. Two essential conditions are required to develop AUD in humans—sufficiently high alcohol levels and exposure over long periods of time. To capture such conditions in rodents that do not voluntarily intoxicate themselves over prolonged periods of time, controlled forced administration paradigms are used. Chronic intermittent exposure (CIE) to daily cycles of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal over weeks or months mimics a pattern of alcohol use typically seen in clinical populations. Similar to AUD patients, animals show behavioral and neuroadaptive consequences that are induced as a subject becomes dependent on alcohol and remain for extended periods of time even in the absence of alcohol exposure—a condition referred to as a “postdependent state” (PD) and conceptualized as a model for the increased propensity to relapse in abstinent alcoholic patients. ,   While this condition may not be considered as an addiction per se, PD rats show “addiction‐prone” behavioral responses related to the motivational,  emotional,  and inhibitory control circuits  comprising the tripartite addiction circuitry. Hence, the CIE procedure has become the dominant paradigm in preclinical AUD research and medication development of the last 15 years. ,  \n\nHere, we took advantage of the PD rat model to investigate whether a history of alcohol dependence has long‐term effects on functional connectivity networks in the rat brain. To our knowledge, only one study investigated the effects of alcohol on brain connectivity in rodents via resting‐state fMRI, focusing on the effects of binge‐like adolescent alcohol exposure.  In that study, several regions of interest were defined anatomically with the aim of elucidating frontostriatal alterations due to alcohol exposure. However the analysis did not take into account areas such as the insular cortex (IC), which has been shown to be involved in alcoholism. ,   The insula is central to the salience network, a key circuit involved in detection and processing of externally and internally generated salient stimuli. ,   To overcome the need of a priori defined regions of interest, in the current work, we used a data‐driven approach (decomposition by independent component analysis) to parcellate the brain into functional components. In addition, we aimed to test whether alcohol‐induced alterations in functional connectivity may be reversed by pharmacological treatment. A powerful tool to specifically interfere with distinct network nodes within the reward system is provided by the D3 antagonist SB‐277011‐a, because its target dopamine D3 receptors are highly selectively expressed in the ventral striatum. ,   Importantly, SB‐277011‐a has been previously shown to reduce seeking and taking of alcohol and other drugs of abuse in the rat. ,  ,  ,   Hence, we here studied the ability of SB‐277011‐a to modulate the reward system and subsequent effects on overall network function in PD and nondependent (ND) rats. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Animals \n  \nMale Wistar rats, initial weight 220 to 250 g, were used (Charles River), housed two to four per cage (Type‐IV; Ehret) under a 12 hours light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the local animal care committee (Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, Germany, license numbers: 35‐9185.81/G‐10/16 and Italian Ministry of Health, approval number: 796/2016‐PR). \n\n\n### Ethanol exposure \n  \nTo induce dependence, rats were exposed to daily intermittent exposure cycles to alcohol vapour intoxication and withdrawal, a paradigm that allows a high degree of control over brain alcohol levels and induces behavioral and molecular changes relevant for the pathophysiology of alcoholism. ,   Rats were weight‐matched, assigned into the two experimental groups, and exposed to either ethanol vapour (  N   = 13, becoming PD) or normal air (  N   = 14, ND) using a rodent alcohol inhalation system as described previously.  Briefly, dosing pumps (Knauer) deliver alcohol into electrically heated stainless‐steel coils (60°C) connected to an airflow of 18 L/min into glass and steel chambers (1 × 1 × 1 m). For the next 8 weeks, rats were exposed to five cycles of 14 hours of ethanol vapour per week (0:00 AM to 2:00 PM) separated by daily 10‐hour periods of withdrawal. Twice per week, blood (∼20 μL) was sampled from the lateral tail vein, and blood alcohol concentrations were determined using an AM1 Analox system (Analox Instruments). Blood alcohol level was monitored throughout the ethanol vapour exposure and the concentration maintained around 250 mg/dL (see SI, Figure  ). After the last exposure cycle, rats remained abstinent for 3 weeks before initiating the MRI scan. \n\n\n### Drugs \n  \nSB‐277011‐a dihydrochloride (Tocris Bioscience) was dissolved in 20% w/v 2‐hydroxypropyl‐beta‐cyclodextrin in water and administered according to a within‐subject design, in a counterbalanced order, intraperitoneally, at a dose of 20 mg/kg/mL, ,   30 minutes before the beginning of the scan session.  Seven days of recovery were allowed between the two imaging sessions (see SI,  ). \n\n\n### Animal preparation for fMRI \n  \nFor the rs‐fMRI experiment, animals were initially anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in O :N O (3:7), which was then reduced to 1.5% for maintenance during preparation.  Subsequently, a bolus of 0.05 mg/kg/mL of medetomidine (Domitor, 1 mg/mL, Orion Pharma) was injected intraperitoneally, followed, 15 minutes later, by a continuous infusion of medetomidine diluted 1:5 in saline at a rate of 1 mL/kg/h through a catheter inserted subcutaneously. ,  \n\nAfter that, rats were injected with vehicle or SB‐277011‐a and then placed in the scanner. At this point, isoflurane was discontinued. \n\nScout images, shimming procedures, and structural scan were conducted in this time frame, while the functional imaging session started 30 minutes after the administration of the drug and at least 15 minutes after removal of isoflurane. \n\nDuring the scan, respiration rate, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation were monitored with a pulsoximeter (STARR Life Science, USA). CO  concentration in the blood was also assessed using a TCM4 Transcutaneous Blood Gas Analyzer (Radiometer Copenhagen). Rectal temperature was maintained at 37°C during the experiments by a feedback‐controlled, water‐circulating heating pad. At the end of the fMRI experiment, medetomidine was antagonized by an intraperitoneal injection of atipamezole (0.1 mg/kg; Antisedan, 5 mg/mL, Orion Pharma). \n\n\n### Imaging protocol \n  \nImages were acquired at 7 T on a Bruker Pharmascan (Bruker BioSpin, DE) in a double coil configuration. A 72‐mm i.d. single channel transmission‐only resonator was actively decoupled with a four‐channel phased‐array receive‐only surface coil optimized for the rat brain. \n\nAfter a scout image, T2w RARE images (TR = 5500 ms, TE = 76 ms, NEX = 8, MTX = 128 × 128 × 25, FOV = 35 × 35 × 25 mm, ACQtime = 5 min 20 s) were acquired for anatomical reference and to drive the coregistration step of the preprocessing. Multishot GRE‐EPI pulse sequence was used for functional time series acquisition, with main parameters set as follows: TR = 500 ms, TE = 17 ms, NSHOTS = 4, NEX = 1, MTX = 96 × 96 × 10, FOV = 35 × 35 × 10 mm, NREP = 900, ACQtime = 30 min. Global shimming was refined by localized shimming with FASTMAP protocol. \n\nInstead of the canonical single‐shot EPI, here, we used a segmented EPI sequence as the latter provided a more robust and accurate delineation of connectivity patterns along with a reduction in susceptibility artifacts.  These improvements were more prominent especially in deep brain nuclei and areas of the mesolimbic system, which are of interest for the current study. An additional set of high‐resolution T2w RARE images (MTX = 256 × 256 × 25) was acquired for voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) analysis after the resting state imaging session. \n\n\n### Image analysis \n  \nImages were processed with MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.) and FSL ( /fsl). Raw data were converted to nifti format, and voxel size was scaled by a factor of 10 to be compliant with FSL algorithms. Preprocessing consisted of estimation and regression of motion confounds, slice timing correction, nonlinear high‐pass, and gaussian low‐pass filtering (0.01‐0.1 Hz). Functional images were coregistered by 12 DOF affine transformations to structural T2w anatomical references and then resampled to a rat brain template in standard space.  After rigid body transformation, nonlinear warping to standard space was applied to further refine the normalization and minimize geometric distortions. \n\n\n### Resting state networks identification \n  \nIndependent component analysis with a high number of components (  n   = 70) was run at the subject level. ICA components were then hand‐classified in a randomly sampled subset of subjects and labelled as noise or signal on the basis of spatial maps, frequency content, and features of time‐course. This approach was effective in separating components related to subtle whole‐head motion, CSF flow, ghosting, and between‐shots motion artifacts. Spatial maps not related to anatomical structures, characterized by shifts towards high frequencies in the power spectrum or corrupted by clearly visible spikes, were classified as noise. Labels were used to train an automated classifier, and nonaggressive regression of noisy components was applied to the whole set of functional images. The performance of the classifier was assessed running a leave‐one‐out accuracy test using the previously defined set of hand‐classified components. Denoised data were finally used to compute group level ICA with a reduced number of components (d = 20) in order to obtain a functional parcellation of the rat brain ( ). \n\n\n### Dual regression and connectivity of resting state components \n  \nComponents obtained at the group level in the previous step were then used to feed a dual regression analysis.  In the first step, independent component maps were used as spatial regressors to obtain subject specific time series for each component. These time courses were then regressed against functional data to obtain subject specific version of the considered component. For each of these ICA‐derived network, we considered the average value of the z‐statistic image as a metric to quantify within‐component coherence at the subject level.  Time courses returned by the first step of dual regression were further used as input for network modelling (FSLNets), to assess the correlation between components and investigate how specific patterns of correlation could be altered either by ethanol exposure or pharmacological treatment. Artifactual components were excluded from the analysis by regressing out the corresponding time series. After this process, a total of seven functionally relevant components, involved in salience and reward processing, were considered for subsequent statistical analysis. Partial correlation between each pair of components was calculated for every subject and converted to z‐statistic via standard Fisher's transform. These matrices were ultimately grouped to model between and within factors of a conventional two‐way ANOVA analysis. An unpaired (between subjects) nonparametric test was run on correlation matrices with 5000 permutations to test for condition‐specific differences in PD and alcohol‐naive rats. Two paired nonparametric tests were conducted within subjects for each group to assess differences in resting‐state connectivity introduced by acute administration of the D3 antagonist SB‐277011A. The interaction   Ethanol history condition × Treatment   was evaluated with a two‐stage approach: first, paired (vehicle vs drug) differences of correlation matrices were computed for each group; the results were finally compared with an unpaired (PD vs ND) nonparametric test between conditions. The same statistical approach was used to test within‐component functional connectivity changes induced by phenotype or treatment. \n\n\n### Voxel‐based morphometry \n  \nT2w RARE images, acquired at high resolution, were analysed to investigate voxelwise differences in local grey matter (GM) volume using a modified version of the FSL‐VBM tool of FSL  to account for rat brain specific issues.  Briefly: an unbiased GM template was created by averaging group‐balanced GM images (n = 12 ND and n = 12 PD rats). Individual GM volumes were registered to the unbiased template using the FSL FNIRT algorithm  and then modulated (to correct for local deformations) by the Jacobian of the warp field, as reported in Ashburner and Friston.  The modulated GM images were then smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a σ of 2.0 mm, and a nonparametric permutation test was applied. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### ICA‐based functional parcellation \n  \nFigure   shows the seven functionally relevant components identified by group ICA and known to be involved in AUD. Their spatial maps were used to extract the time‐series and compute network functional correlation. \n  \nFunctional parcellation of the rat brain. Spatial distribution (left side) and color‐coded volume rendering (right side) of the seven meaningful components identified with ICA \n  \nThe components were named according to the underlying anatomy as follow: orbitofrontal‐prelimbic cortex (OFC‐PrL); accumbens (Acb); caudate putamen‐anterior insula (CPu‐AntIns); cingulate cortex (CgC); insula (Ins); retrosplenial Cortex (RsC); and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Because the ICA‐based parcellation is a data‐driven method that relies on statistical features of the voxel‐wise signal, functional regions of interest may comprise multiple anatomically defined brain regions, as in the case of the OFC‐PrL and CPu‐AntIns components. \n\n\n### Reduced functional connectivity within resting‐state components \n  \nWe considered the average value of the z‐statistic image as a metric to quantify within‐component coherence at the subject level. The between group statistical analysis revealed a widespread reduction of large‐scale functional connectivity after CIE, particularly within the OFC‐PrL (*p  < 0.05), Acb (*p  < 0.01), and CPu‐AntIns (*p  < 0.05) components (Figure  A,B,C respectively). Noteworthy, a significant   Ethanol history condition × treatment   interaction ( p  < 0.05), but not treatment, was observed for the Acb component, suggesting that SB‐277011‐a modulated the connectivity of the Acb network differentially in the two groups of rats (PD vs ND). This effect may be the result of a dysregulation of dopamine receptor expression previously observed in PD rats. \n  \nWithin component connectivity. Significant alteration of within component connectivity is detected in A, OFC‐PrL, B, Acb, and C, CPu‐AntIns.

Significant   Ethanol history condition × treatment   interaction   P   < 0.05 \n  \n\n### A history of ethanol exposure altered the insular cortex connectivity \n  \nUnpaired nonparametric test run on vehicle‐treated rats (ND vs PD) showed CIE‐induced alteration of functional synchrony between different pairs of regions, reported in Figure  A. Specifically, alcohol exposure decreased connectivity between the components CPu‐AntIns and Ins (Figure  A,   *  p  < 0.05). Reduced correlation was also observed between the CgC and Ins (Figure  B, *p  < 0.05), which are commonly identified as constituents of the salience network.  Additionally, decreased coupling was found between the retrosplenial cortex (RsC) and the nucleus accumbens (Acb) (*p  < 0.05) (see Figure  A). On the other hand, CIE strengthened functional coupling between areas of the mesolimbic system and regions of the salience network, specifically between VTA and CgC, VTA and CPu‐AntIns, and between Acb and Ins (Figure  A,B,C, respectively, *p  < 0.05). Analysis of the effect of SB‐277011‐a revealed that the D3 antagonist does not significantly alter functional connectivity in ND rats (Figure  B), whereas it shows a normalizing effect in the PD group (Figure  C). In particular, acute administration of SB‐277011‐a in PD rats appears to restore the normal functional connectivity of the salience network: indeed, a significant increase in the strength of connectivity between the insular and cingulate cortex is observed in PD rats treated with the D3 antagonist compared with the vehicle group (CgC and Ins, Figure  B,  p  < 0.05). \n  \nModulation of between component connectivity after exposure to ethanol A, and acute administration of SB‐277011‐a in the nondependent B, and the postdependent group C.

Significant   Ethanol history condition × treatment   interaction   P   < 0.05 \n  \nConsidering the contrasting results showing a decrease  or an increase in functional coherence of the salience network in alcoholics,  we performed additional, hypothesis‐driven seed‐based analysis with the agranular insula as anatomical seed to further corroborate our finding of a weaker correlation between the cingulate and the IC in PD rats, as well as of a restorative effect of SB‐277011‐a. This seed‐based approach confirmed the results of our network correlation analysis, showing attenuation of CgC‐Ins connectivity and normalization of the correlation strength after treatment with SB‐277011‐a in the PD group (see SI,  ). \n\nWith regards to the increased connectivity observed after CIE between regions of the mesolimbic system and constituents of the salience network, again results showed an effect of SB‐277011‐a in attenuating the correlation between the VTA and cingulate cortex heightened by CIE in the PD group with a significant   Ethanol history condition × Treatment   interaction (Figure  A,  p  < 0.05 and  p  < 0.05). \n\nLastly, in PD rats, SB‐277011‐a also increased the correlation coefficient between the OFC and the Acb  ,   an effect not observed in the ND group (Figure  C). \n\n\n### Voxel‐based morphometry \n  \nStatistical analysis of structural imaging revealed no significant effect of CIE on GM volume between PD and ND vehicle‐treated rats (TFCE corrected   P   = 0.3). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nOur results support the notion of widespread alterations in brain functional connectivity during early abstinence from alcohol dependence. The use of a well‐established rodent model of AUD allows us to causally link alcohol to the observed change in functional connectivity during abstinence. Thereby, we can exclude potentially confounding factors such as nicotine use, other psychiatric comorbidities, or variable times of abstinence that typically hamper studies in clinical populations. Further, we demonstrate that such aberrant “abstinence network” states can be modified and at least partially reversed by pharmacotherapy, which suggests that fMRI‐derived brain connectivity networks could be a potential biomarker for medication development. \n\nUsing a data‐driven approach including unbiased independent component analysis, we found weaker internal coherence in addiction relevant components, specifically within the Acb‐, OFC‐PrL‐, and CPu‐AntIns components, of PD rats compared with alcohol‐naive animals. This finding concurs with a study by Diaz‐Parra and colleagues who showed by network‐based statistic the disconnection of a subnetwork comprising the hippocampus and other subcortical structures in PD rats compared with controls.  Together with alteration of within‐component connectivity, CIE induced changes in between‐components connectivity, especially involving the IC. Indeed, PD rats showed a decrease in functional coupling between subregions of the IC, namely the Ins and CPu‐Ins components, and between the CgC and the Ins, elements of the salience network. On the other hand, a history of ethanol dependence strengthened the correlation between components of the salience network and mesolimbic areas. \n\nInterestingly and in line with the restricted expression pattern of D3 receptors, ,   SB‐277011‐a modulated Acb connectivity differentially in PD and ND rats. This effect could be due to the dysregulation of dopaminergic striatal systems observed in alcohol exposed rats during protracted withdrawal as well as in AUD patients. ,   Furthermore, SB‐277011‐a partially restored aberrant connectivity in PD rats but had no significant effects in alcohol‐naive rats. Given that we did not find structural differences between PD and ND rats according to VBM, the differential effect of SB‐277011‐a is likely due to differences in neural responsivity to the drug. Such an augmented response of neurochemical systems that are involved in the processing of alcohol's pharmacological effects has been found for a number of compounds, reviewed in Meinhardt and Sommer,  and is an important feature of the PD model for medication development in AUD. \n\nOur results in rodents showing aberrant functional connectivity of the IC are consistent with the implication of this area in drug addiction including alcoholism. ,  ,  ,  ,   The general notion emerging from these studies is that drug craving and cue‐induced urges can be considered as complex interoceptive emotions that are processed in and mapped to the IC, particularly in its anterior part, whereby the precise mechanisms of its involvement remain unclear. On one hand, several studies in humans and animals indicated diminished drug‐seeking behaviors by insula lesions, ,   an effect that was even more pronounced by combined damage of insula and putamen,  thus suggesting an abnormal connectivity of these two regions in addiction. Contrary to a general facilitatory role of the insula for drug seeking, reduced insula function was found in AUD subjects measured as a perfusion deficit in arterial spin‐labelling MRI,  and alcoholism is also associated with a loss of insula GM.  Together, these findings indicate a highly complex involvement of insula in the control of addictive behaviors. Here, we found decreased resting state synchrony between the CPu‐AntIns and Ins components as sequalae to chronic alcohol exposure in the absence of any morphometric changes to this brain region. The lack of overt structural damage to the insula in our preparation may not be surprising. In contrast to humans, where severe AUD takes decades to develop, the CIE procedure lasts only for about 2 months, which is apparently not sufficient to generate an advanced or end stage AUD condition. Nevertheless, our findings suggest insula involvement already early in the disease trajectory and that functional deficits may precede structural damage to this region. \n\nThe insula as a crucial node of the salience network is thought to be involved in directing attentional resources, accessing executive control processes, and driving behaviour. ,   With regards to the AUD, decreased within‐network connectivity of the salience network was found by resting‐state fMRI,  although another study reported the opposite effect.  This inconsistency may be caused by differences in study populations. Importantly, a recent meta‐analysis reported significantly decreased recruitment of the salience network during inhibitory control tasks in 30 reviewed studies investigating response inhibition in addicted individuals.  This finding parallels reports of increased measures of impulsivity in rodents with a history of chronic alcohol exposure. ,  ,   Besides decreased connectivity within the salience network, we also observed increased coupling between constituents of the salience and the reward system in PD rats. Similarly, human drug users showed tightened coupling between the salience and the reward networks.  This finding was interpreted as a neural substrate of the increased salience given to the drug or drug‐associated cues after chronic consumption as predicted by common theories of addiction. ,  ,   The aberrant connectivity we observed between the Acb‐Ins in PD rats is consistent with this interpretation. Altered connectivity between these two regions is also suggested by Seif and colleagues, who demonstrated a critical role for the insula‐to‐accumbens inputs in mediating aversion‐resistant alcohol intake in rodents.  Furthermore, we found increased connectivity between VTA and CgC in alcohol exposed rats. CgC provides top‐down control to the VTA thereby modulating the motivation to pursue a reward.  This pathway is also implicated in the inhibition of cocaine seeking in rats. \n\nNotably, treatment with SB‐277011‐a restored the aberrant connectivity within the salience network components and between salience and reward networks in PD rats. It seems plausible to hypothesize that these fMRI signatures could be related to the compound's efficacy in cue‐induced, stress‐induced, and drug‐induced reinstatement of drug seeking including in rodent models of AUD. ,  ,  ,  ,   With regard to PD rats, at the time of the fMRI investigation, ie, 3 to 4 weeks of abstinence, they are in a hyperdopaminergic state.  This dysregulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system may drive the increased functional connectivity between VTA and CgC components observed here and reversed by SB‐277011‐a. \n\nThe present study was performed under anaesthesia using the alpha‐2‐adrenergic agonist medetomidine. This method was recently introduced for fMRI studies in rodents ,   particularly because it does not require catheterization and assisted breathing, thus allowing for longitudinal experimental designs. Importantly, low doses of medetomidine, as we used here, produce sedation, rather than full anaesthesia, and thus may preserve, at least to some extent, the integrity of functional connectivity networks, as reported in previous studies. ,   Furthermore, measurement of functional connectivity in awake animals may be affected by motion and stress. \n\nIn conclusion, by means of a hypothesis free analysis, our study showed that a history of alcohol dependence alters brain connectivity at rest with a prominent involvement of networks comprising the IC. Specifically, we observed weaker connectivity between insular and cingulate cortex in the salience network, and stronger connectivity between the insula and constituents of the mesolimbic reward system. Importantly, acute administration of the D3 selective antagonist, SB‐277011‐a, a compound shown to decrease drug consumption and relapse in animals models of abuse, including alcohol, normalized the aberrant connectivity induced by CIE to ethanol. This study suggests that modulation of specific nodes in the networks involved in addiction may normalize the overall brain connectivity, thus shedding new light on the putative underlying mechanism of action. \n\n\n## DISCLOSURES \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION \n  \nG.S., A.B., and W.H.S. were responsible for the study concept and design.

While numerous imaging studies have investigated the effects of ketamine on a functional macroscopic brain level, it remains unclear how altered glutamate metabolism and changes in brain function are linked. To shed light on this topic we here conducted a multimodal imaging study in healthy volunteers (  N   = 23) using resting state fMRI and proton ( H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate linkage between metabolic and functional brain changes induced by ketamine. Subjects were investigated before and during an intravenous ketamine infusion. The MRS voxel was placed in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), as this region has been repeatedly shown to be involved in ketamine’s effects. Our results showed functional connectivity changes from the pgACC to the right frontal pole and anterior mid cingulate cortex (aMCC). Absolute glutamate and glutamine concentrations in the pgACC did not differ significantly from baseline. However, we found that stronger pgACC activation during ketamine was linked to lower glutamine concentration in this region. Furthermore, reduced functional connectivity between pgACC and aMCC was related to increased pgACC activation and reduced glutamine. Our results thereby demonstrate how multimodal investigations in a single brain region could help to advance our understanding of the association between metabolic and functional changes. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOver the last 2 decades, ketamine has become an important research tool to investigate rapid antidepressant mechanisms of action [ ]. It has been repeatedly shown that antidepressant effects of ketamine occur within 24 h after a single dose [ ]. On the one hand, this allows for the study of antidepressant mechanisms, as it enables to establish a direct link between the drug and its effects. But on the other, the molecular and systemic changes ketamine induces in the central nervous system are notoriously complex and it is a matter of ongoing research to pin down which of these changes bring forward the antidepressant effects. Despite many unanswered questions, there is a broad consensus that the antidepressant effects of ketamine are linked to changes in the glutamatergic system [ ], and there is evidence that altered glutamatergic signaling leads to intercellular signaling cascades that induce synaptic plasticity, which has been associated with ketamine’s antidepressant effects in behavioral animal models [ ]. Furthermore, a considerable amount of imaging studies investigated the effects of ketamine on functional brain activations and networks in humans [ ]. Although the results of this research have not yet converged, and no clear antidepressant mechanism of action has been identified, some interesting themes and involved brain regions, such as the anterior cingulate cortex [ ], have emerged. However, evidence remains sparse how ketamine-induced molecular changes in the glutamatergic system are linked to macroscopic functional activation and network changes in the human brain. \n\nConsidering the important role of glutamate (Glu) in synaptic transmission and plasticity, perturbation of the glutamatergic system is considered one of the factors involved in the pathophysiology of depression, while Glu modulation may induce rapid relief of depressive symptoms [ – ]. Glutamate is synthesized in the presynaptic terminal from glutamine (Gln), and then released into the synaptic cleft. Astrocytes provide the primary mechanism for clearance from the synaptic cleft, by means of uptake by amino acid transporters. Once in the astrocyte, Glu is converted to Gln by the Gln synthetase. Gln is then released into the extracellular space for uptake into the excitatory and the inhibitory neurons, where it is converted back to Glu via glutaminase. This is referred to as the glutamate/glutamine cycle [ ]. Astrocytic pathology and subsequent alterations in this cycle have been implicated in the physiology of depression [ ,  ] with astrocyte-related reductions in conversion of Glu to Gln leading to downstream Glu reduction [ ]. Proton ( H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the only non-invasive method able to directly measure glutamate and glutamine levels in vivo. In some MRS studies, elevated Gln and Glu levels have been linked to depression, while other studies reported reduced concentrations of both Gln and Glu [ – ]. As it is difficult to separate Glu clearly from its precursor and metabolite, Gln, the two compounds are often measured together as Glx and accordingly, inconsistent alterations in Glx have also been reported in depression [ – ]. Thus, based on the current stage of research, it remains unclear how exactly perturbation of the glutamatergic system and depression are linked. A more detailed understanding of this relationship would be helpful to pin down the antidepressant mechanisms of rapid-acting glutamatergic antidepressants such as ketamine. Furthermore, baseline metabolite levels in depressed patients could be established as an indicator of treatment response to medication targeting glutamatergic receptors [ ]. \n\nSeveral lines of investigation have shown that ketamine increases prefrontal Glu levels through NMDA receptor inhibition and subsequent AMPA receptor activation [ – ]. Interestingly, the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) has been found to exhibit above average AMPA receptors and below average NMDA receptor densities (compared with whole cingulate cortex) [ ] and regional variations of Glu and Gln concentrations have been shown to follow these receptor fingerprints [ ]. Abdallah et al. [ ] reported that ketamine increases prefrontal glutamate–glutamine cycling, thereby providing the most direct evidence in humans that ketamine increases glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex. Changes in the pgACC occur within the first 30 min after the start of the ketamine infusion, which supports the idea that the Glu burst happens quite early [ ]. Accordingly, several 1H-MRS investigations noted increased glutamatergic metabolite levels in healthy volunteers [ ,  ] and increased Glx levels in depressed subjects [ ] during acute ketamine administration; the ratio of Gln to Glu was also found to be increased 24 h after acute ketamine administration in healthy volunteers [ ]. Nevertheless, other investigations found no significant changes in Glu measurements 1 h post-ketamine infusion in healthy volunteers [ ], or three and 48 h later in depressed subjects [ ]; variations in voxel location, timing of the scan, imaging parameters, and sample size may explain these discrepant findings. Evans et al. [ ] reported that ketamine did not affect Glu or Gln levels in the pgACC in depressed subjects 24 h post-ketamine infusion and that antidepressant response was not predicted by baseline levels. On the other hand, there are reports of a prediction of treatment response by baseline levels of glutamatergic metabolites as well as of an association between lower Glx response to acute ketamine administration and antidepressant response [ ,  ]. \n\nAs of today, a relatively large number of imaging studies have investigated the effects of ketamine in the human brain [ ]. Although results do not converge into a clear pattern of effects yet, several findings have been replicated in independent studies. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and especially the pre- and subgenual subdivisions, have been repeatedly implicated in the effects of ketamine [ ]. The pregenual ACC (pgACC) plays an important role in emotional processing and establishing mood states [ ,  ], and abnormal pgACC activity has been implicated in depressive pathology [ ,  ]. Furthermore, ketamine-induced changes in functional connectivity between the right lateral PFC and the sgACC have been linked to the reduction of depressive symptoms [ ], which could indicate restored prefrontal cognitive control over emotional processing. Thus, it is likely that ketamine-induced alterations in pgACC and sgACC activity are linked to relief of depressive symptoms. However, despite the extensive study of ketamine using brain imaging in healthy and depressed human subjects, the exact antidepressant mechanism of ketamine remains unclear. Investigating the relationship between ketamine induced metabolic and functional brain changes via multimodal brain imaging is a promising approach to advance our understanding of how ketamine exerts its rapid antidepressant effects. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the link between ketamine-induced alterations in glutamatergic signaling, and altered functional activation, and connectivity has only been investigated in two previous studies. One of these, however, focused on changes 1 h and 24 h after ketamine administration [ ] and reported that altered Gln/Glu concentration 24 h after ketamine was associated with increased functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN). The study by Kraguljac et al. [ ] reported neurometabolite levels and functional connectivity during ketamine infusion, however, focused on the hippocampus which is not part of the neural circuitry of depression and furthermore did not distinguish between Glu and Gln. \n\nBased on prior work demonstrating that changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission in pgACC, a region implicated both in the effects of ketamine and in emotional processing, occur early after the start of the ketamine infusion, our study aimed to investigate acute effects of ketamine on pgACC spontaneous activity, functional connectivity, and Gln/Glu metabolite concentration using a multimodal imaging approach. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe study was performed at the University of Zurich by the Department for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics (Psychiatry University Hospital Zurich) and the Institute for Biomedical Engineering (ETH Zürich). Twenty-three healthy subjects (  n   = 23, mean age, 25.5; 12 males) participated in the MRI study. Resting state fMRI data were available for the entire sample (  N   = 23). Complete MRS data were available for a sub-sample of   N   = 16 participants. MRS data of five subjects had to be excluded because of an error in the MRS sequence. Additionally, MRS data of two subjects could not be analyzed because of a missing high-resolution 3D T1 weighted sequence, which was needed for tissue signal correction. All subjects underwent a medical examination and psychiatric interview based on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; [ ]) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD; [ ]). Only medication-free subjects that were healthy according to the physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood and urine analyses were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were a history of psychiatric/neurological diseases, drug abuse, concurrent medication, cardiovascular disease, anemia, thyroid disease, any somatic disease affecting drug metabolism and excretion (e.g., renal or liver disease), MR exclusion criteria, pregnancy and left-handedness. \n\n\n### Study design \n  \nSubjects completed two separate MRI sessions on a Philips Achieva 3T whole-body MR unit. The first session served as physiological baseline and subjects were not infused with any (pharmacological) agent. In the second session, S-ketamine (Ketanest, Pfizer, Zurich, Switzerland) was administered as an intravenous bolus of 0.12 mg/kg approximately 25 min prior to the MRI, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h during the entire MR scanning period. During the acquisition of resting state, subjects were told to lie still in the scanner with their eyes closed. The functional images were collected in 10 min runs (200 volumes). The interval between the two sessions was 3 days on average. \n\n\n### Data acquisition and analyses \n  \n#### Resting state fMRI \n  \nThe functional images were acquired with a sensitivity-encoded single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence (SENSE-sshEPI) [ ] in 10 min runs (200 vol). Following acquisition parameters were used: TE = 35 ms; field of view (FOV) = 22 cm, acquisition matrix = 80 × 80 interpolated to 128 × 128, TR 3000 ms, flip angle 82°, voxel size = 2.75 × 2.75 × 4 mm, 32 contiguous axial slices (placed along the anterior–posterior commissure plane) and sensitivity-encoded acceleration factor R = 2.0). \n\nThree-dimensional T1-weighted anatomical scans were obtained for structural reference for both, placebo and ketamine conditions individually (T1 3D FFE sequence: TR/TE = 9.3/4.6 ms, flip angle = 8°, 160 sagittal slices, FOV 240 × 240 mm, voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm). \n\nResting state fMRI data were analyzed in MATLAB (VersionR2018b) using SPM12 and the CONN toolbox (Version 20b; [ ]). Preprocessing of fMRI data included removal of the first five scans, motion correction (realignment and unwarping), slice-timing correction, automatic detection of artifactual scans (ART-based scrubbing; 97th percentile), normalization to MNI space (structural target resolution: 1 mm, function target resolution: 2 mm), and spatial smoothing (8 mm). During the denoising step in CONN single-subject linear regression analyses were performed to remove the effects of head motion (12 total motion covariates: 6 motion parameters plus temporal derivatives), physiological artifacts (10 total CompCor eigenvariates: 5 each from eroded WM and CSF masks), and artifactual scans. The resulting residual BOLD time series were band-pass filtered (0.01–0.1 Hz). Spontaneous neural activity was calculated using   fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations   (fALFF) as implemented in the CONN toolbox [ ]. The pgACC ROI used for the functional imaging analysis was created based on previous publications (MNI coordinates: 0, 42, 2; diameter: 10 mm; [ ,  ]). \n\n\n#### MRS \n  \nThe high-resolution 3D T1 was used to plan the MRS acquisition and calculate the tissue composition of the voxel. Spectra were acquired with a maximum echo-sampled J-resolved PRESS sequence (JPRESS; [ ]) including second-order B0 shimming with VAPOR water suppression [ ] and outer volume suppression (OVS) and inner volume saturation (IVS) [ ,  ]. The voxel size was 25 × 18 × 20 mm  (AP × LR × FH). JPRESS was implemented as two-dimensional echo time series with a minimum echo time (TE) of 30 ms and repetition time (TR) of 1600 ms. 100 echo steps (step size = 2 ms) with 8 water suppressed signal averages (NSA) per echo step and non-water suppressed reference were acquired covering the range from 30 to 228 ms with a total number of signal averages of 800 (acquisition time: 24 min). The 2D technique allows disentangling of the signals of overlaying metabolite resonances by encoding the chemical shift information in the first dimension and the J-coupling information in the second dimension. Therefore, the signals of usually overlapping (in 1D) metabolites such as Glutamine (Gln) and Glutamate (Glu) can be identified independently. \n\nThe MRS data were analyzed with ProFit2 (Prior-knowledge Fitting) including 18 metabolites [ ]. The basis set consisted of 18 metabolites including Glu, Gln and GABA. A chemical shift range was covered in the first dimension from 0.5 to 4 ppm and in the second dimension from − 0.4 to 0.4. Processing steps included a Hankel singular value decomposition (HSVD) water filter, eddy current, and zero- and first-phase correction. Artefact inspection for bad water suppression, line shape distortion or ghosting was conducted visually. The amount of water signal measured in the non-water suppressed reference acquisition was used as internal reference. In addition, with a custom-written MATLAB script tissue composition correction (CSF, WM, GM) was conducted to report metabolite concentration values with respect to internal water [ ]. Results from the MRS analysis for one representative subject are shown in Fig.  .   \nMRS analyses.

For some exploratory analysis and visualization purposes, we used a voxel threshold of   p   < 0.05. This liberal voxel threshold was penalized with a strict cluster correction level of p-FDR < 0.001. Correlations between imaging modalities were calculated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (alpha level = 0.05). For each modality, combination results were FDR corrected. However, uncorrected results are reported as well, and marked as such. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Spontaneous brain activation \n  \nThe whole-brain analysis of spontaneous brain activation revealed stronger activation of the left anterior insula, and deactivation in the right lingual gyrus and the right occipital pole under ketamine (Fig.  A, Table  ). The exploratory analysis revealed a clear picture of activation in multiple prefrontal brain regions, and deactivation in multiple posterior brain regions (Fig.  B). The ROI analysis in the pgACC revealed no significant change between baseline activations and activations during the ketamine infusion (  t  (22) = − 1.38,   p   = 0.18). On the descriptive level, pgACC activations were increased during ketamine (  M   = 0.13, SD = 0.51) compared to baseline (  M   = − 0.05, SD = 0.51).   \nSpontaneous brain activation during ketamine.

However, a trend towards increased Glu concentration during ketamine was observed. On the descriptive level, metabolite concentrations were increased for Glu and decreased for Gln and the Gln/Glu ratio (Table  ).   \nMetabolite concentrations at baseline and during ketamine \n  \n\n\n### Activity changes in pgACC linked to altered metabolite concentration \n  \nCorrelation analyses (Pearson’s correlation coefficient) between pgACC activity changes and changes in   showed a significant association for Gln (  r   = − 0.54,   p   = 0.033) and the Gln/Glu ratio (  r   = − 0.59,   p   = 0.017). Increased activity in the pgACC during ketamine was linked to lower Gln concentration in the pgACC and to a lower Gln/Glu ratio (Fig.  ). No significant relationship was observed for Glu (  r   = 0.17,   p   = 0.52).   \nRelationship between changes in pgACC activation and metabolite levels.

A relationship was observed between pgACC activation and reduced rsFC to the aMCC (  r   = − 0.45,   p   = 0.032, Fig.  A). Furthermore, a marginally significant relationship was observed between Gln levels and pgACC-aMCC connectivity (  r   = 0.48,   p   = 0.062, Fig.  B).   \nRelationship between changes in pgACC functional connectivity, activation, and metabolite levels.

In particular, we investigated how changes in the individual imaging modalities were interrelated to gain a better understanding of how molecular and macroscopic brain changes induced by ketamine are linked. We focused our analysis on the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) because ketamine-induced brain changes have been repeatedly reported in this region, and the specific receptor profile of this region suggests that the antidepressant mechanism of ketamine might be linked to metabolic changes in this region. \n\nROI analysis in the pgACC showed no significant change between baseline activation and activation during the ketamine infusion. While previous reports are rather consistent regarding decreased activation in the sgACC during a ketamine infusion [ – ], evidence for pgACC is less clear [ ]. Downey et al. [ ] found increased activation during ketamine in a region at the border between the pgACC and the sgACC, and Javitt et al. [ ] found widespread frontal activation that included the pgACC during ketamine. These findings suggest that ketamine-induced activity changes in the pgACC and sgACC could point into opposite directions. Further, regarding spontaneous brain activations during ketamine, the whole-brain analysis conducted in our study showed increases in the left anterior insula and decreases in occipital regions. Ketamine-induced activation of the insula has also been previously reported in healthy subjects [ ,  ]. The insula is a central node of the salience network (SN) and thought to mediate interpretation of sensory information that contributes to emotional states [ ]. Furthermore, strong connectivity to nodes of the anterior DMN underlines the insula’s hypothesized role in switching between the DMN and executive control network (ECN; [ ,  ]). Thus, increased activation of the insula during ketamine might be linked to switching from DMN to activation of other networks. This is line with previous findings suggesting that the antidepressant effects of ketamine are linked to reduced activity in brain networks related to self-referential processing [ ]. Interestingly, a noticeably clear pattern of frontal activation, and posterior deactivation was observed when a more liberal statistical voxel threshold was applied. Strong frontal activation patterns induced by ketamine correspond to “hyperfrontality” reported in several previous studies and might be related to altered interpretation of visual and spatial information about the external and internal reality [ – ]. \n\nStronger functional connectivity (FC) during ketamine was observed between the pgACC and the right frontal pole. FC between the right frontal pole and the subgenual ACC has previously been linked to the antidepressant effects of ketamine 24 h after the infusion [ ] and might reflect the restoration of cognitive control over aberrant emotion processing in limbic structures [ ,  ]. Decreased FC was observed between the pgACC and the anterior mid cingulate cortex (aMCC), a region implicated in cognitive aspects of motor control [ ], and the experience of negative affect and pain [ ]. As the pgACC is involved in the subjective experience of affect [ ], its decoupling from the aMCC might be linked to altered processing of emotion. The decoupling from a region involved in motor control might also be linked to the feeling of disembodiment, which is a core feature of the subjective experience during a ketamine infusion [ ]. \n\nNo absolute changes in metabolic Glu, Gln, and Gln/Glu concentrations were observed, but there was a trend towards Glu increases during ketamine and descriptively Gln and Gln/Glu were reduced during ketamine. The lack of significance could be due to the rather small sample size in our study, but it should be noted that on the descriptive level the results regarding Glu are consistent with previous findings and support the idea that changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission happen quite early after the start of the ketamine infusion [ ,  ]. Increased Glu concentration after ketamine has been linked to NMDA receptor inhibition and subsequent AMPA receptor activation [ – ]. Since the pgACC exhibits above average AMPA and below average NMDA receptor densities [ ], the Glu response to a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine may be associated with the histoarchitectonical receptor fingerprint of this brain region. \n\nRegarding cross-modality associations, our results showed that increased pgACC activation was linked to lower Gln concentration and a lower Gln/Glu ratio in the pgACC. Gln is seen as the non-neuroactive precursor and metabolite in the glutamate–glutamine cycle, enabling the right amount of physiological Glu neuron firing [ ]. Some studies in depressed subjects reported increased Gln levels [ ,  ,  ,  ] as well as lower baseline Gln predicting better clinical outcome [ ]. Along that line, a recent study by Milak et al. [ ] demonstrated that the lower the Glx response to ketamine, the better the antidepressant response. Activity in pgACC during emotional and cognitive tasks not only predicts antidepressant response to ketamine [ ,  ], but the pgACC is currently the best supported candidate for a general neuroimaging biomarker for antidepressant response [ ]. It has been proposed that an increased activity state of the pgACC may represent its treatment-responsive mode and be specifically important for clinical effects of rapid-acting glutamatergic drugs such as ketamine [ ,  ,  ]. Therefore, our findings might indicate that acute ketamine administration increases pgACC activity, which would correspond to a treatment-responsive mode in depressed subjects. This might be accompanied by a surge of Glu, but initially lower Glu conversion in glial cells, resulting in a decreased Gln concentration as well as a lower Gln/Glu ratio [ ]. Though speculative, in depressed patients, these changes might then eventually trigger the antidepressant effects of ketamine that occur within the first hours after a single dose of ketamine. Findings by Li et al. [ ] indicate a reversal of this pattern 24 h after ketamine, i.e., an increased Gln/ Glu ratio in the pgACC, which might reflect secondary effects. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting linkage between ketamine-induced changes in glutamatergic metabolites and spontaneous activation in the same region. While Li et al. [ ] reported an association of glutamatergic metabolites and FC within the DMN as well as between FC and spontaneous brain activation at 1 h and 24 h after ketamine, they did not investigate the acute stage and did not report on all cross-modality associations. \n\nSeveral other studies have reported positive associations, BOLD responses and glutamatergic metabolite concentrations [ ,  ]; however, a recent systematic review reports no coherent relationship between glutamate and BOLD activation [ ]. One possible reason for this could be that the majority of studies did not separate Glu and Gln due to methodological difficulties, but rather report the two compounds together as Glx. Our finding points out the importance of detailed investigations of both compounds to better understand the effects of ketamine on the glutamatergic system, since Glx measurement might obscure important findings that are linked to only one of the metabolites. \n\nOur results also suggest that lower Gln concentration and stronger spontaneous activation of the pgACC during ketamine might be associated with reduced functional connectivity to the aMCC. While the FC result has been discussed above, this result suggests that both altered activation and metabolism are also linked to this change in FC. It is intriguing to speculate about the directionality of the relationships in this triangle, however, due to the purely correlative nature of this analysis such inferences cannot be made. It could be hypothesized that altered glutamatergic signaling in the pgACC brings forward changes in functional activations, and connectivity (and not the other way around). To investigate this hypothesis, upcoming studies could include a condition in which glutamatergic signaling is blocked by another compound such as Lamotrigine. \n\nThe main limitation of this study is the rather small sample size, and the results reported here must be replicated in larger cohorts. However, the reported effect sizes in the correlation analyses suggest meaningful results, and the scatterplots show that effects are not driven by outliers. Furthermore, to shed some more light on ketamine’s effect on glutamatergic neurotransmission, future studies should not only include a control group, but also an experimental group where Glu signaling is inhibited. \n\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate how multimodal investigations in a single brain region could help to advance our understanding of how metabolic changes in the glutamatergic system are linked to changes in functional activations and connectivity. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"827c391cfdc19b529d955e56f759d195"},

Alteration in FCN is believed to have the potential to locate biomarkers for classifying or predicting schizophrenia (SZ) from healthy control. However, the traditional FCN analysis with stationary assumption, i.e., static functional connectivity network (SFCN) at the time only measures the simple functional connectivity among brain regions, ignoring the dynamic changes of functional connectivity and the high-order dynamic interactions. In this article, the dynamic functional connectivity network (DFCN) is constructed to delineate the characteristic of connectivity variation across time. A high-order functional connectivity network (HFCN) designed based on DFCN, could characterize more complex spatial interactions across multiple brain regions with the potential to reflect complex functional segregation and integration. Specifically, the temporal variability and the high-order network topology features, which characterize the brain FCNs from region and connectivity aspects, are extracted from DFCN and HFCN, respectively. Experiment results on SZ identification prove that our method is more effective (i.e., obtaining a significantly higher classification accuracy, 81.82%) than other competing methods.   Post hoc   inspection of the informative features in the individualized classification task further could serve as the potential biomarkers for identifying associated aberrant connectivity in SZ. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSchizophrenia (SZ) is a serious chronic mental disorder ( ) that affects the brain, with the symptoms typically including hallucinations, delusions, emotional disturbances and confusion in language and behavior ( ). Due to the complexity of the brain, the heterogeneity of disease, and the overlapping symptoms between different psychiatric disorders, clinical diagnosis is still difficult ( ). Despite decades of research, the pathological mechanism of SZ is still not well understood. Research suggests that SZ may have differences in the connectivity of brain regions ( ;  ). \n\nBenefiting from the development of neuroimaging and computer technology, resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fMRI), measuring the low-frequency fluctuations in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, have been proved to capture spontaneous neural activity of the brain that reflects functional organization ( ;  ). Graph theory-based brain networks can effectively represent the coordinated interactions of neural activities between different ROIs/nodes and reflect the functional connectivity (FC; edges between nodes) in the complex brain ( ;  ). A series of functional brain network construction methods based on BOLD signals such as correlation-based methods ( ) and sparse-learning-based methods ( ;  ) have been widely applied in brain disease diagnosis. For instance,   remodeled the functional brain network for autism spectrum disorder diagnosis based on Pearson’s correlation [PC; the most commonly used correlation-based method ( )] using sparsity and scale-free prior, respectively.   constructed a weighted graph regularized sparse brain network for mild cognitive impairment diagnosis. However, these methods assumed the temporal stationarity of functional brain network (aka, static functional connectivity network, SFCN) across the duration of the scan, which ignore the rich dynamic information during scan. The dynamic interactions of ROIs may be critical for diagnosing brain disorders. \n\nResearchers suggest that through dynamic reconfiguration of the brain, its various parts can adaptively coordinate and integrate in response to rapidly changing stimuli ( ;  ). To capture dynamic interactions between ROIs, dynamic FCN (DFCN), constructed with the sliding window method ( ), could consider the changing characteristics of the brain and simulate these changes by measuring the correlation of brain regions in a short period ( ). For instance,   used the sliding window method and PC to construct a DFCN for the identification of early mild cognitive impairment.   proposed a DFCN-based temporal variability measure to discover differences in the temporal variability of brain networks in subjects with different diseases through the diagnosis of multiple brain diseases. DFCN can simply and effectively represent the dynamic changes in the interaction patterns between ROIs, but cannot represent the complex interaction patterns between multiple brain regions in a deeper way. Neurological findings have demonstrated that a brain region predominantly interacts directly with multiple ROIs in neurological processes ( ). \n\nHigh-order functional connectivity network (HFCN) has great potential for mining complex spatial interactions across multiple brain regions. Many studies have proposed different HFCN construction methods. For instance, through extracting the FC series from the DFCN,   proposed to cluster them and constructed the HFCN based on the pairwise correlation of averaged FC series.   proposed a multi-level HFCN construction method based on SFCN. A multi-level high-order network is obtained through the “correlation’s correlation” strategy, and then features are extracted from each level of the network for autism classification.   proposed an ultra-least squares group constrained ultra-orthogonal least squares regression algorithm to construct low-order and high-order brain function networks, and successfully realized the prediction of mild cognitive impairment. High-order networks can provide additional spatial information for disease identification by characterizing complex brain region interactions. However, most traditional functional brain network analysis focus on DFCN or HFCN, which may ignore the complementarity that exists between them. \n\nIn this article, we propose a temporal-spatial dynamic functional connectivity method for the diagnosis of SZ. Specifically, the sliding window method is used to construct the DFCN of each subject, and the HFCN is constructed based on DFCN, and then two different features are extracted from these two networks respectively. The features extracted from DFCN reflect the relationship of brain functional network connectivity over time, which called temporal variability. The features extracted from HFCN represent the functional interaction between different modules in the brain network to a certain extent, reflecting the modularity of the brain network, which called spatial variability. Through fusing these two kinds of features that characterize the brain FCNs from region and connectivity aspects, we utilize Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) ( ) for feature selection and build a linear classifier for identification of SZ and HC. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Materials \n  \n#### Data acquisition \n  \nThe rs-fMRI data comes from the Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE ), which contains 57 SZ subjects and 64 HC subjects. The detailed information of the dataset is shown in  . According to the fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria, the diagnosis of SZ is identified by psychiatrist and symptom is assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). All subjects are screened and excluded if (1) history of DSM-IV disorders; (2) history of significant head trauma; and (3) history of substance abuse. The single-shot full k-space echo-planar imaging (EPI) with ramp sampling correction using the inter-commissural line (AC-PC) as a reference is used to obtain rest data, where repetition time (TR)/time-of-echo (TE) = 2,000/30 ms, in-plane voxel = 64 × 64, 32 slices, voxel size = 3 mm × 3 mm × 4 mm, field of view (FOV) = 256 mm × 256 mm and number of volumes = 150. \n  \nDemographic information of the participants from COBRE dataset. \n    \n\n#### Data preprocessing \n  \nThe first 10 volumes are discarded to allow for scanner stabilization and the subjects’ adaptation to environment. The remain volumes are preprocessed using DPABI toolbox ( ). The processing flow includes slice timing correction, realignment, spatial normalization [a standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, resampled to 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm], and spatial smoothing using an 8 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. The band-pass filter (0.01–0.08 Hz) is used to reduce low frequency drift and high frequency physiological noise. The automated anatomical labeling atlas (AAL2) ( ) is used to parcellate the brain into 120 ROIs. After data preprocessing, the mean time series are extracted from each ROI, and the time point signal of each ROI is normalized. \n\n\n\n### Construction of low-order functional connectivity network \n  \n#### Construction of static functional connectivity network \n  \nPearson’s correlation measures the functional connectivity of ROIs by calculating the correlation coefficient between the average rs-fMRI time series of ROIs, defines as \n\nwhere   x   = [  x  ,  x  ,⋯,  x  ] ∈ ℝ  and   x   = [  x  ,  x  ,⋯,   x  ] ∈ ℝ    denote the average rs-fMRI time series from the   i  -th and   j  -th ROIs respectively.   M   = 140 is the length of the time series. The   and   are the mean value of   x   and   x   respectively, and   W   reflects the correlation between the   i  -th and   j  -th ROIs. The whole brain PC matrix is   W   =   X   X   ∈ ℝ , where   X   = [  x  ,  x  ,⋯,  x  ] ∈ ℝ  denotes the whole-brain BOLD signals, and   N   = 120 denotes the number of ROIs.   W   characterizes the static correlation of a pair of ROIs throughout the scan time, which ignores dynamic interaction information in the rs-fMRI signal. \n\n\n#### Construction of dynamic functional connectivity network \n  \nTo capture the dynamic nature of neural activity, the entire BLOD time series is partitioned into multiple segments of overlapping subseries to construct the sub-networks using a sliding window method. As shown in  , the number of subseries   K   is \n  \nFramework for construction of DFCN and HFCN. The DFCN is first constructed by computing the PC coefficient under   k   different sub-windows based on the BOLD signal. Then the DFCNs of all subjects are stacked to extract FC time series and clustered. Finally, the HFCN is obtained by calculating the PC of different FC sequence clusters. The figure in the upper right illustrates the dimension reduction of higher-order networks through clustering. \n  \nwhere ⌈⌉ denotes the ceiling function, and Δ denotes the sliding step.   L   represents the length of the window. It is worth noting that a smaller   L   can capture short-term inter-ROIs dynamic interactions, but is also more susceptible to noise. Correspondingly, a larger   L   is not conducive to the detection of dynamic interaction information between brain regions.   L   = {20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70} will be automatically searched in subsequent experiments. The step size is uniformly set to 1, since a smaller Δ can obtain more subsequences to make the results more continuous. \n\nBased on the above, suppose that   x  (  k  ) = [  x  (  k  ),   x  (  k  ),⋯,  x  (  k  )] ∈ ℝ   (  k   = 1,2,⋯,  K  ) denotes the average region time series of   i  -th brain region under the   k  -th sub-time window, the PC coefficient of   i  -th and   j  -th ROIs are   W  (  k  ). Therefore, the sub-network under the   k  -th sub-time window is defined as \n\nwhere   C  (  k  ) represents the low-order DFCN of the subjects under the   k  -th sub-time window. In essence, DFCN reflect the temporal variability of functional connections between ROIs. \n\n\n\n### Construction of high-order functional connectivity network \n  \nTo capture high-order functional interactions across ROIs, the “correlation’s correlation” principle is adopted to obtain HFCN ( ;  ). Specifically, the FC series   between   i  -th and   j  -th ROIs for the   s  -th subject can be obtained from   C  (  k  )(see Eq. 3).   reflects the short time-dependent series of the correlation between   i  -th and   j  -th ROIs. Then the high-order connectivity for the   s  -th subject can be computed as  for each pair of FC series h  and  , where   corr   denotes PC coefficient. Thus,   H   can extract interaction information from up to four ROIs, whereas the correlation in Eq. 3 involves only two ROIs. This suggests that high-order connectivity can characterize more complex interactions. \n\nHowever, since the number of FC series is   N   × (  N −   1) / 2, the dimension of the high-order connectivity network grows exponentially with   N  , which will cause a large amount of computation complexity and the poor generalization performance. Therefore, the mean clustering algorithm ( ) is employed to group the FC series into different clusters. Specifically, the DFCN of all   S   subjects are stacked together in the following \n\nwhere   denotes the stacked sequence of all   K   sub-networks along the time for the   s  -th subject. Then FC of   i  -th and   j  -th ROIs is denoted by   for all   S   subjects. After that, the   N   ×   N   FC series in the stacked network are clustered into   U   clusters, and the corresponding average FC series of   U   clusters are calculated respectively as follows \n\nwhere Ω  denotes the set of the   u  -th cluster, and |Ω | denotes the number of elements in the set. Thus, the average FC series of the   s  -th subjects in the   u  -th cluster is obtained as \n\nIt is important to note that the size of   U   directly affects the difference of different clusters. In order to simulate the real high-order interaction of ROIs, we set the parameter   U   as one of {300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800}. The cluster parameter   U   will be automatically searched in subsequent experiments, and the effect will be given in the discussion section. Based on the average FC series obtained in Eq. 6, the high-order functional connectivity between the   u  -th cluster and the   v  -th cluster can be expressed as  . The HFCN can be defined as \n\nwhere   C   denotes the inter-modulation relationship between the functional connections of multiple ROIs, and reflects the spatial variability of the brain network. Furthermore, the HFCN obtained by “correlation’s correlation” strategy assumes that the functional brain network is fully connected. In order to better represent the real characteristics of the brain, we sparse the HFCN with percentage thresholding (edges with top λ % connection strength are retained) ( ). The high-order network thresholding parameter λ  range is {0:10:90}, which will be automatically searched in subsequent experiments, and the effect will be given in the discussion section. \n\n\n### Feature extraction and selection \n  \n#### Temporal variability feature extraction \n  \nTemporal variability is a measure that describes the degree to which the FC of a particular ROI to all other ROIs changes over time ( ). The temporal variability of   i  -th ROI can be expressed as \n\nwhere   w  (  k  ) = [  W  (  k  ),  W  (  k  ),⋯,  W  (  k  )]  ∈ ℝ  denotes FC under the   k  -th window between the   i  -th ROI and all other ROIs,   k   and   l   represent different time windows. The   denotes the average of PC coefficient in different time windows for   i  -th ROI. The   compares the functional architecture, i.e., overall functional connectivity profile associated with ROI   k   across different time windows. Then, a deduction from 1 indicates temporal variability of a ROI. In this way, it is possible to both target specific ROIs and assess the extent to which the functional architecture has changed over time at the global level. \n\n\n#### High-order network topology feature extraction \n  \nWe use the node degree and weighted-graph local clustering coefficient ( ) to extract features, separately. The node degree is the number of nodes directly connected to   i  -th node. The degree of the   i  -th node is defined as \n\nThe weighted-graph local clustering coefficient quantifies the probability that neighbors of this vertex are also connected to each other, which can better characterize the clique structure of the FCN. The weighted-graph local clustering coefficient   f   for vertex   i   can be defined as follows \n\nwhere   j   and   h   are the neighbor nodes of node   i  ,   r   is the number of neighbor nodes of node   i  , and   t   is the number of edges between all nodes connected to node   i  . The number of HFCN nodes depends on the number of clusters   U  , and the dimensions of the weighted-graph local clustering coefficient and node degree are both   U  . \n\n\n#### Feature selection \n  \nThe temporal variability extracted from DFCN is low-order features (  N   dimensional vectors), and the weighted-graph local clustering coefficient and node degree extracted from HFCN are high-order features (2  U   dimensional vectors). In order to remove irrelevant and redundant features for improving the generalization performance, Lasso regression algorithm ( ) is employed to find the most discriminative features relevant to SZ. \n\nFor considering the interaction among features, Lasso regression combines all features (with the dimension of   m   =   N   + 2  U  ) to select feature subsets and the involved ℓ -norm sparsity regularization is used to control the dimension of feature subsets. Lasso can be defined as \n\nwhere   Y   = [  y  ,  y  ,….,  y  ] ∈ ℝ  denotes the ground-truth label of the subjects (i.e., 1 for SZ, −1 for HC), and   F   ∈ ℝ  denotes a sparse dictionary that consists of the original feature matrix of   S   subjects and a column vector with all elements 1. α denotes the regression coefficient vector, and the position of its non-zero elements is the index of the selected feature in original feature set. λ  represents the penalty coefficient, which is used to control the sparsity of the feature subset. λ  is automatically searched in the experiments and its impact on model performance is given in the discussion section. \n\n\n\n\n## Experiments and results \n  \n### Experiment settings \n  \nAfter selecting important features with Lasso, the support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel is trained for SZ identification. There are four hyperparameters in our proposed model, including window length   L   (range of {20:10:70}), clustering number   U   (range of {300:100:800}), high-order network thresholding λ  (range of {0:10:90}), and Lasso feature selection parameter λ  (range of {0.1:0.1:0.6}). The nested leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) is used to evaluate classification performance and optimize those hyperparameters. Specifically, for   S   subjects in the dataset,   S  -1 subjects are used for training while the left-out one is used for testing. This procedure is repeated   S   times for evaluating the classification performance. To determine the optimal combination of the above four parameters, LOOCV is executed again on   S  -1 training subjects in the above process. Then, by applying the combination of optimal parameters on the   S  -1 different training subsets, we train   S  -1 classifiers to classify the test subject, and the final classification result is determined via majority voting. After repeating the above process   S   times, an overall cross-validation classification accuracy is calculated. \n\n\n### Evaluation methodology and results \n  \n#### Evaluation metrics \n  \nThe five metrics are employed to evaluate the performance, including accuracy (  ACC  ), sensitivity (  SEN  ), specificity (  SPE  ), area under curve (  AUC  ), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Those evaluation metrics can be defined as   ACC   = (  TP   +   TN  )/(  TP   +   FN   +   TN   +   FP  ),   SEN   =   TP  /(  TP   +   FN  ),   SPE   =   TN  /(  TN   +   FP  ), where   TP  ,   TN  ,   FP  , and   FN   are true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative, respectively. \n\n\n#### Method comparison \n  \nWe compare three methods with features extracted from SFCN, DFCN, and HFCN, respectively. The feature selection and classification procedures are same with our proposed method. Specifically, the upper triangular in static FC network (i.e., the matrix   W  ) is extracted and converted into a long vector. The vectors of all subjects are standardized and used as input to SVM after feature selection. Similarly, the temporal variability features and high-order features extracted from the low-order DFCN and the HFCN are separately used as the input of SVM after feature selection. The classification results are listed in   and the ROC curve is shown in  . \n  \nThe comparison of performance in the classification of SZs and HCs by different methods. \n    \nReceiver operating characteristic curves achieved by four different methods in SZ vs. HC classification. \n  \nIt can be seen from   that the performance of the static FC method is less than 70%. This may be because the SFCN only delineates the functional connectivity between paired ROIs throughout the scan, ignoring the dynamic functional interactions between multiple brain regions during the scan. The temporal variability method is improved by 3.3% compared to the static FC method. This illustrates the DFCN and temporal variability method of simulating the dynamic interaction of the brain by measuring the short-term correlation of brain regions, which is beneficial to the capture of discriminative features. Through the clustering of FC series and the calculation of high-order correlations, HFCN can further characterize the modulation relationship between FC of multiple ROIs, thereby characterizing the complex abstract interactions of the brain. Therefore, the high-order features (node degree and graph-weighted local clustering coefficients) extracted from HFCN can further improve the classification performance. Finally, the classification performance can be effectively improved by fusing low- and high-order features. This may be because temporal variability and high-order topological features describe properties between brain regions from different perspectives, indicating that the complementary information is critical for disease diagnosis. \n\n\n\n### Connectivity network analysis \n  \nOne participant is randomly selected to investigate the constructed connectivity network, shown in  . It can be seen from   that there is less difference between the brain network constructed by SFCN using the full time series and the averaged DFCN. This may be because both are essentially correlation measures for BOLD signals, while subtle differences may be the short-term FC properties obtained by DFCN. From  , it can be seen that measuring the correlation of BOLD signals at a fine-grained level can effectively reflect the dynamic functional interaction of ROIs. It is worth noting that the FC intensity varied significantly throughout the scanning phase. This change is reflected in spatially and temporally, that is, the FC has undergone interactive reorganization in different ROIs, which changes the modular structure of the brain network.   shows that network topology in the HFCN is more complex, implying it containing more high-order ROI’s interaction. \n  \nVisualization of SFCN, DFCN, and HFCN when the window length   L   = 40.

(F,G)   The average of the sub-networks under whole time windows of DFCN and the static FC network based on pair-wise correlation of BOLD signals, respectively.   (H)   The constructed high-order FC network. \n  \nFurthermore, we investigate the connectivity differences in the HFCN of SZ and HC from both individual and group perspectives. From  , it can be seen that the high-order functional connectivity of HC is overall higher than that of SZ, which is consistent with the existing researches on lower-order brain networks ( ;  ). This illustrates that there is a wide range of functional disconnections in SZ patients ( ). This disconnection is manifested in complex functional interactions across multiple ROIs ( ), leading to abnormalities in the functional separation and integration characteristics of SZ. \n  \nVisualization of HFCN for SZ and HC (  L   = 40,   U   = 600, λ    = 0.5).

(B)   The averaged HFCN and local details of SZ and HC groups. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Model parameter sensitivity analysis \n  \nTo further analyze the influence of different parameters on the classification results, the classification performance under different window   L  , different cluster   U  , as well as different parameter combinations are discussed. \n\n#### The effect of   L   and   U   on the performance \n  \nWe fix   L   at one of {20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70}, and use nested LOOCV to optimize several other parameter combinations to analyze the effect of   L   on model performance. It can be seen from   that   ACC   first increases and then decreases with   L  , and reaches the highest when   L   = 40. This indicates that the size of the   L   is important for the detection of dynamic interactions between ROIs. A smaller window length can capture shorter-term functional changes, but is more susceptible to noise. A larger window length would make the performance more stable, but the dynamic information cannot be effectively detected. This is consistent with previous research ( ). In addition, when the   L   becomes large, the length of the FC series decreases, which may lead to a decrease in the reliability of HFCN. The choice of cluster number   U   also has a greater impact on the classification results. As shown in  , the impact of   U   on performance is analyzed by fixing the number of clusters   U   to be one of {300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800}. It can be seen that   ACC   is more sensitive to changes in the number of clusters, and the highest   ACC   can be obtained when   U   is 600. \n  \nThe effect of different parameters on classification performance.   (A)   The different window length   L  ;   (B)   the different cluster number   U  . \n  \nThe clustering algorithm can reduce the dimension of HFCN and effectively decrease the computational complexity as well as the redundant features. The FC series of some ROI pairs are depicted in  . For many ROI pairs, their temporal correlations are significantly different, such as the FC strength and change trend. From  , it can be seen that the functional connectivity order of three clusters has a consistent change trend within the cluster, but has a significantly different change trend among the clusters. The clustering algorithm is able to find the underlying dominant dynamic patterns in all FC sequences. \n  \nSome selected FC series and their clustering results (  L   = 40,   U   = 600).   (A)   The original FC series.   (B)   Red, green, and blue indicate three different clusters.   (C)   The averaged FC series of the three clusters, separately. \n  \n\n#### The effect of different parameter combinations on the performance \n  \nTo further analyze the impact of different parameter combinations on the performance, we conduct an additional LOOCV experiment, and the accuracy under different combinations of parameters (  L  ,   U  , λ ) with HFCN threshold parameter λ  = 0.5 is shown in  . It can be seen that when   L   = 40 and   U   = 600, the accuracy is generally higher, which is consistent with the previous results when   L   and   U   are analyzed separately. In addition, the Lasso feature selection parameter λ  has a greater impact on the classification results. When λ  is set to a small value (0.1–0.3), high classification performance can be obtained. This is because λ  controls the number of features in the feature selection process. When λ  is too large, some discriminative features are discarded together with redundant features, which may be detrimental to the classification performance. \n  \nStatistical classification accuracy is estimated by our proposed method with different values of hyperparameters. For clear visualization, HFCN thresholding parameter λ  is set to 0.5. These results are obtained by LOOCV on whole data. \n  \n\n\n### Most discriminative features \n  \nTo find out the discriminative features or clusters for SZ identification, we fix the number of clusters   U   at 600 and analyze the importance of each feature in the classification. Specifically, during the feature selection process in each validation step, the selected features for classification might be different for different training datasets. We count the total weight of each feature in all training and classification, and use it to measure the classification contribution of features, as shown in  . It can be seen that only a few features have a large weight, indicating that they are the discriminative features for classification. Furthermore, most of the features with large weight belong to the time variability features and node degree features of high-order network, which reveals that these two kinds of features play a more important role in SZ diagnosis. \n  \nThe normalized classification weights of all features (  U   = 600). \n  \nTo further find the most important classification features, we conduct a separate analysis of time variability features and high-order features. For the time variability features, we take the absolute value of the normalized feature weights and sort them.   lists the brain regions corresponding to the top ten features with large weights. We can see that the brain regions with highest contribution including the   frontal lobes  ,   Cerebellum7bR  ,   Vermis7  , and   limbic system  , which are visualized in  . These regions have been suggested to be related to SZ by previous studies ( ;  ;  ). \n  \nBrain regions corresponding to the 10 time variability features with large weights. \n    \nThe projections of ROIs corresponding to the ten time variability features with the large weights on the cortical surface. \n  \nFor high-order features, we add the feature weights of the node degree and the weighted-graph local clustering coefficient of HFCN in classification to obtain the importance of a certain cluster. The five most important clusters are filtered out for classification and presented in the form of a chord diagram, as shown in  . It can be seen that the five clusters with the largest weights involve 58 functional connections and 21 brain regions (20 mirrored brain regions of both hemispheres among them). Five brain regions are consistent with   and  , including the   insular inferior frontal gyrus  ,   paracentral lobule  ,   retroorbital gyrus  ,   supplementary motor area  , and   cerebellum7b  .   shows the related FC within the five clusters. It can be seen that these functional connections mainly involve the   frontal lobe  ,   parietal lobe  , and   cerebellum  . Among them, the frontal lobe-cerebellar and the parietal lobe-cerebellar connection are more numerous and weighted.   shows the specific top twenty clusters with the highest classification weights. It can be seen that the   cerebellum   and   frontal lobes   still have constant importance in these top clusters. In addition, the visual network regions of the   occipital lobe  , such as the fusiform gyrus and the cortex around the talar fissure are also of greater importance for the diagnosis of SZ. \n  \nFunctional connectivity contained in the five clusters with the largest classification weights. Each node in the figure represents a ROI, and the line between the two nodes represents functional connectivity. The functional connections contained in different clusters are shown in different colors, and the importance increases sequentially from Cluster 5 to Cluster 1. \n    \nThe most discriminative connections and brain regions in the whole brain view. The size of a node, calculated from the total weight of all clusters that containing the node, indicates the importance of the node during the classification. The thickness of the edge represents the classification weight of the cluster that connects the edge. \n    \nThe top 20 clusters with the highest classification weight. The functional subnetworks represented by different colors are the same as in  . \n  \nIn this article, cerebellum (especially   Cerebelum7bR  ) and   frontal lobe  -related features play the most important roles in SZ classification, which confirmed by features extracted from both DFCN and HFCN. In fact, abnormalities in the cerebellum and   frontal lobe   of patients with SZ have been identified in other studies ( ;  ). For example,   found that SZ patients showed dysfunction of the prefrontal-thalamic-cerebellar circuit, and proposed the Cognitive Dysmetria hypothesis ( ), which believed that abnormalities in the neural circuits connecting the thalamus and cerebellum may lead to abnormalities in cognitive control, coordination and affective aspects. This may be the underlying psychopathological cause of the complex symptoms of SZ. Functionally, the   frontal lobe   is involved in attention regulation, abstract rules, social behavior, etc., and is also linked to the symptoms of SZ. In terms of the cerebellum, it is not only mainly responsible for the function of motor control but also has been reported in the research of SZ that there are abnormalities of neural circuits between it and other cortex ( ;  ). In addition, the striatum and multiple regions of the parietal-premotor cortex (  paracentral lobule  ,   postcentral gyrus  ,   precuneus  ,   supramarginal gyrus  ,   inferior parietal gyrus  , and   superior parietal gyrus  ) also show important roles in SZ classification ( ). The striatum has been a key region in the study of SZ, and has an important relationship with the dopamine hypothesis of the etiology of SZ ( ). Many antipsychotic drugs rely on blockade of dopamine receptors in the striatum ( ). In the AAL2 template, the striatum is divided into three brain regions:   caudate nucleus  ,   putamen  , and   pallidum  , two of which appear in the five clusters with the largest classification weight and show abnormal connectivity to the   orbitofrontal cortex  . The   paracentral lobules  ,   postcentral gyrus  , and other brain regions of the parietal-premotor cortex are mainly involved in sensory-motor, spatial attention, etc. Abnormalities in these brain areas may explain the sensory, thinking and behavioral disorders in SZ. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this article, we propose a temporal-spatial dynamic functional connectivity analysis method that combines DFCN and HFCN for SZ diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct a DFCN and extract temporal variability features that reflect temporal dynamic information. Based on DFCN, the HFCN is constructed by means of clustering algorithm and “correlation’s correlation” strategy, and the node degree and graph-weighted local clustering coefficient features of the sparse HFCN are extracted. Then, the most discriminatory features are selected with Lasso method for SZ classification. The proposed method is verified on a real SZ dataset and demonstrates promising performance via comparison with the competitive brain network analysis methods. The abnormal brain regions detected in this paper can provide a direction for more detailed research on the pathology of SZ and the search for biological markers in the future. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

The cerebellum has been implicated as playing a role in cognitive processes. However, functional connectivity (FC) among cognitive sub-regions of the cerebellum in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains to be further elucidated. \n\n Objective:   Our study aims to investigate the FC changes of the cerebellum among patients with AD and MCI, compared to healthy controls (HC). Additionally, we explored the role of cerebellum FC changes in the cognitive performance of all subjects. \n\n Materials:   Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from three different groups (28 AD patients, 26 MCI patients, and 30 HC) was collected. We defined cerebellar crus II and lobule IX as seed regions to assess the intragroup differences of cortico-cerebellar connectivity. Bias correlational analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between changes in FC and neuropsychological performance. \n\n Results:   Compared to HC, AD patients had decreased FC within the caudate, limbic lobe, medial frontal gyrus (MFG), middle temporal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, parietal lobe/precuneus, inferior temporal gyrus, and posterior cingulate gyrus. Interestingly, MCI patients demonstrated increased FC within inferior parietal lobe, and MFG, while they had decreased FC in the thalamus, inferior frontal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus. Further analysis indicated that FC changes between the left crus II and the right thalamus, as well as between left lobule IX and the right parietal lobe, were both associated with cognitive decline in AD. Disrupted FC between left crus II and right thalamus, as well as between left lobule IX and right parietal lobe, was associated with attention deficit among subjects with MCI. \n\n Conclusion:   These findings indicate that cortico-cerebellar FC in MCI and AD patients was significantly disrupted with different distributions, particularly in the default mode networks (DMN) and fronto-parietal networks (FPN) region. Increased activity within the fronto-parietal areas of MCI patients indicated a possible compensatory role for the cerebellum in cognitive impairment. Therefore, alterations in the cortico-cerebellar FC represent a novel approach for early diagnosis and a potential therapeutic target for early intervention. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative dementia, is characterized by a progressive deterioration of cognitive functions, as well as changes in behavior and personality ( ,  ). Amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has been recognized as a transition stage between normal cognitive function and AD-type dementia, which has a chance of progression to AD up to 25% per year ( ). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is reflecting the synchronization of functional activity between distant brain regions by observing the brain low frequency fluctuations in the blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which is widely used in diagnosis and predict the disease progression of AD ( – ). The application of resting-state fMRI techniques has revealed imaging features of AD with regards to brain structure ( ,  ). Studies have shown that functional connections and brain networks are impaired as early as the aMCI stage ( ). In the preclinical stage of AD, the hippocampus, visual cortex and frontal lobe have been decoupled, and the enhanced connections between the middle cingulate gyrus (MCC), the precuneus gyrus (PCU), the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC), and the cerebellum are the internal mechanisms of ad functional compensation. After entering MCI stage, PCU can no longer compensate for the decompensation of AD susceptible areas such as hippocampus, but the connection between cerebellum, MCC and PCC is enhanced, which can be maintained until dementia stage ( ,  ). AD progression can be delayed via early diagnosis and intervention. Resting state fMRI can be more sensitive to explore the brain network changes of early AD ( ,  ). Previous studies have focused on the cerebral cortex, and less research has been focused on the role of the cerebellum in cognitive regulation of the AD spectrum ( ,  ). \n\nRecent studies have implicated the role of cerebellum in cognitive processes ( – ). Cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) is characterized by executive dysfunction, spatial cognitive impairment, language deficits, and personality changes ( – ). The human cerebellar cortex is a complicated structure, as the surface of it is more tightly folded than the cerebral cortex, and has almost 80% of the surface area of the neocortex, and the nerve fiber connections to the brain's cognitive network is extensive ( ), indicating that the cerebellum plays an important role in the evolution of behavior and cognition. Furthermore, the cerebellar lobular volumes, as well as the cortico-cerebellar FC, was found to decrease with age, leading to cognitive decline among the healthy elderly people ( ,  ). Previous studies have suggested that the cerebellum is a survivor of preclinical AD stage process and remains virtually unaffected ( ,  ). However, recent studies have found that as the disease progresses, the structure, as well as the function of the cerebellum also changes ( ). \n\nWith the progression of AD, the cerebellar gray matter volume changes in a continuum with posterior-to-anterior cerebellar lobe development. The vermis and paravermian lobes of anterior lobe (I-V) and posterior lobe (VI) were mainly involved in aMCI, and the hemispheric part of posterior lobe (VI lobule) and Crus I were involved in AD. GM atrophy of Crus I will cause functional damage, which becomes more obvious with the increase of disease severity ( ). Another study shows that the FC between the dentate nucleus (DN) and lateral temporal regions was increased in AD patients compared to controls, when using cerebellar DN as a region of interest, which suggests that FC changes within specific cerebellar-cortical functional modules is involved in cognitive impairment among AD patients ( ). The DN is involved in planning and execution of random movements, as well as higher cognitive and sensory processing. It is also a key area involved in integration and regulating cerebral-cerebellar networks. The dorsolateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex is involved in working memory, decision-making, time processing, and other cognitive functions ( ). After an injection of a trans-neuronal retrograde tracer to the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe, a small number of Purkinje cells were labeled in the lateral region of Crus II ( ) (along with Crus I, a hemispheric extension of lobule VIIa), as well as in the normal portions of lobule X and lobule VII. This suggests the existence of a “cognitive” loop between dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and specific cerebellar cortical areas ( ). \n\nAn increasing number of imaging studies have confirmed that cerebellar Crus II and lobular IX are associated with cognitive networks ( ,  ,  ), particularly with the default mode network (DMN) and fronto-parietal network (FPN) ( – ). The anterior cerebellum and lobule VIII are associated with movement, whereas the posterior cerebellum (i.e., lobule VI-Crus I, lobule Crus II-VIIB, and lobule IX) are critical for cognitive representation ( – ). Lobule VI, VIIB, and Crus I are specifically involved in executive functions, including working memory, planning, organizing, and strategy formation, all of which are important for creative divergent thinking ( – ). Visual divergent thinking is an approach to a situation or concept that focuses on exploring as many aspects of the visual concept as possible, and it is a primary component of fields such as photography, drawing, architecture and sculpture, which is significantly associated with activity in the left lobule VI, VIIB, Crus I, and Crus II, and is associated with executive function ( ). Previous studies have established that working memory task processing and front-oparietal network connectivity simultaneously engaged lobule VI/Crus I, Crus II/lobule VIIB, and lobule IX with the DMN ( ,  ,  ). Bai et al. used a resting-state fMRI to explore spontaneous activation of the cerebellum and found significant differences in lobule IX and Crus II in the posterior cerebellum of aMCI patients compared to controls ( ). Therefore, bilateral Crus II and lobule IX were chosen herein as regions of interest to study FC characteristics of the cerebellum in patients with aMCI and AD. \n\nHowever, the characteristics and differences of cerebellar FC in MCI and AD patients remains unknown. This present study was conducted to analyze alterations in cerebellar-cortical FC and whether these alterations were associated with clinical cognitive impairment in MCI and AD patients. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAll study subjects were recruited from the Nanjing Brain Hospital between June 2018 to October 2020. All subjects were right-handed, and included 27 AD subjects (11 males and 16 females), 25 MCI subjects (9 males and 16 females), and 13 healthy controls were not different statistically in terms of age and sex (7 males and 6 females). The diagnosis of AD and MCI was carried out according to the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association working group (NIA-A) in 2011 ( ,  ). All patients underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessment, MRI scans, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The inclusion criteria for health controls (HC) included (1) no current cognitive issues, (2) no neurological or psychiatric diseases, and (3) a clinical dementia rating (CDR) score of 0 ( ). Exclusion criteria for both groups included (1) other known causes of dementia (i.e., frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, vascular dementia, severe depression, cerebrovascular disease, tumors, poisoning, metabolic diseases, and infections), and (2) contraindications to undergoing an MRI, such as claustrophobia or pacemaker implantation. \n\nAll participants provided a written informed consent and the study was granted approval by the Medical Research Ethical Committee of Nanjing Brain Hospital in Nanjing, China. \n\n\n### Clinical and Neuropsychological Assessments \n  \nAll participants underwent comprehensive and standard neuropsychological assessments in order to evaluate their cognitive function. Global cognition was evaluated using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) ( ), the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) ( ), and the CDR ( ). Episodic memory was assessed using the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) ( ). Visuospatial abilities were evaluated with the clock-drawing test (CDT) ( ). Language function was determined using the Boston naming test (BNT) and the verbal fluency test (VFT-animals). Executive function was assessed using part A and B of the trail making test (TMT), as well as the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). Verbal working memory was determined using the digit span test (DST) ( ). The emotional condition of the subjects were determined using the Hamilton Depression (HAMD) ( ). These scales were validated by senior neuropsychologists and evaluated by experienced clinicians. \n\n\n### Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers \n  \nCSF Aβ1–42, t-tau, and p-tau were measured using INNOBIA AlzBio3 immunoassay kit-based reagents (Innotest, Fujirebio, Ghent, Belgium). Notably, not all participants had CSF sample data since lumbar puncture is an invasive operation. In this study, 25AD subjects and 27 MCI subjects had CSF sample data available. \n\n#### Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Acquisition \n  \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired utilizing a Siemens 3.0 T singer scanner (Siemens, Verio, Germany) with an 8-channel radio frequency coil at the Affiliated Brain Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Participants were asked to remain as still as possible, close their eyes, remain awake, and to not think of anything. T1WI was acquired through application of a three-dimensional magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (3D-MPRAGE). The parameters included time repetition (TR) = 1,900 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.48 ms, inversion time (TI) = 900 ms, number of slices = 176, thickness = 1.0 mm, gap = 0.5 mm, matrix = 256 × 256, flip angle (FA) = 9?, field of view (FOV) = 256 × 256 mm, and voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm . Resting-state fMRI acquisition was applied using single echo planar imaging (EPI). The gradient echo-echo planar imaging (GRE-EPI) sequence included 240 time points. TE = 30 ms; TR = 2,000 ms; number of slices = 36, FOV = 220 × 220 mm ; matrix = 64 × 64; FA = 90°; thickness = 4.0 mm, gap = 0 mm. The imaging for each subject took ~ 14 min. \n\n\n#### Data Preprocessing \n  \nThe fMRI data were processed using the Data Processing and Analysis for Brain Imaging (DPABI,  ) ( ). The first 10 volumes of the rest session were discarded for each subject. The remaining images were corrected utilizing slice timing and motion (head motion ≤ 3 mm, head motion angle ≤ 3°). Next, resting-state fMRI images were co-registered to high-resolution 3D-T1 structural images. Normalization of 3D-T1 structural MRI images to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space was undertaken via non-linear warping based on Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL). After spatial normalization to T1 space, all images were resampled into 3 × 3 × 3 mm  voxels and spatially smoothed using a Gaussian filter of 6 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). Data was then temporally band-pass-filtered (0.01–0.08 Hz) in order to eliminate low-frequency drifts and physiological high-frequency noise. Furthermore, to reduce the confounding artifacts of resting head movements and physiological noise (respiration and cardiac fluctuations), nuisance covariates were regressed out, including the Friston 24-motion parameter model, global mean, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid signals. \n\n\n#### Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nThe bilateral cerebellar Crus II and lobule IX were extracted as regions of interest (ROI) utilizing the DPABI software package template (anatomical automatic labeling, AAL) in order to localize the two ROIs, respectively ( ). \n  \nThe ROIs of the cerebellum. The image was transformed into the space of the SUIT atlas and was overlapped by the seeds. Red color represents the Crus II, and blue color represents the posterior lobule IX. \n  \nFC analysis was performed between each seed region, as well as the whole brain, in a voxel-wise manner using the DPABI software. The voxels of each seed region of every subject were extracted and averaged in order to obtain the reference time series of seed points. Then, we calculated the correlation coefficient between the reference time series and the time series involving all other brain voxels. The correlation coefficients were transformed into   z  -values using the Fisher   r  -to-  z   transformation, leading to an improvement in normality. \n\n\n#### Statistical Analysis \n  \nAll data was tested for normality and variance congruence. Normally distributed data was expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The ANOVA and chi-square test were performed to compare the demographic and neurocognitive data among the groups (AD, MCI, and HC). Bonferroni correction was used for   post-hoc   comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 25.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). A two-sided   P   < 0.05 represented statistical significance. \n\nIn order to determine the differences of whole-brain resting-state FC of each cerebellar seed region, we conducted statistical analyses across the three groups was conducted utilizing ANOVA, with age, sex, years of education, and gray matter volume used as covariates. Gray matter volume sequence was extracted by REST Toolkit ( ). The multiple comparisons of ANOVA results were corrected using AlphaSim with a significance threshold of   P   < 0.05 (cluster size > 100 voxels, and voxel-level   P   < 0.05; determined by a Monte Carlo simulation).   Post-hoc   two-sample   t   tests were corrected by Bonferroni.   P   < 0.05 was statistically significant. \n\nThen, partial bias correlation analysis was utilized to explore the relationship between resting-state FC among different brain regions with the clinical neuropsychological score, using gender, age, and education level as covariates (  P   < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Characteristics \n  \nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of each participant are indicated in  . There were no significant differences with regards to age, gender, or education among the three groups. In contrast, there were significant differences for each cognitive domain. Overall cognitive levels, episodic memory ability, executive ability, verbal ability, and visuospatial function were significantly lower in the AD group compared to both the MCI and HC group. There was also a significant decrease in the above cognitive domains in the MCI group compared to the HC group (  p   < 0.001). \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the participants. \n  \n MMSE, Mini-Mental State Examination; MoCA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment; HAMD, Hamilton Depression Scale; AVLT, Auditory Verbal Learning Test; CDT, Clock Drawing Test; SDMT, Symbol Digit Modalities Test; DST, Digit Span Test; BNT, Boston Naming Test; VFT, Verbal Fluency Task; TMT, Trail-Making Test  . \n  \n\n### Functional Connectivity \n  \n#### Functional Connectivity Changes of the Left Crus II \n  \nUsing left crus II as the ROI, whole-brain FC analysis revealed that FC values of the right caudate (CAU), left limbic lobe (LIM), and right medial frontal gyrus (MFG) were reduced in AD patients compared to HC. Furthermore, FC with left thalamus (THAL) was decreased in the MCI group, but increased in the right cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL) compared to the HC group.

We also explored the relevance of this change to cognitive function. Firstly, we found that after adjusting for age, gender, education level and gray matter volume, FC changed brain regions were distributed in temporal region and front-oparietal lobe region, which were important brain regions of DMN and FPN, respectively. Secondly, we identified that FC changes was associated with impaired cognitive function, especially in attention, executive, and memory tasks. \n\nThe current research indicates that there are significant changes with regards to the FC of cerebellar cognitive subregions within the AD and MCI groups. Compared to the HC group, FC in frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and parietal lobe were decreased in AD group. Interestingly, the FC between cerebellum and superior frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus in the MCI group was partially weakened, while some connections in the middle frontal gyrus and parietal lobe were strengthened. The research on brain functional connections of AD is now a hot topic, but there are a few studies that have evaluated the effect of the cerebellum on cognitive function connections. \n\n### Functional Connectivity Changes in the AD Patients \n  \nIn the present study, decreased FC in the AD group were mainly in frontal, temporal, parietal and precuneus cortex, which were closely related to DMN and FPN ( ). \n\nIt was found in other longitudinal studies that the evolution of AD spectrum is characterized by progressive loss of functional connectivity in the neocortical association area ( ,  ). Compared with HC subjects, the hyper connection found in MCI subjects may be a compensation mechanism for the low efficiency of memory network, especially in the temporoparietal region ( ,  ). Previous studies have found that the prefrontal and temporoparietal connectivity of MCI patients is stronger than that of normal people ( ,  ), With the progression of the disease, the connectivity is weakened in AD ( ,  ,  ). \n\nFurthermore, a strong relationship between DMN, lobule IX, and crus II have been reported previously ( ,  ,  ,  ). DMN is a brain resting network that is activated when individuals are not engaged in attending to or responding to external stimuli, and is involved in regulating self-reflection and memory processes ( – ). The DMN network, which consists of the PCUN/PCC, medial prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal and parietal cortices and hippocampus, has been proposed to be the most vulnerable brain network in patients with AD ( ,  ,  ). Thus, it can be inferred that diminished cerebellar connectivity to the DMN network in AD patients may be one of the causes involved in cognitive impairment. FPN is a network that is involved in attention and working memory function and consists of lateral prefrontal and parietal cortex. It has also been reported that the FPN is remarkably impaired in AD patients, as reported herein ( ,  ). \n\nIt is important to note that compared to HC, the connections between cognitive subregions of the cerebellum and the limbic lobe were significantly reduced in AD patients. This result is consistent with a recent study that reported that FC in the cerebellar-limbic network was significantly more vulnerable in AD patients compared to aMCI patients ( ). \n\n\n### Functional Connectivity Changes in the MCI Patients \n  \nIn comparison to HC, patients with MCI show right cerebellar crus II hyper-connectivity with bilateral IPL and MFG, which is functionally associated with FPN. Moreover, the FC between the cerebellum and thalamus, superior frontal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus were decreased in MCI patients. \n\nPrevious studies have shown that there is less structural and pathological damage at the aMCI stage ( ). It has also been reported that increased cerebellar activity was positively correlated with memory enhancement, and served as a compensatory process ( ). Thus, we can speculate that an increase in connectivity here may underline some of the compensatory mechanism of the cerebellum for sites of weakened connectivity. \n\nWhile the FC in IPL sites were impaired in AD patients, they were actually enhanced in aMCI patients, suggesting that enhanced connectivity between the cerebellum and IPL in preclinical AD may have functional compensatory mechanisms ( ). The IPL is an important node in DMN and FPN, and is considered a heterogeneous brain area with functions in episodic memory, semantic processing, and spatial cognition ( ,  ). Consistent with our results, hyperactivity in the inferior and superior parietal lobes in MCI patients has been reported within the present study ( ). Therefore, these findings indicate that IPL may be one of the brain areas responsible for episodic memory. It is worth noting that the aMCI group showed increased FC between the cerebellum and IPL in the DMN, while it was decreased in the AD group, compared to the HC group. This proves that changes in FC may serve as markers for identifying patients with AD and aMCI. \n\nIn the present study, decreased FC between the cerebellum and MFG is indicated in AD patients. However, the FC between the right-sided lobule IX and MFG was significantly increased in MCI patients, which may compensate for the impaired memory that is often seen in MCI patients. Previous studies have indicated that decreased DMN connectivity is associated with increased prefrontal connectivity and that this increased connectivity may be a compensatory effect on cognition of the prefrontal lobes ( ,  ). In addition, some studies found that FC increased in anterior DMN and FC decreased in posterior DMN; The increase of FC in anterior DMN is considered to be a compensatory increase of cognitive function to maintain task performance ( ,  ). \n\nHypo-connectivity between the cerebellum crus II, lobule IX, and THAL was also investigated in the present study. The cerebellum is involved in cognitive processes through cerebellum-thalamo-cortical pathways to cognitive functions regions, including the prefrontal and parietal cortices, and the cingulate and para-hippocampal gyri ( ,  ). The thalamic nuclei are important intermediate stations in the cerebrocerebellar feedback limb of the cerebrocerebellar circuit ( ). It is significant for the cerebellum-thalamo-cortical, and cortical-ponto-cerebellar pathways to modulate cognitively-relevant prefrontal and parietal activities ( ). Therefore, reduced connectivity between cerebellum and thalamus in AD patients may directly interrupt the connectivity of the cerebellum to cognitive networks, including the DMN and the limbic lobe network, which leads to cognitive impairment. \n\nFurther correlation analysis with clinical score revealed that compensation and decompensation in AD and MCI patients were clinically distinguishable. The FC values between the right crus II and the left SFG were positively correlated with DST scores in MCI patients, while the resting-state FC values between the right crus II and the right THAL were negatively correlated with MOCA scores in AD patients. These results indicate that remarkable changes occur in the attentive networks involving lobule VI, crus I, and crus II, implying a fundamental role for these cerebellar areas in attention ( ). FC between the cerebellum and fronto-parietal cortex was proposed to be strongly associated with magnitude of cerebellar activation through working memory and attention ( ). No correlation with HDAS was found in this study, which may be due to the limited range of the dependent variable in our cohort, which has been added to the revised comments. \n\nWe also correlated signals that were extracted from areas of significant FC with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, including Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40/Aβ1-42, t-tau, and p-tau, which be used as one of the differentiations and diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease ( ). However, no statistically significant difference was identified. \n\nDi Lorenzo et al. used the neurophysiological method of short latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and found that stimulating the cerebellum θ Wave group (TBS) can activate cerebello thalamic cortical pathway and regulate central cholinergic function ( ). In subsequent study, they used repetitive and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with different degrees of AD and were followed up for 3 years. The results showed that the loss of LTP like cortical plasticity in AD patients was more severe than that in MCI patients ( ). After the study of cerebellum iTBS, they found that the plasticity mechanism of cerebellum cortex was damaged in Alzheimer disease ( ). A previous study that applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) (a non-invasive stimulus in which cTBS can inhibits brain excitability) to the lateral part of the cerebellum found that FC between the frontal and parietal cognitive areas was significantly attenuated, while FC between cTBS and motor areas remained unchanged ( ). This also proves that cerebellar TBS can promote the reorganization of cerebellar cortex and has a potential role in improving motor and learning ( ). The results of this study demonstrate the role of the cerebellum in AD progression and pathogenesis, and provide a novel target for non-pharmacological interventions. Our findings are able to help explain the mechanism by which non-invasive stimulation improves cognitive impairment in AD, and provides new targets and ideas for non-pharmacological interventions. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThere were three major limitations of this study that need to be addressed in the future. Firstly, some patients with ad also have emotional symptoms. The relationship between cerebellum and emotion has been confirmed. Therefore, in the next study, we will add CCAS scale to evaluate more comprehensively. Secondly, in this study, the result of cluster sizes was relatively small, it may be related to the small sample size. We will continue to increase the sample size in the follow-up study. Thirdly, the study was a cross-sectional study, longitudinal studies are needed in the future to study the dynamic changes of cerebellum in the development of AD. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, FC between the cerebellar and other cognitively relevant sub-regions was found to be significantly reduced in AD patients. In MCI patients, the FC between the cerebellum and cortex, including the superior and inferior frontal gyri, was also disrupted. On the other hand, the FC between the cerebellum and the middle frontal gyrus, as well as the parietal regions, was enhanced. These results suggest that MCI may be in the preclinical stage of structural damage and functional compensation of AD, and is associated with cognitive function. And the FC changes in specific cerebello-cortical functional modules may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Medical Research Ethical Committee of Nanjing Brain Hospital in Nanjing, China.

In the current study, we hypothesized that the topographical organization along with its temporal dynamics of the autistic brain measured by temporal mean and variance of complex network measures, respectively, were significantly altered, which may further explain the autistic symptom severity in patients with ASD. To validate these hypotheses, the precise FCs between DMN regions at each time point were calculated using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) project. Then, the minimal spanning tree (MST) technique was applied to construct a time-varying complex network of DMN. By analyzing the temporal mean and variance of MST parameters and their relationship with autistic symptom severity, we found that in persons with ASD, the information exchange efficiencies between cortical regions within DMN were significantly lower and more volatile compared with those in typical developing participants. Moreover, these alterations within DMN were closely associated with the autistic symptom severity of the ASD group. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) describes a group of neurodevelopmental disorders, which could impair social communication ability and lead to restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors or interests ( ). The prevalence rate of ASD has increased drastically in recent years world over and ASD has become one of the global public health problems affecting human mental health seriously ( ,  ). Thus, it is imperative to elaborate on the pathological mechanisms and potential risk factors related to ASD and develop efficient therapies. \n\nWith the recent development of modern neuroimaging techniques, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the exploration of the neuropathological of ASD has become possible. The functional connectivity revealed by temporal dependency between functional signals of distinct cortical regions could provide a possible explanatory framework for ASD ( ). A theory of cortical hypoconnectivity in the autistic brain predicts that the interregional collaboration and information exchange required both in cognitive tasks and task-free resting-state (RS) would be underserved in ASD ( ,  ). This theory has been supported by numerous neuroimaging studies, although cortical hyperconnectivity has also been detected in some studies ( ,  ). Among all these functional connectivity studies, the hypoconnectivity involving regions of the default mode network (DMN) which are crucial to the normal development of social cognition abilities (e.g., self-representation, mentalizing ability, and emotion recognition) has been consistently observed in previous studies ( ,  ). By representing the brain as a complex network with a set of nodes (i.e., cortical regions/scalp channels) connected by edges (i.e., neural connectivity), one can study its topographical organization by using concepts from graph theory to evaluate various graph parameters ( ). Related research shows that the node-level and network-level complex network parameters are significantly altered in patients with ASD and could predict their autistic symptom severity, which suggested that the topographical configuration of the cortical network within the autistic brain tends to deviate from the optimal network organization ( ,  ). \n\nHowever, previous studies focusing on neural connectivity and topographical organizations between cortical regions of persons with ASD had certain limitations. For example, the widely used static functional connectivity techniques are too simplistic to elaborate all the temporal-spatial information of cortical activities, since previous research proved that temporal coupling between cortical regions fluctuated over time, even during task-free resting-state (RS) ( ). In Jia et al. ( ), the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC), which could assess the dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) between cortical regions and is a technique with high test-retest reliability, was applied to investigate the DMN-FC (i.e., the functional connectivity between DMN regions) patterns of persons with ASD. They showed that compared to the typical developing (TD) group, the ASD group exhibited a significantly lower temporal mean of DMN-FC and significantly higher temporal variance of DMN-FC. In our study, we intend to examine the topographical properties of the time-varying complex brain network of persons with ASD through the DCC technique and minimal spanning tree (MST) using the resting-state fMRI datasets of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), which includes functional and structural brain imaging datasets of more than 1,000 participants ( ). The MST is a unique acyclic subgraph that contains the strongest connections from the set of all available weighted connections ( ). As a network construction technique, one of the excellent features of the MST approach is that MST is unaffected by the thresholding problem ( ). Moreover, recent studies have shown that MST analysis is effective and sensitive to capturing alterations of the topographical organization due to group differences and conditional effects in both functional and structural imaging datasets ( ,  ,  ). We hypothesized that compared to TD participants, persons with ASD should exhibit significantly altered topographical organization measured by temporal mean and variance of MST parameters. Moreover, these abnormalities should be significantly associated with the autistic symptom severity in the ASD group. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### The resting-state FMRI datasets \n  \nThe ABIDE project includes the resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) datasets, MRI datasets, and phenotypic information (including gender, age at fMRI scan, sex, IQ, and diagnostic information) of 1,112 participants (539 persons with ASD and 573 TD participants recorded by 17 institutions (so-called “  sites  ”) ( ). The data collection were conducted following the basic principles of the Helsinki declaration and were approved by the research ethics committees of these institutions. Informed consent was obtained from the participants or their legal guardians. Details of acquisition and experimental protocols of all the sites are available at  . \n\nThe RS-fMRI datasets of 343 persons with ASD and 428 TD participants were selected for the complex network analysis. The dataset selection was performed according to the following criteria: (1) datasets with MRI images providing near-full brain coverage and successful registration; (2) datasets passing manual quality assessments of three independent raters; (3) datasets with mean framewise displacement (  func_mean_fd  ) < 0.2 mm; (4) datasets with percent framewise displacement >0.2 mm (  func_perc_fd  ) < 25%; (5) individuals with IQ score >75; (6) individuals in ASD group with reliable diagnostic information obtained   via   Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS) or Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R); (7) datasets from sites with more than three participants in each group after selecting datasets based on the above six criteria ( ). \n\nThe independent   t  -tests with groups (ASD group vs. TD group) as the independent variable and phenotypic information (i.e., age at fMRI scan and IQ) and image parameters (i.e., func_mean_fd and func_perc_fd) as dependent variables did not detect any significant group difference (  ps   > 0.05). For more information on the demographic data of these participants, see  . \n\n\n### Resting-state FMRI datasets preprocessing \n  \nIn this study, the fMRI datasets were preprocessed by the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) ( ,  ), which is a convenient plug-in software based on Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) package and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST) ( ,  ). The image preprocessing consists of the following steps ( ): \n  \nThe first 4 image volumes within each fMRI dataset were discarded. \n  \nAll volume slices were corrected for different signal acquisition times by shifting the signal measured in each slice relative to the acquisition of the slice at the mid-point of each TR. \n  \nThe images for each fMRI dataset were realigned using a six-parameter (rigid body) linear transformation with a two-pass procedure (registered to the first image and then registered to the mean of the images after the first realignment). \n  \nIndividual structural images (T1-weighted MPRAGE) were co-registered to the mean functional image after realignment using a six degrees-of-freedom linear transformation without re-sampling. \n  \nThe transformed structural images were segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ( ). The Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) tool was used to compute transformations from individual native space to MNI space ( ). \n  \nThe Friston 24-parameter model was used to regress out head motion effects from the realigned data ( ). \n  \nThe signals from WM and CSF were regressed out to reduce respiratory and cardiac effects. Since previous studies showed that global signal regression (GSR) could yield substantial increases in negative correlations, GSR was not performed ( ). \n  \nThe images were registered in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space with 3 mm  cubic voxels by using transformation information acquired from DARTEL. The images were further smoothed by a kernel of 6 mm. \n  \nTemporal filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz) was performed on the time series to remove low-frequency drifts and high-frequency noise from the signal. \n  \nAccording to Andrews-Hanna et al. ( ), 18 sphere regions of interest (ROIs) with a radius of 10 mm within DMN were defined. The centroid coordinate of each sphere ROI is shown in  . The signal time series of each ROI was computed as the mean value of voxels within this ROI. \n    \nThe 18 DMN ROIs defined in the current study. \n  \n\n### Computing dynamic functional connectivities between ROIs \n  \nThe dynamic functional connectivities (dFCs) between ROIs were assessed through the DCC method, which possesses at least the following advantages ( ,  ). Firstly, unlike the traditional sliding-window (SW) based techniques, it does not need to choose a window length which is usually arbitrarily decided by researchers in SW-based techniques and could provide a functional connectivity level at a specific time point instead of a time window in SW-based techniques. Secondly, the test-retest reliability of the metrics provided by the DCC method is much higher than those of the SW techniques ( ). \n\nBefore computing the DCC, each ROI signal with length T should be converted to a mean zero time series. Assume   y   is the converted time series of an ROI pair with dimension 2×T. The dynamic correlations   R   with dimension 1×T can be calculated using the following equations: \n\nFirstly, each ROI time series within   y   is modeled by a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) model, which expresses the conditional variance of a single time series at time t as a linear combination of past values of the conditional variance and of the squared process itself [equation (1)]. Secondly, the standardized residual ε  was computed through equation (2) and equation (3). Thirdly, the non-normalized version of the time-varying correlation matrix   Q   was computed using an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) window [equation (4)]. Note that, in equation (4),   θ   and   θ   are non-negative scalars satisfying 0 <   θ   +   θ   <1,   can be calculated as   Lastly,   Q   is rescaled, which creates the dynamic correlations   R  . \n\n\n### Constructing time-varying complex networks using minimal spanning tree (MST) \n  \nAfter the dFCs of all ROI pairs were assessed through the approach illustrated above, we obtained a time-varying correlation matrix   C   with dimension   N   ×   N   ×   T  , where N and T were the number of ROIs and time points, respectively.   C  (  i, j, k  ) indicates the FC between ROI   #i   and ROI   #j   at time point k. \n\nIn this study, we used minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis to build the time-varying complex network within DMN. The MST consists of the strongest connections in the entire weighted undirected graph so that the sum of the weights of the edges (i.e., the reciprocal of DCC at a specific time point) included in the tree is minimized without forming cycles ( ,  ). The MST is a connected graph without loops between nodes (i.e., the 18 ROIs within DMN) and without isolated nodes (i.e., there exists a path between each pair of nodes in the graph). An MST with N nodes has exactly   N  -1 edges/connections. Assuming the number of nodes is   N  , the MST at each time point was produced using Kruskal's algorithm in the following manner ( ). Firstly, all the connections at a given time point were ranked from lowest to highest “weight”. As discussed above, the “weight” was calculated as the reciprocal of connection strength, and thus can be considered as the cost of information exchange between nodes. Secondly, after all the connections were removed, the connection with the lowest weight was added. Then, the connection with the second lowest weight was added and this procedure was repeated until all nodes were connected. If adding a new connection resulted in a cycle or loop, this connection was discarded, and the next connection ranked by weight was added to the graph. Lastly, the graph thus constructed was binarized (i.e., the existing edges and non-existing edges were given a value of 1 and 0 respectively). \n\n\n### Computing the MST parameters \n  \nAfter the MST at each time point was constructed, the following parameters of each MST were computed ( – ). \n  \nThe degree of certain node   k   (where   i   = 1, …,   N  ). It is defined as the number of connections or edges for a given node. The nodes with high degree are “  hub nodes  ” in the MST and are crucial to the information exchange between distinct nodes. \n  \nThe degree of certain MST   K  . It is the degree of the node with maximum degree:   K   =   max  (  k  ). \n  \nThe leaf fraction of certain MST   L  . The “  leaf   ” refers to the node with only one connection. The leaf number in an MST ranges between 2 (a line-topology) and a maximum value   N   − 1 (a star-like topology). Leaf fraction is the actual leaf number divided by the maximum possible leaf number:   L   =   L  /(  N   − 1), where   L   is the actual leaf number in the MST. Thus, the leaf number, together with the leaf fraction, could be used to describe to what extent the MST has a central organization. A high value of leaf number or leaf fraction indicates that the communication within the network is largely dependent on hub nodes. \n  \nThe assortativity coefficient of certain MST   R  . It equals the Pearson correlation coefficient of the degrees of two nodes at the end of connections, and ranges between−1 and 1. If 0 <   R   < 1, the MST is an assortative network, otherwise, it's a disassortative network. \n  \nThe diameter of certain MST   D  . It is defined as the maximum value among lengths of all the available shortest paths. In MST, the shortest path between two nodes is defined as the path with least connections, and its length is the number of connections within this shortest path. \n  \nThe betweenness centrality of certain node   BC   (where   i   = 1, …,   N  ). It is defined as the total number of shortest paths between any two nodes that are passing node   i  , divided by the total number of shortest paths in the network:  , where   A   is the total number of shortest paths that are passing node   i  . Nodes with a high   BC   are considered “  hub nodes  ” not based on their number of connections, but on their importance for global communication in the network. \n  \nThe betweenness centrality of certain MST   BC  . It is the maximum value of nodal betweenness centrality:   BC   = max(  BC  ). It could also be used to describe the global network organization of MST. In star-like topography, the   BC   value of MST equals to 1. \n  \nThe global efficiency of certain MST   E  . It measures the average inverse shortest path length in the network, and thus relates to the efficiency of information exchange within the network. \n  \nThe characteristic path length of certain MST   L  . It refers to the average of all the shortest path lengths in the network and could be used to assess the cost of information transfer within the network. \n  \nThe degree divergence of certain MST κ. It measures the broadness of the degree distribution and could be calculated using the following formula:  , where   k   is the degree of nodes. This measure is believed to be related to resilience against attacks on the network. Higher κ indicates a broader degree of distribution and higher vulnerability for targeted attacks. \n  \nThe tree hierarchy of certain MST   T  . It characterizes the balance between network integration and overload of central nodes and can be computed using the following formula:  , where   L  ,   M  , and   BC   are the leaf number, edge/connection number (i.e.,   N  −1), and betweenness centrality of the MST. \n  \nThe eccentricity of node   ecc   (where   i   = 1, …,   N  ). It is defined as the longest distance between a certain node and the other nodes. Nodes with lower eccentricity are more prone to be hub nodes within the network. \n  \n\n### Computing summary statistics of MST parameters \n  \nAfter all the network-level parameters (i.e.,   K, L  ,   R, D, BC, E, L  , κ and   T  ) and node-level parameters (i.e.,   k  ,   BC  ,   ecc  , where   i   = 1, …,   N  ) were evaluated for the MST of each time point, we computed two basic summary statistics for each parameter above, i.e., their temporal means and temporal variances. More information about summary statistics computation can be seen in  . \n  \nThe computation pipeline of the summary statistics of MST parameters. \n  \n\n### Statistical tests on summary statistics of MST parameters \n  \nFor the temporal mean and variance of network-level parameters and node-level parameters, independent   t-  tests were conducted with groups (ASD group vs. TD group) as independent variables, after controlling the effects of the following variables: the age at scan, func_mean_fd, func_perc_fd, IQ score, gender, and sites. To control the multiple comparison problem when testing the summary statistics of node-level MST parameters, the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure was used ( ). The threshold for significance was   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n### Correlations with autistic symptom severity \n  \nTo investigate the relationship between the two summary statistics of MST parameters and scores of autistic symptom severity in the ASD group, the Pearson correlation coefficients between the two summary statistics of MST parameters and symptom severity as assessed by the ADOS total (ADOS_TOTAL), communication (ADOS_COMM), social (ADOS_SOCIAL) and stereotyped behavior (ADOS_STEREO_BEHAV) scores were calculated after controlling the effects of following variables: the age at scan, func_mean_fd, func_perc_fd, IQ score, gender, and sites. The significance of the correlation coefficients was assessed with a   t-  statistic. The threshold for significance was   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Group differences in the temporal mean and variance of MST parameters \n  \nThe results of statistical tests conducted on the temporal mean of MST parameters are shown in   and  .

Then, network-level and node-level graph theory-based MST parameters were derived from MST of each sampling point. The temporal mean and variance of these MST parameters were further computed. We found that the two summary statistics of certain MST parameters were significantly altered in the ASD group, which suggests that the topographical configuration of the cortical network within DMN, along with its temporal dynamics, were significantly altered in the autistic brain. Moreover, using correlation analysis, we found that these alterations were significantly associated with the autistic symptom severity of persons with ASD. \n\n### Altered MST parameters within DMN \n  \nStatistical tests conducted on the two summary statistics (i.e., temporal mean and variance) of MST parameters revealed some interesting results. \n\nFirst, compared with those of the TD group, the temporal mean and variance of betweenness centrality of ROI #1 (i.e., aMPFC) were significantly smaller in ASD group, whereas the temporal mean and variance of eccentricity of ROI #1 (i.e., aMPFC) were significantly larger in ASD group. The relatively smaller temporal mean and variance of betweenness centrality of aMPFC suggest that in the autistic brain, the aMPFC is in a relatively inferior position since the less short paths are passing aMPFC. Moreover, compared with the autistic brain, the position of aMPFC varied drastically in a typically developing brain. The statistical results of eccentricity suggest that in the autistic brain, aMPFC locates away from the center of DMN and the distance from aMPFC to the other regions within DMN varies drastically. The aMPFC, especially the dorsal part, is supposed to be involved in social cognition processes, such as self-referential processes ( ). The altered MST parameters related to aMPFC (i.e., reduced temporal mean and variance of betweenness centrality, enhanced temporal mean, and variance of eccentricity) may reduce the efficiency of information communication between aMPFC and other DMN regions. Considering the functions of aMPFC in the human cognition system, we supposed that the altered MST parameters related to aMPFC should result in the reduced efficiency of social information processing, such as the self-reference process in the autistic brain. \n\nSecond, as for ROI #2 (i.e., PCC), although none of the temporal means of MST parameters related to this brain region was found to be significantly altered, the temporal variance of eccentricity of PCC was significantly larger in persons with ASD. The PCC plays a crucial role in various cognitive functions, such as autobiographical memory (especially those involving friends and family members), and evaluation of valence of emotional stimuli ( ,  ). Certain cognitive processes involving PCC were closely associated with the successful completion of social communication and social information processing. Jia et al. ( ) have proved that significantly much lower and more volatile connections between PCC and other DMN regions were an important pathological feature of the ASD. Taken together with Jia et al. ( ), the PCC of the autistic brain manifests the following characteristics: drastic variations of its distance to other DMN regions, and much lower and more volatile information exchange efficiency between PCC and other DMN regions. This will certainly reduce the efficiency and stability of information communication between aMPFC and other DMN regions. Considering the functions of PCC in social cognition, we supposed that the altered MST parameters related to PCC revealed in this study could impair the social information processing in the autistic brain and may contribute to the emergence of ASD-related symptoms. \n\nNote that the reduced stability of information communication in social cognition related regions was supported by group comparison results of temporal variances of “position-related” parameters for ROI #6 (i.e., lTempP) and ROI #16 (i.e., rRsp).   shows the temporal variance of betweenness centrality of ROI #6 (i.e., lTempP) and the eccentricity of ROI #16 (i.e., rRsp) was significantly enlarged in autistic brains. These two cortical regions are crucial regions of the so-called “  social brain  ” ( ). \n\nThird, statistical tests conducted on the temporal mean and variance of network-level MST parameters revealed that compared with those of the TD group, the temporal mean of betweenness centrality of MST was significantly smaller in the ASD group, whereas the temporal variance of betweenness centrality of MST was significantly larger in ASD group. Since the betweenness centrality of certain MST is defined as the maximum value of nodal betweenness centrality and could be used to describe the global network organization of MST, the above results suggest that the “load” of central nodes is much lower (i.e., the topographical configuration tends to be “link-like” topology) and varies drastically in the brain network of autistic brain ( ). Considering the formula of the tree hierarchy of MST (i.e., the tree hierarchy of certain MST is the reciprocal of the betweenness centrality of this MST), the results of statistical tests conducted on the summary statistics of the tree hierarchy of certain MST could be easily verified. Moreover, these results were consistent with the results of global efficiency and characteristic path length: compared with those of the TD group, the temporal mean of global efficiency was significantly smaller, and the temporal variances of global efficiency and characteristic path length were significantly larger in the ASD group. Given the functional significance of these MST parameters, all these facts (i.e., altered topographical configuration, global efficiency, and characteristic path length) should lead to significantly lower efficiency and less robustness of information transfer within the DMN of the autistic brain, which should further affect the cognitive processes related with DMN (e.g., social information processing). \n\n\n### Correlations between MST parameters and symptom severity \n  \nThe correlation analysis between summary statistics of MST parameters and ADOS scores provide further evidence about the aberrant global network organization of DMN in the autistic brain. \n\nFirst, as for ROI #4 (i.e., lTPJ), we found that the temporal mean of betweenness centrality of lTPJ and the temporal mean and variance of degree of lTPJ were significantly negatively correlated with the ADOS_COMM score and the ADOS_TOTAL score, whereas the temporal mean and variance of eccentricity of lTPJ were significantly positively correlated with the ADOS_COMM score and the ADOS_TOTAL score. These results indicated that “  the position of lTPJ within DMN  ” could predict the autistic symptom severity of persons with ASD, and are highly consistent with previously published studies ( ). For example, Jia et al. ( ) found that the abnormal connections of lTPJ and the other regions within DMN were closely associated with the autistic symptom severity, especially the ADOS_COMM score. These results support the presumed functions of lTPJ (e.g., social communication development, joint attention, and theory of mind) and its role in the neuropathological mechanism of autism ( ). \n\nSecond, the temporal mean of degree of ROI #9 (i.e., rTempP) was significantly negatively correlated with the ADOS_COMM score. The right temporal pole (rTemP) is crucial to understanding the mental state of others and the social communication ( ). The relatively smaller degree of rTemP leads to the result that the information exchange efficiency related to rTemP is much lower and more paths are needed to communicate with this region, which may damage the social communication efficiency of persons with ASD. \n\nThird, as for the temporal variances of MST parameters, the temporal variances of betweenness centrality of ROI #7 (rTPJ), eccentricity of ROI #12 (lRsp), eccentricity of ROI #14 (lHF ), and degree of ROI #15 (rpIPL), global efficiency was significantly positively correlated with the ADOS scores. These results indicate that the volatility of certain node-level/global level MST parameters could predict the pathological behavior and the defect in the social communication ability of these patients. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nIn the current study, the preprocessing pipeline has several separately conducted steps; each designed to remove a specific type or class of artifacts. This approach is named as “  the modular preprocessing approach  ”, and has been commonly used in RS-fMRI studies ( ). However, Lindquist et al. ( ) showed that preprocessing steps performed at a later stage of the pipeline may potentially re-introduce artifacts that had previously been removed from the data in an earlier step, which may induce adverse effects on dFC estimations ( ). They suggested that one way to avoid this problem was to simultaneously perform different preprocessing steps within an omnibus framework. In future studies, we need to perform the RS-fMRI preprocessing using the framework provided by Lindquist et al. ( ), and test whether the preprocessing framework affects the main results revealed here. \n\nSecondly, in the RS-fMRI datasets used here, the autistic symptom severity of persons with ASD was assessed   via   ADOS-module 3 or ADOS-module 4, and we did not consider the differences in the module of the ADOS. For the sake of completeness, we provided the Pearson correlation coefficients between the temporal mean/variance of MST parameters and autistic symptom severity assessed by ADOS-module 3/ ADOS-module 4 in  . The results presented in these four tables were not completely consistent with those displayed in  ,   shown above. Although inconsistency could be clearly observed between these tables, the main conclusions of correlation analysis are still unchanged, i.e., the significantly lower and more volatile information communication within DMN is closely associated with the autistic symptom severity. \n\nThirdly, many graph theory-based complex network parameters which could be classified into the network-level parameters and node-level parameters were derived in our study. For these parameters, independent   t-  tests were conducted with groups (ASD group vs. TD group) as an independent variable, after controlling the effects of certain confounding variables. Then FDR procedure was applied for each node-level parameter, which may not fully control the multiple comparison problems. In the following statistical test, all the network-level and node-level parameters were included in the FDR procedure. We found that the   p  -values of the temporal means of tree hierarchy and global efficiency only reached a marginally significant level, and the statistical significance of other parameters did not change. This indicated that the FDR procedure could not significantly influence the conclusions revealed here. \n\nFourthly, we performed correlational analyses on the temporal mean and variance of all the parameters and did not merely focus on those showing significant between-group differences. This was because we believed that significant between-group differences revealed on certain parameters did not signify these parameters could predict the autistic symptom severity, and vice versa. Moreover, since the ADOS scores of some patients were invalid, the number of patients involved in group difference tests was larger than that involved in correlational analyses. All these arguments were supported by the fact that the parameters with significant correlation coefficients were not limited to the parameters with significant group differences. \n\nLastly, it is well known that ASD could affect the normal functioning of several brain networks, such as the DMN, salience network (SN), language network, and attention network ( ,  ,  – ). It is difficult to investigate the spatial organizations of all the networks within a single study, thus we focused on the DMN, which has been consistently observed in previous studies. In future studies, the dFCs and the MST characters of other cortical networks should be studied. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn the current study, using the DCC technique and MST approach, the temporal dynamic features (i.e., temporal mean and variance) of topographical configuration of the cortical network within DMN of persons with ASD were investigated. The following conclusions could be derived from the statistical tests and correlation analyses. Firstly, in the autistic brain, aMPFC and PCC which are core regions of DMN locate away from the center of DMN. The information exchange efficiency between cortical regions within DMN is significantly lower and more volatile for patients with ASD. Secondly, the significantly lower and more volatile information communication within DMN is closely associated with autistic symptom severity. These results provide a novel insight into the possible neuropathological mechanism of ASD. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of 17 Institutions (i.e., California Institute of Technology/Carnegie Mellon University/Kennedy Krieger Institute/Ludwig Maximilians University Munich/NYU Langone Medical Center/Olin Center, Institute of Living at Hartford Hospital/Oregon Health and Science University/San Diego State University/BCN NeuroImaging Center, University Medical Center Groningen/Stanford University/Trinity Centre for Health Sciences/University of California, Los Angeles/University of Leuven/University of Michigan/University of Pittsburgh/University of Utah/Yale Child Study Center).

To date, the literature examining the long-term impact of early life adversity has largely investigated structural and functional imaging data outcomes independently. However, emerging research points to a relationship between functional connectivity and the brain’s underlying structural architecture. For instance, functional connectivity can be mediated by the presence of direct or indirect anatomical pathways. Such evidence warrants the use of structural and functional imaging in tandem to study network maturation. Accordingly, this study examines the impact of poor maternal mental health and socioeconomic context during the perinatal period on network connectivity in middle childhood using an anatomically weighted functional connectivity (awFC) approach. awFC is a statistical model that identifies neural networks by incorporating information from both structural and functional imaging data. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nResting-state fMRI and DTI scans were acquired from children aged 7–9 years old. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nOur results indicate that maternal adversity during the perinatal period can affect offspring’s resting-state network connectivity during middle childhood.

Furthermore, our results suggest that there is value in using an awFC approach as it may be more sensitive in highlighting connectivity differences in developmental networks associated with higher-order cognitive and emotional processing, as compared to stand-alone FC or SC analyses. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nResting-state fMRI is a neuroimaging technique that has been used to map functional brain networks comprised of cortical and subcortical regions ( ) when an individual is at rest. A measure of functional connectivity (FC) can be derived from rsfMRI. FC refers to the temporal correlation between brain activity in spatially distinct regions. It is commonly assumed that regions belong to the same network if their functional activity is correlated. During middle childhood, resting state networks (RSNs) have not reached full maturity and are continually undergoing constant changes (i.e., reorganization, strengthening/weaking of connections, segregation/integration) ( ;  ). Network maturation reflects functional specialization as neural assemblies and regions that make up functional cortical subunits become increasingly domain-specific and there is a shift from engaging diffuse regions to more focal brain activation patterns ( ;  ). Thus as development proceeds there is a shift from more diffuse less functionally specialized regions assembled in short-range circuits to more functionally specialized focal regions that are more broadly distributed. This configuration is particularly important for complex, “higher-order” cognitive capacities because it provides for the synchronization of processing across functionally specialized regions that are distal to one another ( ;  ). Increases in cortico-cortical connectivity as opposed to strong and abundant subcortico-cortical connectivity are also observed ( ). However, temporally correlated activity does not provide an indication of direct anatomical connections between brain regions. \n\nTo examine structural connectivity (SC), DTI is an MRI technique that identifies white matter pathways, non-invasively ( ). Structural connectivity refers to the presence of physical white matter pathways that connect brain regions and can be measured using DTI metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA). Across childhood and adolescence cortical white matter increases linearly, and reflects changes in myelination during this period ( ). As the children in our cohort are now in middle childhood, we are presented with a unique opportunity to study how brain changes in structure and function relate to the acquisition of emergent developmental capacities. \n\nEvidently, FC and SC capture distinct but interrelated properties of the brain-network connectome ( ). Importantly, the trajectory of functional connectivity within brain networks may be mediated by ongoing structural developmental processes (i.e., myelination, pruning, etc.) ( ;  ). However, there is an imperfect correspondence between structural and functional connectivity ( ;  ). While strong SC is predictive of strong resting-state FC between regions, the reverse inference is not as reliable ( ;  ). As such, neither functional nor structural techniques alone can reveal a complete picture of brain maturation ( ), thereby warranting the study of how functional and structural connectivity interact during development. Previous research has suggested that a multimodal approach, combining parameters of DTI-based structural connectivity and fMRI-based resting-state functional connectivity to study development would make more effective use of information in MR scans as opposed to performing each technique independently ( ). \n\nAccordingly, in this study we employ a novel, multimodal imaging approach that examines functional and structural connectivity concurrently. Our pipeline uses a neuroimaging toolbox in combination with a mathematically dense approach for fusing fMRI and DTI metrics into a single combined measure. The neuroimaging toolbox applied in this study is known as Functional And Tractographic Analysis Toolbox (FATCAT) and consists of a set of AFNI commands that are publicly available for processing MRI data. The second component of the pipeline, the anatomically weighted functional connectivity (awFC) model, fuses FC and SC measures into a single unit identified as the awFC metric. Connectivity is measured differently by each modality. For instance, while structural connectivity counts the number of tracts, functional connectivity measures temporally correlated regions. By combining structural and functional dissimilarity multiplicatively, the awFC merges structural and functional connectivity in a modality-independent manner. The awFC metric can provide a quantitative measure of the combined impact of structural and functional connectivity on brain networks, rather than studying the connectivity from one perspective (one modality) alone. According to   and colleagues ( ), their proposed approach of multiplying both structural and functional connectivity data can generate a hybrid connectivity matrix that enables comprehensive analysis of brain networks. As a result, combining data from many modalities can theoretically lead to the provision of a more reliable inference on the “connectome” ( ). The awFC metric we describe, measures the combined effect of connectivity on brain networks. Given that the macroscopic connectome is a blend of structural and functional connectivity, combining structural and functional connection in a data fusion approach may provide a better representation of the complex human connectome. While the FATCAT-awFC pipeline was first introduced in  , here we explore the utility in applying a data fusion approach to study brain changes associated with development. This article extends our previous work by applying the method to study brain connectivity within RSNs in a sample of children aged 7–9 years old. \n\nAdverse maternal experiences early in a child’s life can have pervasive effects across the domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior ( ;  ;  ;  ). It is possible that early life experiences bias the allocation of resources toward neural systems that are critical for effective adaptation within the given environmental context ( ). For instance, neurodevelopmental patterns which favor emotional responses (e.g., hypervigilant limbic system, improved threat perception, stronger sympathetic activation, etc.) may give rise to maladaptive behavioral responses, and potentially establish a footing for poor psychiatric outcomes ( ). Therefore, while the precise underlying mechanisms remain unclear, alterations in structural and functional neurodevelopment are proposed as putative pathways by which adversity may become biologically embedded and transmit its effects across generations ( ). When studying the link between early adversity and subsequent neurodevelopmental outcomes, the timing of adversity exposure must be considered. Prenatal and postnatal periods of development are the most rapid phases of brain development during which formative processes such as neurogenesis, migration, differentiation, myelination, and synaptogenesis are occurring to establish the baseline framework for future development ( ). In early postnatal life, exuberant axonal removal also occurs to establish the number of connections that comprise the structural connectome ( ). At this time, there exists many sensitive periods of development which are characterized by heightened plasticity and vulnerability to the environment ( ). It follows that environmental insults during these early periods of development can interrupt normative developmental processes and leave lasting effects on development. As posited by proponents of the prenatal programming hypothesis, the in-utero environment provides cues to the fetus about its expected postnatal environment ( ). Upon exposure to adverse prenatal conditions, fetal brain development can calibrate in a manner that supports optimal functioning within an expected adverse postnatal environment ( ;  ). \n\nEmerging research continues to support the idea that there is immense potential for perturbations in the prenatal environment to redirect development. For instance, poor maternal mental health during pregnancy is linked to atypical emotional and cognitive development in the developing child. Children whose mothers experienced anxiety or depression during pregnancy are at increased risk for mental illnesses such as anxiety ( ;  ;  ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ( ;  ;  ), and conduct disorder ( ). These outcomes are likely a consequence of modifications in neurodevelopment.   report that prenatal maternal anxiety is associated with increased functional connectivity between earlier developing brain regions associated with arousal and salience (e.g., brainstem and sensorimotor areas) and reduced functional connectivity between regions that subserve higher-order cognitive functions (i.e., executive control and default mode network regions). These alterations in child neurodevelopment are identifiable as early as the second trimester of pregnancy. A study exploring resting-state functional connectivity in infants aged 6 months also noted that prenatal maternal depression is associated with altered connectivity between the amygdala and other brain regions involved in emotion generation and regulation such as the temporal cortex, insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex ( ).   observed atypical structural and functional connectivity in the amygdala-dorsal prefrontal cortex circuity amongst infants exposed to prenatal maternal depression. Overall, such evidence points toward the propensity of maternal mental health to affect subsequent child neurodevelopment, especially in regions critical for salience detection and emotion regulation. \n\nSince adverse experiences are likely to exhibit continuity across time, it is critical to account for both prenatal and postnatal mental health experiences ( ). Poor postnatal maternal mental health can interfere with the capacity for sensitive and responsive caregiving, affecting the quality, and nature of the child’s early environment. Reductions in the amount of social and emotional stimulation and can have pervasive effects on subsequent child development ( ;  ). For instance, functional neuroimaging studies have repeatedly shown associations between postnatal depressive symptoms and altered functional connectivity between limbic regions and mesocortical and mesolimbic networks ( ;  ), reshaping the capacity for emotion regulation and reward learning. Structurally, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) investigations have revealed that children exposed to prenatal or postnatal maternal depression exhibit microstructural alterations in limbic regions, prefrontal areas, the cingulum, corpus callosum, and fornix ( ;  ). The directionality of changes in diffusivity remains inconsistent for the amygdala and frontal regions however, reduced anisotropy and increased diffusivity in the cingulum is often reported ( ). Maternal anxiety during pregnancy is negatively associated with fractional anisotropy in prefrontal regions, the middle frontal gyrus, and fornix ( ). Ultimately, these changes in white matter connectivity may underlie difficulties observed in executive functioning, attention, and emotion regulation. \n\nAdverse experiences tend to co-occur ( ). As demonstrated by the adverse childhood experiences (ACE) study, there exists a strong relationship between the number of adverse childhood exposures and the number of long-term health risk factors, suggesting that the effect of ACEs on long-term health may be robust and cumulative ( ). Accordingly, it is recommended that research considers the impact of unique combinations of adverse exposures on long-term health outcomes ( ). Several studies have reported higher rates of poor maternal mental health in low socioeconomic contexts ( ;  ;  ;  ). Therefore, in the present work, we explore how early life exposure to poor maternal mental health and socioeconomic status affects child neurodevelopment years later. Socioeconomic status (SES) can be regarded as one’s access to material and social resources (e.g., nutrition, housing, safe neighborhoods, income, and education). SES-related health disparities pose a risk for the physical and mental health and wellbeing of a mother during pregnancy as well as her child. In fact, SES reportedly moderates the impact of poor maternal health on offspring outcomes ( ,  ;  ). Postnatally, a low SES in childhood can set constraints on the quality of learning experiences that the child gains as he/she engages with their environment. It has been found that the risk of developing mental health conditions (e.g., ADHD, externalizing problems, depression, substance use, schizophrenia, etc.) over the lifespan is two to three times higher for those from a low SES background ( ). Deficits in language development and executive functioning are commonly reported outcomes linked to SES ( ;  ). Functional neuroimaging studies also report evidence of altered neural activation in regions associated with language processing in children from lower SES backgrounds ( ;  ). In neonates, infants, and children, SES is associated with altered maturation in neural networks underlying sensory, emotional, and executive functioning ( ;  ;  ). \n\nOverall, evidence of atypical brain connectivity in the offspring of mothers who experienced pre or postnatal adversity has been demonstrated through fMRI and DTI studies ( ;  ;  ). However, to date, there remains limited research exploring the impact of maternal adversity on structural and functional maturational particularly during the middle childhood period. Movement and low compliance with task demands pose obstacles in using MRI to study development within this age group, thereby hampering progress in our understanding of brain maturation. Here we apply stringent criteria ( ) for movement during rsfMRI; opting for improved data quality at a cost to study sample size. We acknowledge, the limitations imposed by these steps, however, as an initial examination of our data, we were interested in understanding whether the predicted alterations in FC and SC associated with maternal adversity exposure were captured best using a multimodal data fusion approach. As such, in the following study, we concurrently study structural and functional neurodevelopment using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) within a sample of 7–9-year-old children whose mothers experienced adversity during the prenatal and/or postnatal period and a sample of similarly matched healthy control children. We hypothesized that children of mothers who experienced adversity will exhibit greater awFC between regions in RSNs in comparison to controls. As early adversity is associated with aberrant white matter ( ;  ) and gray matter development ( ;  ;  ), we suggest that examining both features of development in one comparison may be more informative to our understanding of the relation between perinatal maternal adversity and child neurodevelopment. We acknowledge that early life environmental experiences may influence the allocation of resources in favor of developing systems that are critical for adaption within a certain environmental context ( ). \n\n\n## 2. Materials and methods \n  \n### 2.1. Sample \n  \nOur sample consisted of mother-infant dyads from the MAVAN (Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability, and Neurodevelopment) cohort—a longitudinal birth cohort from Hamilton, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec. Beginning from 6 months, children were assessed using behavioral, cognitive, and diagnostic tools. Information regarding prenatal and postnatal experiences were acquired from mothers. Inclusion criteria included mothers who were above the age of 18, delivered a singleton pregnancy, and fluent in English or French. Exclusion criteria entailed mothers with a history of incompetent cervix, presence of placenta previa, maternal severe chronic illness, impending delivery, or a fetus affected by a major anomaly. Ethics approval was obtained from Hamilton Integrated Research Board and the Douglas Mental Health University Institute. Informed consent was acquired from all participants. Compensation of $25 was provided for every visit. \n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging and DTI data was available for 33 MAVAN children in the middle childhood age group and thus, analyses were conducted using this subsample. Excluded from analysis were children with head motion that exceeded a relative mean displacement of 0.55 mm. This stringent threshold was considered an important criterion given our sample age and resulted in the loss of eight children from the sample (see  ). Scans that had missing resting-state fMRI data points (  n   = 2), rsfMRI artifacts (signal inhomogeneity) (  n   = 1), or missing DTI data (  n   = 5) were omitted from the analysis. Our final sample included a total of 17 subjects (11 females, 6 males)—9 children whose mothers did not have a history of prenatal and/or postnatal adversity (7 females, 2 males) and 8 children with history of maternal adversity (4 females, 4 males). Children were between the ages of 7 and 9 years old (mean = 7.63 years;   SD   = 0.66). \n\n\n### 2.2. Maternal adversity score \n  \nMaternal adversity is represented by a composite binary adversity score which accounts for perinatal maternal mental health (i.e., anxiety and/or depression) as well as socioeconomic status. This composite score was generated by researchers at the Women’s Health Concerns Clinic in Hamilton, Ontario. Maternal depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The EPDS is a 10-item, self-report questionnaire that provides an indication of depressive symptomatology during the perinatal period ( ). The MADRS is a 10-item clinician-rated scale assessing symptom severity if depression is suspected ( ). Maternal anxiety was probed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). The STAI is a self-report measure of trait (general feelings) and state (momentary feelings) anxiety ( ). The HAM-A is a 14-item, clinician-report measure that assesses the severity of anxiety symptoms. If a mother achieved an EPDS score >11 or a STAI score >29 and HAM-A score >17, or MADRS score >6, they were classified as experiencing perinatal depression and/or anxiety. Low socioeconomic status was declared if the parental income met or fell below the low-income tax cut-off level (i.e., ∼$30,000). Prenatal assessments were collected between 12 and 36 weeks and postnatal assessments were obtained within the first postnatal year. \n\nOne point was assigned for the presence of perinatal depression and/or anxiety and/or low SES status. For group analyses, children with a maternal adversity score above 1 were assigned to the adversity group, while those with a score of 0 were placed in the healthy control group. \n\n\n### 2.3. Magnetic resonance imaging \n  \nIn a separate visit prior to MRI acquisition, children were invited for a mock scanning session to get familiarized with the scanning environment. Magnetic resonance images were acquired using a GE Discovery 750 3T MR scanner (General Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) with a 32-channel head coil at the Imaging Research Centre, St. Joseph’s Healthcare (Hamilton, Canada), and a 3T Siemens Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at the Cerebral Imaging Center, Douglas Research Centre (Montreal, Canada). \n\nFunctional images were obtained using a single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) and the acquisition parameters included: TE (echo time) = 35 ms, TR (repetition time) = 3,000 ms, flip angle = 90, matrix = 64 × 64 × 45, voxel size = 3.75 mm × 3.75 mm × 3 mm, interslice gap = 0, slice thickness = 3 mm, FOV = 24 cm , 108 volumes (scan time 5.4 min), ascending interleaved sequence. Diffusion tensor images were acquired with a single-shot spin-echo EPI sequence, with 66 gradient directions at 1,000 s/mm . Additional DTI parameters included:   TE   = 87 ms,   TR   = 8,800 ms, matrix = 122 × 122 × 70, voxel size = 2 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm, FOV = 24.4 cm , 70 ascending interleaved slices, slice thickness = 2 mm (no slice spacing). Three non-diffusion weighted b = 0 s/mm  images were also collected. \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging scanning was well-tolerated, and positive feedback was provided by the parents, including indications of willingness to participate in future studies. \n\n\n\n## 3. Analyses \n  \n### 3.1. Functional magnetic resonance imaging pre-processing and motion correction \n  \nResting-state functional data were pre-processed using FSL version 6.0.1 ( ), using standard protocols as described in prior analyses ( ). Pre-processing steps included: (1) discarding the first three volumes of every participant’s functional data to account for magnetic field homogenization, (2) interleaved slice timing correction, (3) brain extraction toolbox (BET) ( ) for skull stripping, (4) motion correction using   MCFLIRT   ( ), (5) spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel with FWHM = 5 mm, and (6) high pass filtering (0.1 Hz). Functional data was normalized and registered to standard MNI152 space (12 DOF) and resampled to a 4-mm cubic voxel for subsequent analysis. \n\nAn additional step was introduced in the standard pre-processing pipeline ( ), which involves despiking the functional data using AFNI (version 18.2.15) ( ). This method is said to be more effective than other motion correction methods such as scrubbing ( ). \n\nA standard adult functional brain template (MNI 152) was used for registration and normalization. Previous studies by   and   demonstrated that spatial registration of child data aged 5 and above and 6 and above, respectfully, to adult brains, are acceptable with negligible or minor distortions (if any). Additionally, children over the age of five do not undergo significant increases in brain volume ( ;  ). \n\nHead motion is a major source of artifacts in connectivity studies ( ), and thus, it is necessary to exclude subjects with gross motion ( ).   deemed gross motion in functional data as having a relative mean displacement greater than 0.55 mm. Therefore, subjects with an average relative volume-volume displacement greater than 0.55 mm were excluded from our study (  n   = 8). While our final sample size was impacted by this criterion, it is important to be stringent on motion parameters. \n\nFive RSNs were examined: the default mode network (DMN), involved in internally generated thoughts, the limbic network (LIM), participating in emotion regulation, and the ventral attention network (VAN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and frontal parietal network (FPN), all of which subserve higher-order cognitive functions. Previous literature has reported that connectivity in these RSN’s has been impacted upon maternal adversity exposure ( ). \n\n\n### 3.2. Functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis using FATCAT \n  \nGroup independent component analysis (GICA) was applied to the resting data using MELODIC (FMRIB Analysis Group, Oxford University;  ;  ). The pre-processed functional data in MNI space was passed through the MELODIC GUI with the component number set at 20 and the decomposition approach set to multisession temporal concatenation. Independent components were compared and matched to the standard Yeo seven network template ( ) using a spatial cross correlation from FATCAT’s “  3dMatch  ” command ( ). Of the 20 components generated, five networks were consistent with standard RSNs (with a mean correlation of   r   = 0.62): DMN, FPN, LIM, VAN, and DAN. The remaining maps were either taken to be artifactual, noise or simply not matching with the components. Each of the independent component Z-score maps for the five identified networks were further segmented at the group level into discrete regions of interest (ROIs) using FATCATs “3dROIMaker” with an empirically determined threshold for each network, in order to use the ROIs with the diffusion data, the ROIs were transformed into diffusion-weighted space and inflated using FATCAT’s “  3dROIMaker”   command to overlap or abut white matter tracts. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the mean time courses of each ROI pair, using the non-inflated ROIs with FATCAT’s “  3dNetCorr”   command ( ). Functional connectivity (Pearson’s correlation) was estimated for each subject. Functional connectivity group differences were then investigated using a Wilcoxon-test between the adversity exposed and control groups using R code and corrected for multiple comparisons (which will be discussed in greater detail later in this section). Statistically significant (  p   < 0.05) group differences were identified and reported in this study as “conventional functional connectivity.” \n\n\n### 3.3. Diffusion tensor imaging pre-processing \n  \nDiffusion tensor imaging pre-processing steps were performed using a source-code repository ( ). Pre-processing involved a combination of FSL and AFNI commands and consisted of the following steps: (1) Diffusion-weighted images and   b   = 0 images were converted from DICOM to NIFIT using dcm2nii, (2) Eddy current distortions and motion were corrected (registered to   b   = 0 reference volume) with FSL’s “  eddy_correct”   command ( ) and diffusion vectors were rotated, (3) DTI images were skull stripped using FSL’s “BET” ( ) (4) FATCAT’s “  3dDWItoDT  ” ( ) was applied for diffusion tensor fitting, and FA maps were generated (in diffusion-weighted space), (5) FA maps were spatially normalized to a standard FA template (FMRIB58) for group analysis. \n\n\n### 3.4. Diffusion tensor imaging analysis using FATCAT \n  \nUncertainty maps from FA and principal eigenvector were generated, with the FATCAT command “  3dDWUncert”   ( ) to include in probabilistic tractography. Probabilistic tracking was then estimated between inflated ROI-pairs using FATCAT’s “3dTrackID” ( ) with the default standard settings:   FA   = 0.2, turning angle = 60, Monte Carlo iterations = 1,000. The DTI measures, such as the distance and number of tracts between each inflated group-level ROI pair were estimated for each subject. “Conventional structural connectivity” was calculated by counting the number of tracts between two ROIs (a DTI metric output by FATCAT). Group-level comparison of structural connectivity was performed to study differences between adversity and control groups. Between-group comparisons were performed with a Wilcox-test and corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. Comparisons that were statistically significant (  p   < 0.05) are reported in this study and discussed. \n\n\n### 3.5. Combined structural and functional connectivity analysis using the awFC method \n  \n depicts how the   FATCAT-awFC   pipeline begins with the FATCAT and later transitions into the awFC method. From the FATCAT, functional connectivity (from the functional data) and “tract count” (from the structural data) are output. Subsequently, these two metrics are used as inputs for the awFC method. \n  \nFunctional And Tractographic Analysis Toolbox-awFC pipeline. This is a two-stage pipeline and when combined, results in a more straightforward approach for combining fMRI and DTI data. The first stage is the “Functional and Tractographic Connectivity Analysis Toolbox” (FATCAT) pipeline. The outputs include functional connectivity (derived from fMRI) and the number of tracts (derived from DTI). The second stage of the pipeline is known as the anatomically weighted functional connectivity (awFC), which processes the output of FATCAT to produce the anatomically weighted functional connectivity measure (awFC measure). fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; DTI, diffusion tensor imaging; DT, diffusion tensor; ICA, independent component analysis; ROIs, regions of interest; SC, structural connectivity; FC, functional connectivity; awFd, anatomically weighted functional dissimilarity; awFC, anatomically weighted functional connectivity; set of AFNI commands (3dMatch, 3dROIMaker, 3dNetCorr, 3dDWItoDT, 3dDWUncert, and 3dTrackID). \n  \nOnce “  tract count”   is output from the FATCAT approach ( ), a number of additional steps were performed using the awFC method to calculate   an improved   structural connectivity measure. These steps include: calculating the probabilities of structural connectivity, performing a Poisson-regression (to adjust for distance bias), computing and incorporating indirect (second-order) structural connectivity between ROI pairs ( ). Structural connectivity probabilities were estimated by calculating the 90th percentile of voxel-level counts connecting two ROIs, divided by the total streamlines leaving the ROI ( ). Next, the structural connectivity distance-bias was adjusted by fitting a zero-inflated Poisson regression model ( ). The Poisson regression was applied using:   log  (μ(  S  |  g  ) = α +α  g  , where   g  is the distance between each region pair,   S  is the unbiased number of tracts ( ). All possible second-order (indirect) connections were calculated using the equation: π  = max[π , max (π π )], where π is the probabilities of structural connectivity, i is the starting ROI, j is target ROI, and m is the third connection ( ). The greater connectivity value (between the direct and indirect connectivity) was taken to be the pathway between the connected ROIs ( ). Once all steps are performed, a structural connectivity metric is produced. \n\nFunctional connectivity was generated from the   FATCAT   pipeline and SC was produced from the   awFC method  . To combine FC and SC into a single metric, the dissimilarity metrics were first calculated ( ). FC and SC measure distinct aspects of brain connectivity, where FC measures the temporal correlation (using Pearson correlation), and SC measures the tract count between brain regions. Therefore, to generate a modality-independent comparison between structural and functional connectivity, the dissimilarity metric is used ( ). The structural dissimilarity (1 minus structural connectivity) and functional dissimilarity (1 minus functional connectivity) are multiplied to obtain the anatomically weighted functional dissimilarity. For ease of interpretation, the dissimilarity metric (a combined structural-functional measure) is transformed back to a correlation metric. This metric is known as the anatomically weighted functional connectivity, which is obtained by applying the equation: 1−|  awFd  | ( ). \n\n\n### 3.6. Wilcoxon test and multiple comparisons adjustment \n  \nA Wilcoxon test was applied to determine whether there were any significant FC, SC, and awFC differences between children of mothers who experienced perinatal adversity compared to healthy controls. The R function,   “wilcox.test(),”   was employed to assess pair-wise differences in FC, SC, and awFC between the adversity and control groups for each ROI-pair within each RSN. False Discovery Rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple comparisons ( )   via   the function   “p.adjust()”   from the stats package in R ( ). The significance level was set to   p   < 0.05. Significant awFC differences between the control and adversity groups were visualized using boxplots, with the   “ggplot()”   function from the ggplot2 package (v.2.2.1) in R software (v.4.0.2). Finally, the effect size was calculated using Cohen’s   d, “cohen.d”   function from the effsize package ( ) in R ( ). A Cohen’s d between 0.5 >   d   > 0.2 is considered small, 0.8 >   d   > 0.5 moderate and   d   ≥ 0.8 large. \n\n\n\n## 4. Results \n  \n### 4.1.

ROI-ROI awFC group differences \n  \nChildren of mothers who experienced prenatal and/or postnatal adversity showed lower awFC in a number of ROI-pairs compared to healthy controls ( ). Specifically, in comparison to healthy controls, the adversity group exhibited lower awFC in (i) the DMN—between the PCC and the left angular gyrus (  p   = 0.0274), (ii) the FPN—between the left inferior frontal gyrus to the lingual gyrus/cerebellum (  p   = 0.0053), and between the right superior frontal gyrus and the lingual gyrus/cerebellum (  p   = 0.0274), (iii) the LIM—between the right superior temporal gyrus and the left superior temporal gyrus (  p   = 0.00149), and (iv) the DAN—between the right posterior orbitofrontal gyrus and the left inferior temporal gyrus (  p   = 0.032). Conversely, children exposed to prenatal and/or postnatal maternal adversity showed greater awFC in the VAN—between the right anterior orbitofrontal gyrus and the left lingual gyrus/cuneus (  p   = 0.00551). Group comparisons are shown in the boxplots in  . The multiple tests performed in this study were corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) to account for the potential inflation of Type I error due to multiple comparisons. FDR correction is a statistical method that adjusts the   p  -values based on the number of tests performed and the proportion of truly null hypotheses. This helps to control the rate of false positive findings and provides a more stringent criterion for declaring statistical significance. The results were considered statistically significant if the FDR-corrected   p  -value was less than 0.05. \n  \nGroup differences in connectivity from structural, functional, and anatomically weighted functional connectivity. \n      \nBoxplots demonstrate the anatomically weighted functional connectivity strength in children of mothers with a high adversity score (orange boxes) compared to children of mothers with a lower adversity score (blue boxes).

ROI-ROI FC and SC group differences \n  \nIn comparison to healthy controls, children exposed to perinatal maternal adversity exhibited FC differences in: (i) the DMN—between the PCC and the left angular gyrus (FC   p   = 0.0274, SC   p   = 0.815), (ii) the FPN—between the left inferior frontal gyrus to the lingual gyrus/cerebellum (FC   p   = 0.006, SC   p   = 0.041), and between the right superior frontal gyrus and the lingual gyrus/cerebellum (FC   p   = 0.0274, SC   p   = 0.664), (iii) the LIM—between the right superior temporal gyrus and the left superior temporal gyrus (FC   p   = 0.002, SC   p   = 0.095), (iv) the VAN—between the right anterior orbitofrontal gyrus to the left lingual gyrus/cuneus (FC   p   = 0.032, SC   p   = 0.198), and (v) the DAN—between the right posterior orbitofrontal gyrus and the left inferior temporal gyrus (FC   p   = 0.00551, SC   p   = 0.06). See   for a summary of the results. \n\nGroup differences in SC were observed in the FPN–between the left inferior frontal gyrus and the lingual gyrus/cerebellum. However, this difference did not survive the correction for multiple comparisons. The multiple comparisons made in the study were corrected using FDR correction to control for false positive findings and identify statistical significance with a stringent criterion of FDR-corrected   p  -value less than 0.05. \n\n\n\n## 5. Discussion \n  \nAcross biological scales (i.e., cellular formation, synaptic formation/pruning, myelination, macroscale network connectivity), there is a developmental progression from primary unimodal somatosensory/motor and visual regions to transmodal association cortices which support the emergence of complex cognition ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Programmed neurodevelopmental events such as neurogenesis, myelination, and pruning drive the maturation of functional networks and brain structure ( ). Importantly, it is recognized that structural and functional development interact throughout development ( ;  ). Accordingly, in the present research, we identified differences in resting state networks, factoring in metrics of both FC and SC acquired from rs-fMRI and DTI imaging data. We hypothesized that the awFC method would provide a more sensitive approach to study network development in comparison to investigating SC and FC alone. The awFC method was used to explore differences in DMN, LIM, VAN, DAN, and FPN connectivity between children exposed to perinatal maternal adversity and a group of healthy control children. Our results suggest that in comparison to independent SC and FC analyses, the combined awFC method was more sensitive to differences in network connectivity within the LIM and FPN. We also found that children exposed to perinatal maternal adversity exhibited greater connectivity within the VAN in comparison to healthy controls. \n\n### 5.1. Comparing awFC with SC and FC across regions of the FPN and LIM that distinguish between adversity and healthy control groups \n  \nThe value of exploring differences in network connectivity using a fused structural-functional approach is reflected in our findings relating to the LIM and FPN. While analyses of group differences in SC and FC metrics separately identified network differences distinguishing the adversity from the control group, the connectivity differences were of greater significance when groups were contrasted using awFC data. These findings suggest that it may be important to consider the influence of SC when studying resting-state functional connectivity in developmental populations. \n\nUsing the awFC approach, we found that in comparison to healthy controls, children whose mothers experienced perinatal maternal adversity showed lower awFC in the FPN between the inferior frontal gyrus and cerebellum as well as the SFG and lingual gyrus. Our findings complement those from the maternal deprivation literature which consistently report that poor maternal mental health impacts the structural development of their offspring, especially in frontoparietal regions. For instance, postnatal depressive symptoms are negatively correlated with SFG thickness in children ( ). Similarly, fetal exposure to increasing levels of prenatal maternal stress is associated with reductions in SFG and lingual gyrus thickness ( ). It has been reported that brain regions which show cortical thinning also exhibit weakened connectivity ( ). Furthermore, research exploring the influence of SES on brain structure has revealed reduced cortical maturation (i.e., gray and white matter volume, integrity of WM tracts) in children exposed to low maternal SES compared to higher-SES children ( ). These differences are hypothesized to result from changes in neuronal morphology, dendritic arborization, or stunted/suppressed synaptogenesis ( ). The FPN is thought to play a role in executive functioning and cognitive control over emotion. Therefore, atypical FPN maturation may play a role in the widespread socioemotional, behavioral, and cognitive deficits reported among adversity exposed children ( ;  ;  ;  , ;  ;  ). Evidently, as the literature suggests, maternal adversity impacts the structural neurodevelopment of offspring. Our study emphasizes that when examining developmental differences associated with adversity exposure, it is important to consider how structure interacts with function, rather than studying only one modality in isolation. Specifically, we demonstrate that SC can impact on estimates of FC between regions of the FPN. Importantly, attention to the sensitivity of analytical techniques when studying outcomes of adversity exposure may yield important information that helps characterize altered maturational brain changes. \n\nThe adversity group also displayed lower awFC in the LIM between the left and right superior temporal gyrus in comparison to healthy controls. Typically, interhemispheric connectivity strengthens with age ( ;  ). In fact, RSN connectivity between homotopic regions is considered a ubiquitous feature of brain architecture ( ;  ). Our results may point toward a delayed pattern of maturation for children in the adversity group exhibited lower awFC than the healthy control children. However, interpretations of delayed maturation should be taken with caution as we did not explore longitudinal developmental trajectories in this study. Alterations in homotopic connectivity have been identified in various psychiatric conditions, and specifically in the superior temporal gyrus amongst individuals with depression ( ;  ). Alike other brain regions, the superior temporal gyrus is implicated in a multitude of processes including language development, emotional functioning, and social cognition. As such, atypical development involving this region (as seen when comparing adversity exposed children to healthy controls) may increase the risk for poor outcomes. For instance,   report that children raised in low SES environments demonstrated relatively smaller volumes in the left superior temporal gyrus, compared to their higher SES peers. It is suggested that protracted pruning allows for a period of prolonged plasticity which may be beneficial in higher SES environments ( ). Further, there is consistent evidence that socioeconomically deprived environments and the lack of access to consistent and responsive caregiving are associated with differences in the development of emotion processing and language-supporting brain regions ( ;  ). Similarly, our awFC results identified atypical development in the LIM among children exposed to perinatal maternal adversity. Crucially, the independent SC analysis did not identify significant differences in LIM connectivity between the adversity and control groups. However, by integrating SC in estimates of FC, the awFC method was able to capture important developmental changes related to interhemispheric connectivity in the LIM with a greater degree of sensitivity than FC alone. \n\nCollectively, we report that when examining the FPN and LIM the awFC method was more sensitive than separate FC and SC analyses in detecting connectivity differences. We suggest that it is promising to see that the awFC method identified differences in higher-order cognitive and emotion networks as they are commonly reported neural targets of adversity exposure ( ;  ;  ) identified in existing unimodal imaging research. \n\n\n### 5.2. Contrasting awFC between adversity and healthy control groups in the VAN \n  \nGreater FC in the VAN was identified for the adversity group compared to controls. This pattern was opposite to that observed in the other RSNs examined, where lower connectivity distinguished the adversity group from controls. Specifically, we found evidence of greater awFC within regions of the VAN (R aOFG and L LG/CU) among children whose mothers experienced perinatal adversity. Attention processing is associated with the engagement of two segregated functional networks—the DAN and the VAN—each subserving a specialized processing function ( ). The DAN is involved in goal-directed, top-down processing that maintains attention in the face of distracting stimuli ( ). Conversely, the VAN is characterized as a stimulus-driven, bottom-up system that orients attention to stimuli outside of the current focus ( ). Both networks interact to control which information is perceived and attended to  . For instance, a granger causality analysis of task-based fMRI revealed that signals from the DAN to the VAN work to filter out unimportant distractor stimuli while signals from the VAN to the DAN interrupts attention maintained by the DAN in order to facilitate the reorientation of attention to newly salient stimuli ( ). It has been observed that disruptions in the coupling of these networks results in attention deficits which underlie multiple psychopathologies ( ). While these networks are well-characterized in adult neuroimaging studies, there is minimal research focusing on their developmental trajectory, with less exploration into changes in within-network connectivity as compared to between-network investigations ( ). One study by   found that children exhibiting low VAN functional connectivity displayed an accelerated profile of cortical maturation which resembles adolescence and adulthood organization.   suggested that a decrease in VAN connectivity could signal the pruning of excessive/redundant connections to allow for more efficient information processing. However, both premature and delayed pruning may be consequential for future development. Furthermore, due to hierarchical nature of brain development, earlier maturing brain networks could shape the development of later developing cortical networks ( ;  ;  ). The VAN is an intermediary network that coordinates signals between primary unimodal and the association cortices ( ;  ;  ). As such, it is situated in a pivotal position to affect the development of multimodal association cortices which underlie higher-order cognitive functioning. Here, we observed greater connectivity in the VAN among the adversity group. While this finding will need to be replicated in a larger sample and explored across developmental timepoints, it suggests that altered VAN connectivity observed in association with maternal adversity may have knock-on effects that impact upon the consolidation of an adult-like functional cortical organization. \n\n\n### 5.3. Structural connectivity and FC decoupling \n  \nIn this study, we did not detect any differences in SC in the DMN, LIM, VAN, and DAN between healthy controls and children whose mothers experienced perinatal maternal adversity. Over development, synaptogenesis functions to increase the number of WM tracts while pruning decreases the number of these connections. It has been suggested that from age 2–7 years, the activity of these processes counterbalance one another resulting in a “plateau phase” ( ). Since the mean age of our sample was 7.63 years (  SD   = 0.66), it is possible that this feature might explain the lack of observable differences. Furthermore, WM maturation is driven by multiple processes. In this study, tract density was used as the metric for quantifying SC and therefore changes in myelination would not be detected by this approach. Accordingly, alterations SC may not be as easily identifiable during middle childhood in comparison to changes in FC. Developmental events such as pruning and myelination are also dependent on the network in question and vary in their timing and rate of change ( ;  ). Inter-subject variability in maturational trajectories may also contribute to the incongruent SC and FC findings. \n\n\n\n## 6. Limitations and future directions \n  \nOur research does have some important limitations which must be considered. First, owing to the loss of subjects due to movement during the scan, our sample size was small (17 participants). As such it will be important to replicate these findings in a larger sample. In addition, our study conceptualized maternal adversity as low SES and/or experiencing poor prenatal and/or postnatal maternal health (i.e., anxiety and/or depression). The field of adversity research continues to find optimal methods of measuring adversity exposure. The challenge may stem from the fact that adverse events co-occur, but each event can contribute to distinct neural outcomes ( ;  ). For example, living in low socioeconomic conditions is linked to an increased risk for abuse, lack of access to adequate healthcare, poor maternal mental health, etc. In a composite score, the specific effect of individual adverse experiences and their degree of severity would not be adequately represented in developmental outcomes. Furthermore, since our score measures maternal adversity across the perinatal period, we were unable to separate the independent impact of prenatal and postnatal exposures. Research efforts have suggested that prenatal and postnatal experiences do affect development in diverging ways, in addition to accounting for shared variance ( ;  ). Future investigations should continue to explore these relationships with consideration to different forms and severity of adversity exposure. \n\nAs this is the first study which has combined FC and SC using data fusion techniques to study developmental changes in middle childhood following perinatal maternal adversity exposures, comparing our results to the broader literature must be done with caution. Additional research using multimodal imaging would be beneficial for identifying whether accelerated vs. delayed maturation is dependent on imaging modality and level of analysis (e.g., ROI vs. network). \n\nWe used DTI-based tractography to identify white matter tracts. This method is highly prone to motion artifacts, inaccuracies and is unable to distinguish between the crossing, convergence, and divergence of fibers ( ). We collected 3 DTI scans in each participant, permitting us to drop whole scans and retain some data, if movement was an issue. In addition, the number of vectors sampled was different in each of these scans (19, 20, and 21) giving us a total of 60 directions and improved capacity to resolve crossing fibers. Of note, it has been observed that diffusion spectrum imaging is better able to detect fibers and fiber crossings ( ) and therefore may provide a better suited technique for future studies. \n\n\n## 7. Conclusion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first neuroimaging study which uses a combined data fusion structural-functional connectivity approach to explore the impact of perinatal maternal adversity on RSN development in middle childhood. We combine SC information from DTI with FC information from rs-fMRI to identify potential alterations in network connectivity within the VAN, DAN, DMN, FPN, and LIM upon perinatal adversity exposure. Our results indicated that there is a benefit of using an awFC approach as it is more sensitive in highlighting differences in connectivity in networks associated with higher-order cognitive and emotional processing (FPN and LIM) in comparison to independent FC and SC analyses. Furthermore, our awFC analysis suggests that poor maternal mental health and/or low SES during the perinatal period may be associated with greater awFC within the VAN. These results may suggest that it is possible for environmental perturbation in early life to recalibrate brain development in a way that facilitates survival within contexts of uncertainty and inconsistent caregiving. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in this study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the ethics approval was obtained from Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board and the Douglas Mental Health University Institute.

However, the neural biomarker of GCBT which could be used in clinic remains unclear. The temporal variability is a novel concept to characterize the dynamic functional connectivity (FC), which has many advantages as biomarker. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the potential difference of temporal variability between asthmatic patients and healthy controls, then determine the different patterns of temporal variability between pre- and post-treatment group and reveal the relationship between the variability and the symptoms improvement reduced by GCBT. \n\n Methods:   At baseline, 40 asthmatic patients and 40 matched controls received resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans and clinical assessments. After 8 weeks of GCBT treatment, 17 patients received fMRI scans, and assessments again. Temporal variability at baseline and post-treatment were calculated for further analysis. \n\n Results:   Compared with controls, asthmatic patients showed widespread decreases in temporal variability. Moreover, the variability in both right caudate and left putamen were positively correlated with asthma control level. After GCBT, asthma control level and depression of patients were improved. Meanwhile, compared with pre-GCBT, patients after treatment showed lower variability in left opercular of Rolandic, right parahippocampal gyrus and right lingual gyrus, as well as higher variability in left temporal pole. Variability in regions which were found abnormal at baseline did not exhibit significant differences between post-GCBT and controls. \n\n Conclusions:   Asthma-specific changes of dynamic functional connectivity may serve as promising underpinnings of GCBT for asthma. \n\n Clinical Trial Registration:  , identifier: Chi-CTR-15007442. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAsthma is a common disorder with a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders ( ). There are almost 300 million asthmatic patients all over the world to the end of 2012 ( ). The increasing trends may be associated with the changes in environment pollutions ( ), lifestyle and rapid urbanization ( ). Moreover, psychiatric comorbidities are increasingly recognized as important determinants of asthma management and prognosis, as they are involved in undesirable disease control and poor quality of life ( – ). The highest prevalence, comorbidities and bad managements contribute to high costs for the society. Given that even small reductions in psychiatric comorbidities and small improvements in asthma management have a greater public health benefit than treating those who are already symptomatic or always recurring, more effort should be targeted toward developing, evaluating, and implementing interventions for asthma-related education and negative emotions. \n\nRecent research consistently demonstrated that group cognitive behavior therapy (GCBT) can encourage asthmatic patients to accept their problems, keep control of their symptoms and medications, and alleviate asthma-related emotional symptoms ( – ). Our previous studies demonstrated that GCBT is a successful psychotherapy in improving the asthma-related symptoms ( ,  ). However, the therapeutic mechanism of GCBT remains unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques provide the opportunities to investigate the neural underpinnings of psychotherapy. Previous studies reported the recovered effects of GCBT for asthma ( ,  ), depression ( ,  ), and anxiety ( – ), while consistent findings are not confirmed. \n\nTemporal variability is a novel concept to quantitatively characterize the dynamic functional connectivity (FC) from the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals ( ). This metric can obtain the stability or flexibility of the regional network within a specific time window. Accumulating evidence indicates that temporal variability can be used to explain intra-subject variability in diseases and considered as a biomarker related to treatment response ( ,  ). For example, Huang et al. ( ) observed a global reduction in the temporal variability, local, and distant brain signal synchronization for subjects during anesthesia. Hou et al. ( ) found that increased temporal variability of the striatum region predicted early antidepressant response in patients with major depressive disorder. As alluded to before, resting FC in GCBT has been studied widely in recent years ( ,  ), but similar research on dynamic FC has been quite scarce. \n\nAccordingly, to find the effective neuroimaging biomarkers of GCBT which can be used in clinic, the aim of this study was to find the asthma specific features of temporal variability by analyzing the BOLD data of asthmatic patients and healthy controls, then determine the different patterns of temporal variability between pre- and post-GCBT patients and reveal the relationships between variability and clinical symptoms changed by GCBT. We hypothesized that asthmatic patients might show distinctive temporal variability characteristics, and GCBT could improve the clinical symptoms by regulating abnormal temporal variability. \n\n\n## Methods and Materials \n  \n### Participants and Evaluations \n  \nForty patients with a diagnosis of bronchial asthma without acute attacks and 40 age-, gender- and education level-matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited. All participants underwent an MRI scan with the same imaging parameter. Patients also received a series of clinical assessments including a 17-item Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD), Chinese-version short health anxiety inventory (CSHAI) and asthma control test (ACT) ( ). In addition, there were 17 patients who completed GCBT treatment. They also received the above assessments after GCBT. The contents of GCBT were reported in our previous study, which consisted of 8 sessions ( ). This study was approved by the recommendations of the ethics committee (Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, No. 2016ZDSYLL004.0) with written informed consent from all subjects. It is in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. The clinical trial registration number is Chi-CTR-15007442. \n  \nThe demographics and clinical scales. \n  \n Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation  , \n\n HC, healthy controls; ACT, asthma control test; CSHAI, Chinese-version short healthy anxiety inventory; HAMD, Hamilton depression rating scale; GCBT, group cognitive behavior therapy  . \n  \nParticipants were all right-handed and had at least 6 years of education, with ages ranging from 18 to 65 years. They had no electronic and metal equipment in their bodies (such as cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, stent). Patients met the diagnostic criteria of bronchial asthma and during non-attacks. Participants were excluded if (1) they suffered from other serious disease of respiratory system; (2) presented with mental disorders and alcohol and drug dependence; (3) had a history of organic brain disorders and cardio, hepatic, renal abnormality; (4) were women during pregnancy or lactation. \n\n\n### Brain Image Acquisition \n  \nMRI studies were performed on a 3-Tesla Scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a homogeneous birdcage head coil. All the subjects were scanned with high resolutional three dimensional T1 weighted imaging and resting state fMRI. The T1 weighted images were obtained using magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequences with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 1,900 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.48 ms, flip angle (FA) = 9°, acquisition matrix = 256 × 256, field of view (FOV) = 250 × 250 mm , thickness = 1.0 mm, gap = 0, slice = 176. An 8 min resting state fMRI was acquired with using a gradient -recalled echo-planar imaging pulse sequence the following parameters: TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 25 ms, FA = 90°, acquisition matrix = 64 × 64; FOV = 240 × 240 mm ; thickness = 3.0 mm; gap = 0 mm; 36 axial slices; 240 volumes; 3.75 × 3.75 mm  in-plane resolution parallel to the anterior-posterior commissure line. Participants lay supine with the head snugly fixed by a belt and foam pads to minimize head motion, and were required to keep their eyes closed, stay awake, and not think of specific things during scanning. \n\n\n### Functional Imaging Preprocessing \n  \nAll the resting state fMRI data were preprocessed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State Function (DPARSF 2.3 Advanced Edition) toolkit. For each subject, the first ten frames were discarded for magnetic saturation. The following steps were performed: (1) slice timing correction; (2) motion correction; (3) co-registering T1 to functional image; (4) spatial normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute space; (5) spatial smoothing using a 6 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel; (6) linear detrend; (7) regression of nuisance signals (white matter, cerebrospinal fluid signals and global signal), and the head-motion parameters; (8) temporal band-passing (0.01~0.08 Hz) to minimize low-frequency drift and filtering the high-frequency noise. \n\n\n### Temporal Variability of Functional Network \n  \nTemporal variability was performed to capture the dynamic functional network for all the subjects from the patients and controls. The main procedure of the temporal variability calculation is illustrated in  . First of all, time courses were averaged in each of brain regions with the selected parcellation, shown as  . The anatomical automatic labeling atlas-90 (AAL-90) was utilized to parcellate the brain, which comprised of 45 cortical and subcortical nodes (i.e., brain regions) in each hemisphere. Secondly, the entire time courses were segmented into several non-overlapping windows with a specific temporal length, shown as  . The length of window was set ranging from 42 s to 60 s, which has been demonstrated to obtain robust brain connectivity results, and to sufficiently capture the dynamic features ( ). Thirdly, for each subject, functional connectivity was obtained for each window by computing Pearson correlation between each brain region, shown as  . Finally, temporal variability was obtained for each brain region by calculating the variability of the functional architecture, shown as  . The functional architecture of a brain region k at a time window n is defined as the overall functional connectivity between current region k and other regions. The temporal variability of a region k is 1 minus the mean values of correlations of functional architectures among different windows for the current region ( ). The value of temporal variability can range from 0 to 2. A larger value represents a high temporal variability for the brain region. To avoid the arbitrary choice of window length, the temporal variability was calculated in different length of temporal windows, which ranged from 21 to 30 volumes. The final temporal variability was achieved by calculating the average values in different lengths of windows for each node of all the subjects. We can get a temporal variability value for each brain region of each subject. Therefore, a total of 90 temporal variability values was obtained for each subject in both patients and controls. \n  \nThe main procedure of the temporal variability analysis.

Independent two-sample   t  -test, Chi-square test, paired   t  -test and Pearson's correlation analysis were used to determine significant differences in demographic data, clinical scale scores, and temporal variability values. For comparisons of age, HAMD scores, ACT scores, CSHAI scores and temporal variability, differences between patients pre-GCBT and controls, as well as patients post-GCBT and controls were determined by two-sample   t  -test. The difference of gender was revealed by Chi-square test. The relationships between clinical features (depression severity, asthma control level, health anxiety level and symptoms reduction rate) and temporal variability were analyzed by Pearson's correlation analysis.   P   < 0.05 (uncorrected) was considered to indicate statistical significance. \n\n\n### Intervention \n  \nThe content of GCBT for asthma included eight sessions, with each session lasting ~60 min weekly. Each group consisted of 6–8 patients. The detailed treatment strategies are described in our previous study ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Data \n  \nThe detailed demographic and clinical information were showed in  . There were no significant differences of age, gender, and education between asthmatic patients and HC. The HAMD scores of patients were significantly higher than controls (  P   < 0.001). After GCBT treatment, ACT scores (  P   < 0.001) were higher than before, while HAMD scores were lower (  P   < 0.001). Moreover, no significant difference was found in HAMD scores between patients post-GCBT and controls (  P   = 0.055). \n\n\n### Comparisons of Temporal Variability \n  \nTo identify asthma-specific changes, a whole-brain temporal variability analysis was performed in asthmatic patients by comparing them to controls at baseline. We note that more than 15% of brain regions (  N   = 13) showed lower temporal variability in asthma (  and  ) (all   P   < 0.05), including right orbital part of superior frontal (AAL 6), right supplemental motor area (SMA, AAL 20), left olfactory (AAL 21), left calcarine cortex (AAL 43), right calcarine (AAL 44), left lingual gyrus (AAL 47), left inferior occipital gyrus (AAL 53), left fusiform gyrus (AAL 55), left superior parietal gyrus (AAL 59), left paracentral lobule (AAL 69), right paracentral lobule (AAL70), right caudate (AAL 72) and left putamen (AAL 73). While variability increased mainly in left angular gyrus (AAL 65). When the functional architecture of a given region shows high correlation across different time windows, or the dynamical functional connectivity time series exhibit high synchronization between the region of interest and other regions, the temporal variability will be low ( ). On the contrary, temporal variability will be high when the dynamical functional connectivity time series between the given region and other regions are independent ( ). \n  \n (A,B)   The comparisons of temporal variability between asthmatic patients and controls in the right and left cerebral hemisphere, respectively (  P   < 0.05,   P   < 0.01).

While higher temporal variability in the left temporal pole was also found in the patients after treatment (AAL 83) (  P   < 0.05) ( ,  ). \n  \nThe comparisons of temporal variability between asthmatic patients pre- and post-GCBT (  P   < 0.05,   P   < 0.01).

There was no significant difference in variability between them in the right orbital superior frontal gyrus (AAL 6), right SMA (AAL 20), left olfactory (AAL 21), left calcarine (AAL 43), left inferior occipital gyrus (AAL 53), left superior parietal gyrus (AAL 59), left angular (AAL 65), and right paracentral lobule (AAL 70) ( ,  ). It means that GCBT may improve the clinical symptoms by reversing the variability in the above brain regions. \n  \nThe comparisons of temporal variability between asthmatic patients post-GCBT and controls.

No statistically significant correlation was found between temporal variability and clinical symptom improvement (HAMD, ACT, and CSHAI reduction rate). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, differences of temporal variability between asthmatic patients and controls, as well as between pre- and post-GCBT were comprehensively investigated. The clinical relevance of temporal variability was also examined. Compared to controls, asthmatic patients showed lower temporal variability in parts of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), visual network and sensorimotor cortex, which were generally correlated with asthma control level. Notably, after GCBT, patients exhibited treatment-specific changes of variability in the regions which have no differences between asthma and controls at baseline. \n\n### Asthma-Specific Changes of Variability \n  \nPrevious studies of resting-state FC ( ,  ,  ) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) ( ) analysis have revealed changes in the intrinsic topographical organization of the brain in asthma. However, time-varying properties of the brain in asthma have not been investigated. This study detected asthma-specific changes of variability, which may provide the evidence to further understand the neuroimaging underpinnings of asthma. \n\nThe orbital part of the superior frontal gyrus is part of the OFC, which is involved in sensory integration ( ). In terms of anatomical structure, the OFC connects with many critical cortices, including motor, sensory, and some regions of limbic system. The extensive connections between OFC and other regions indicated the complex functions of it ( ). In 1987, Marks et al. ( ) have demonstrated that OFC is involved in respiratory phase switching, and it influences the brain stem structures during rapid-eye-movement sleep. In line with this finding, asthmatic patients showed decreased variability in OFC. Therefore, we inferred that the lower variability in OFC would be also associated with the aberrant respiratory in asthma. Meanwhile, variability in visual network (i.e., calcarine, lingual gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus) of asthmatic patients was also lower than of controls. Physiologically, the visual cortex is associated with selective attention, which can be readily captured by salient emotional distractors ( ). In particular, asthmatic patients tend to exhibit depressive emotion. These studies indicated that the decreased variability of the visual network may reflect the attentional biases of negative emotions in asthma. For example, Li et al. ( ) have demonstrated that the widespread decreased regional function in visual network is the core change which is influenced by asthma. Thus, abnormal variability in the visual network may be an asthma-specific characteristic, especially the key changes involved in emotional biases in asthma. \n\nIt seems that breathing is so simple, yet taking a breath is a complex motor function, which is associated with the coordination of neural activation of many brain regions ( ). Movement-activity was more frequent in the supplemental motor area (SMA), and its onset is often time locked to the movement onset ( ). Kojima et al. ( ) investigated the changes of hemoglobin levels in SMA during cardiopulmonary exercise test, and they found that total hemoglobin of SMA increased at respiratory compensation in healthy people. This means that the asthmatic patients with decompensated respiration would present abnormal function in SMA which is influenced by abnormal hemoglobin levels. As an important node of the motor network, the SMA is involved in the lower arterial oxygen saturation ( ). Decreased FC between the right and left motor cortex was found in the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ( ). Similar to COPD, airflow obstruction is also a critical symptom of asthma. Thus, we inferred that the lower variability in SMA would also be caused by oxygen desaturation related to asthma. Identical to SMA, the paracentral lobule plays an important role in the processing of sensory airway ( ). A previous study reported that COPD patients showed decreased activity in the right paracentral lobule, right SMA, left fusiform gyrus, and left putamen ( ), which gave powerful evidence to our study. \n\nThe left angular gyrus, as the key node of the default mode network (DMN) ( ), showed an increased variability in patients in the current study. Previous studies suggested that asthmatic patients have reduced gray matter volume ( ) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation ( ) in the left angular gyrus. However, the changes of these regional abnormalities are independent ( ). Thus, higher variability of left angular gyrus would also indicate low functionality, which may underlie the asthma-related emotional processing. \n\n\n### GCBT-Specific Changes of Clinical Symptoms and Variability \n  \nThe comparison of temporal variability between pre- and post-GCBT revealed altered variability in subcortical regions and increased variability in the left temporal pole. Rolandic operculum is related to respiratory processing ( ). For example, higher FC between Rolandic operculum and right insula was found in soldiers who experienced hypoxia-reoxygenation, which suggested that the level of oxygen would lead to the changes of neuronal activity ( ). This conclusion can be used to explain the altered brain functions in asthma, patients experience hypoxia during asthma attack and reoxygenation after attack. In addition, parahippocampus has a potential respiratory effect ( ). For example, patients with obstructive sleep apnoea exhibited fluctuations of BOLD signal intensity in the right parahippocampus, while signal intensity was reduced after positive airway pressure ( ). Thus, we inferred that the temporal variability, which was computed by BOLD signal, in the right parahippocampus would be changed accompanied with the changes of oxygen level. \n\nThe temporal variability of the Rolandic operculum and right parahippocampus were reduced after GCBT, which may reflect the therapeutic effect of GCBT for abnormal respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, abnormal variability in regions of the sensorimotor cortex were recovered after GCBT. It was consistent with previous studies, demonstrating the therapeutic mechanism of GCBT ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Relationship Between Variability and Clinical Symptoms \n  \nPositive correlations between ACT scores and variability values in the right caudate and left putamen were found in the current study. Caudate is a critical node associated with cognitive function, and links to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex via the network ( ,  ). It is widely recognized that mood can affect cognition ( ), and negative emotional symptoms are highly prevalent in asthmatic patients. However, we did not collect the cognitive information. Meanwhile, one novel study demonstrated that increased IL-6 is negatively correlated with a lower BOLD signal in caudate ( ), supporting the hypothesis that inflammation in asthma may contribute to the functional changes in caudate. Asthma control level can directly impact on asthma attack (i.e., inflammation level). Therefore, we inferred that the decreased temporal variability in the right caudate was associated with the level of inflammation. \n\nPrevious research has shown that putamen is involved in sensorimotor activity ( ), suggesting an important role in gating respiratory information ( ). Consistent with our study, Marchi et al. ( ) reported that mean oxygen saturation during sleep is correlated with the volume of left putamen. Asthma often attacks during sleep, with a great influence on the oxygen saturation. Increased variability in the left putamen was correlated with the ACT scores, strengthening the hypothesis that asthma control level directly impacts on BOLD signal. \n\nIt should be mentioned that this study comes with a few limitations. First, the patients recruited were treated with different types of antiasthmatics, so the outcome cannot be attributed to a specific antiasthmatic. Second, the sample size studied was relatively small, the complexity of GCBT warrants larger sample sizes to explain the underpinnings more fully. Furthermore, asthma-related physiological index (e.g., inflammation and lung function) and cognitive function were not assessed in this work. However, a number of recent works have found that the global signal was highly related the brain connectivity and individual difference in behavioral phenotypes ( ,  ), we did not regress the respiratory signal in this study. A combination of physiological index, cognition and temporal variability may provide better understanding of the potential mechanisms of asthma and GCBT responses. \n\nIn conclusion, we provide the evidence for the widely decreased temporal variability in asthmatic patients. Moreover, the variability in the caudate and putamen exhibited significant correlations with asthma control level. Specifically, the abnormal dynamic FC could be recovered by successful GCBT. Taken together, these findings indicated that asthma-specific changes of temporal variability may serve as promising underpinnings of GCBT for asthma. \n\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University.

Acupuncture is considered a good alternative therapy for PDM. However, the central mechanism of the analgesic effect of acupuncture is largely unknown. In this study, eligible patients were randomized into the real and sham acupuncture groups using a computer-generated, permuted block randomization method. The study cohort comprised 34 patients: 19 in the real acupuncture group and 15 in the sham acupuncture group. The clinical characteristics of the patients during their menstrual period were collected, and imaging scans were performed during the first 3 days of the patients’ menstrual period. We analyzed task and resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to investigate the potential central mechanism of the immediate effect of acupuncture intervention on the intensity of PDM pain. The task fMRI study found that the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and right supplemental motor area were activated during real acupuncture. Using the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) method, we found a post- versus pre-treatment change in the FC of the rACC and left precentral gyrus in the comparison of real acupuncture versus sham acupuncture. In addition, the FC of the rACC–left precentral gyrus at baseline was negatively correlated with short-term analgesia, while the change in the FC of the rACC–left precentral gyrus was positively correlated with short-term analgesia after acupuncture treatment. These findings support the importance of rACC–left precentral gyrus resting-state FC in the modulation of the intensity of PDM pain through acupuncture, which may shed light on the central mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of PDM. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPrimary dysmenorrhea (PDM) is a common gynecological disease characterized by pain in the lower abdomen ( ). The onset of PDM often occurs at the age of 20 years or younger after the ovulatory cycle becomes established ( ). PDM reportedly affects 45–95% of menstruating women, and severe episodes affect 10–25% of reproductive-aged women ( ). PDM has become the main cause of recurrent absenteeism in young women during their menstrual period ( ). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral contraceptives are widely used in the treatment of PDM ( ). However, these standard drugs have a poor therapeutic effect and are associated with adverse effects ( ;  ;  ). Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify a safe and effective method with which to manage the symptoms of PDM. \n\nRecently, acupuncture has been considered a good alternative therapy for PDM in patients who fail to respond to oral analgesic drugs ( ). A series of clinical studies have confirmed the beneficial effect of acupuncture in improving pain due to PDM ( ;  ;  ). In addition, a meta-analysis reported that acupoint stimulation has more significant effects on PDM than non-acupoint stimulation ( ). Moreover, studies on the analgesic effect of single acupoint stimulation have proved that acupuncture at Sanyinjiao (SP6) effectively relieves dysmenorrhea ( ;  ), especially resulting in an immediate effect in PDM ( ;  ;  ). However, the underlying mechanism by which acupuncture exerts an immediate analgesic effect in patients with PDM remains unclear. \n\nIn recent years, neuroimaging techniques have been extensively used to investigate the mechanism by which acupuncture achieves analgesia. A large number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated that the analgesic effect of acupuncture may be related to the responses of pain-related brain regions ( ;  ;  ). Moreover, the analgesic mechanism of acupuncture in PDM is related to the regulation of endogenous opioids in the pain modulation system and pain-related brain network ( ). Thus, the probable mechanism of the immediate analgesic effect of acupuncture in PDM is via modulation of the brain regions related to pain. \n\nThe acupuncture process is complicated, and task-state fMRI studies have found that twirling acupuncture manipulation at real and sham acupoints results in different activation effects on the cerebral cortex in healthy people ( ;  ). However, it is unclear whether this difference affects the outcome of acupuncture in patients with PDM. To investigate this, we used a block design to divide patients into groups that underwent acupuncture at real or sham acupoints × twirling acupuncture and retention acupuncture. Task-state fMRI was utilized to verify whether the immediate analgesic effect and brain response to twirling acupuncture differed between acupuncture modalities (needling at acupoints or non-acupoints). Furthermore, we used resting-state fMRI to examine the effects of acupuncture on the functional connectivity (FC) of different brain areas and to identify whether the changes in brain FC could be used to evaluate changes in clinical pain intensity. We hypothesized that the combined task- and resting-state brain function data would result in different central response characteristics due to acupoint and non-acupoint stimulation under different needle manipulation techniques, thus explaining part of the central mechanism of the immediate analgesic effect of acupuncture in PDM. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Patients \n  \nForty-four patients with PDM were recruited. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) right-handed nulliparous women aged 18–30 years; (2) meeting the diagnostic criteria for PDM of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada ( ); (3) normal menstrual cycle (27 to 32 days); (4) fulfillment of a menstrual cycle dysmenorrhea diary; (5) average pain intensity score of ≥4 on a visual analog scale (VAS) for three consecutive menstrual cycles; (6) fMRI scan performed on days 1–3 of menstruation and a VAS pain score of ≥ 4 before the scan; and (7) responsive to acupuncture and able to attain the feeling of   De qi  . The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) dysmenorrhea caused by organic gynecological disease; (2) history of cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular diseases and/or neuropsychiatric disorders; (3) intake of painkillers or sedatives within 1 week before the fMRI scan; (4) contraindications to fMRI. All patients provided written informed consent for study participation. The study was approved by the Sichuan Traditional Chinese Medicine Regional Ethics Review Committee before trial commencement. Nine patients dropped out during the follow-up period. A final total of 34 patients (19 in the real acupuncture group and 15 in the sham acupuncture group) completed all the clinical assessments and imaging scans and received 8 weeks of real or sham acupuncture treatment. \n\nPatients were instructed to take no analgesics other than ibuprofen during the study period. Participants were permitted to take ibuprofen sustained-release capsules (  Tianjin Smith Kline & French laboratories, Ltd., Tianjin, China; SFDA approval number: H20013062  ) as rescue medicine for unbearable menstrual cramps; the details, including dosage, medication time, and remission time were reported to the researchers and recorded in the case report form. \n\n#### Randomization and Blinding \n  \nEligible patients were randomized into the real and sham acupuncture groups using a computer-generated, permuted block randomization method. Because of the particularities of acupuncture, it is difficult to achieve blinding. To minimize the influences of subjective factors from participants and researchers on the research results, we blinded the patients, assessors, and statisticians to the groupings. \n\n\n#### Data Acquisition \n  \n##### Demographic and clinical data \n  \nThe patients’ baseline demographic data (age, height, weight, and disease duration) were collected. VAS scores were recorded before and after the fMRI scan to evaluate the degree of dysmenorrhea immediately before and after acupuncture. \n\n\n##### fMRI scan procedure \n  \nThe study was performed in the MRI room of the Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University of TCM. The fMRI scan was acquired using a 3.0-T GE Signa MR750 system (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, United States). All patients were scanned within the first 3 days of their menstrual period. Patients were instructed not to drink strong tea, coffee, or alcohol for 24 h before the MRI scan. After a 20-min break, the patients entered the MRI room in a calm state. Patients were asked to keep their eyes closed and remain awake but avoid psychological activity as much as possible during the scanning process. A head restraint was used to limit head movement, and earplugs were provided to reduce the noise. \n\nThe three scanning steps in turn were T1-weighted gradient-echo imaging, rest 1, and rest 2. High-resolution T1-weighted gradient-echo images were obtained for anatomical reference using the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2530 mm, echo time (TE) = 3.39 ms, field of view (FOV) = 256 mm × 256 mm, flip angle = 7°, slice thickness = 1 mm, resolution = 256 × 256. The resting-state functional images were obtained using an echo-planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, FOV = 240 mm × 240 mm, flip angle = 90°, slice thickness = 4 mm, resolution = 64 × 64. \n\n\n##### Acupuncture procedure \n  \nAfter the first two scans (T1-weighted gradient-echo imaging and rest 1), the scanning was suspended and patients were instructed to keep their whole body still, especially the head. Patients then received acupuncture at the corresponding acupoints or non-acupoints in accordance with their grouping. The following two types of conditions were applied: bilateral SP6 stimulation, and stimulation at a non-acupoint (without known clinical effects) located midway between SP6 and the Urinary Bladder Meridian. The patients had not previously received acupuncture and could not distinguish which acupoints were being stimulated. Needles were perpendicularly inserted to a depth of 1–1.5 cun. The acupuncturists twirled the needles bidirectionally from 90° to 180° to induce the   De qi   sensation. The duration of acupuncture was 7 min, during which the needles were retained and twisted alternately. The time at which the needles were inserted was designated as “0.” The needles were inserted at 1, 3, 5, and 7 min, twirled at 2, 4, and 6 min (at a rate of approximately 120 times per minute), and then left in place at the end of 7 min ( ). After the completion of acupuncture, the rest 2 scan was performed with the needles retained. The whole process was continuous. The procedure was performed by licensed and experienced acupuncturists. The disposable stainless steel acupuncture needles did not cause any safety problems under the nuclear magnetic environment. \n  \nSchematic diagram of the fMRI experimental process.   (A)   Structural-image scan (T1), function-image scan (rest1, rest2, and task), the paradigm of intervention (acupuncture), and evaluation of pain intensity (VAS-A and VAS-B).   (B)   In the task-state scanning, the acupuncture operation of the twirling and retention were performed alternately, with each condition for 1 min, and the total operating time lasted 7 min. \n  \n\n\n#### Statistical Analysis \n  \nAll statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics V21.0. Continuous variables with normal distribution were presented as the mean and standard deviation. The significance level used for statistical analysis with two-tailed testing was 5%. For normally distributed quantitative data, the   t   test was used to detect differences between the real and sham acupuncture groups; the Mann–Whitney test was used for non-normally distributed data. To explore the effect of acupuncture on analgesia, the two-sample   t   test was used to compare the pre- to post-treatment change in pain intensity (VAS score) between the real and sham acupuncture groups. \n\n\n#### fMRI Data Preprocessing and Analysis \n  \nAll fMRI data were preprocessed using the Matlab toolkit SPM8 . To maintain the stability of the data, the images from the first five time points were discarded during data preprocessing. Then, all the scanned images were aligned with the middle image and corrected. When the head movement was corrected, the images with a head movement angle of greater than 2 mm or 2° in any direction were deleted. For spatial registration, T1-weighted images of the patients were matched with their respective functional images, and the images were uniformly segmented and resampled. The retained data were processed with spatial normalization based on the Montreal Neurological Institute space. Finally, the images were smoothed spatially with a Gaussian kernel at a full width at half maximum of 6 mm. \n\nFirst, the one-sample   t   test was used to obtain the brain activity of each patient under each condition (real-twirling, real-retention, sham-twirling, and sham-retention). Second, the paired   t   test was used to obtain the fMRI signal change differences between the twirling and retention conditions within the same group. Third, a 2 × 2 analysis of variance was performed to compare the twirling and retention fMRI signal changes between the real and sham acupuncture groups (full factorial analysis in SPM8 second-level analysis) to yield an interest mask of the associated brain regions ( ). A voxel-wise threshold of   p   < 0.005 with a false discovery rate-corrected cluster level of   p   < 0.05 was applied in the task fMRI analysis; a small volume correction was used to correct for multiple comparisons using 3dClustSim (voxel level,   p   < 0.005; cluster level,   p   < 0.05) if the affected brain regions belonged to the pain matrix. \n\n\n#### Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nBased on the region of interest as the seed point, seed-based FC was assessed in the resting-state fMRI scans during the pre- and post-treatment phases. Pearson correlation analysis was used to calculate the correlation (  r   value) between the seed region and each region of the brain. The   r   value was then converted into a   Z   value close to the normal distribution via Fisher   Z   transformation to represent the strength of the connection between the two brain regions. \n\n\n#### Correlation Analysis \n  \nTo investigate the correlation between the intergroup difference in the FC change (post- versus pre-treatment) and the short-term analgesic effect of acupuncture, we explored the potential correlation between the FC in characteristic brain regions and the VAS score based on Pearson’s correlation coefficient. We also explored the correlation between the brain areas activated under task-state fMRI and short-term analgesia. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Patient Characteristics \n  \nA total of 34 patients completed this trial, comprising 19 in the real acupuncture group and 15 in the sham acupuncture group. The demographic data of all patients are shown in  . There were no significant differences between the two groups in age, height, weight, and disease duration (  p   > 0.05). \n  \nBaseline patient characteristics and average pain intensity before and after acupuncture treatment. \n    \nThe pre- and post-treatment VAS scores of the real and sham acupuncture groups are shown in  . There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the pre-treatment VAS score (  p   = 0.493) and post-treatment VAS score (  p   = 0.069), but the reduction in the pain intensity after treatment was significantly greater in the real acupuncture group than the sham acupuncture group. Furthermore, the pain intensity change [(post-treatment VAS score minus pre-treatment VAS score)/pre-treatment VAS score] was significantly greater in the real acupuncture group than the sham acupuncture group (  p   = 0.010). \n\n#### Brain Region Activity \n  \n summarizes the task-state fMRI results that show the brain activity in each group and the intergroup differences in brain activity under each condition.   shows the brain areas with no activity under different conditions in the real and sham acupuncture groups. The real acupuncture group showed no significant brain activity in the needle retention state, while bilateral thalamus activation was found in the needle twirling state; a comparison of the two conditions (retention versus twirling) revealed that the signal change occurred in the right supplemental motor area (SMA) of the brain. The sham acupuncture group showed brain activity in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) under both the retention and twirling states, with no difference in the activated brain area under the retention versus the twirling state. Under the retention condition, the brain activity significantly differed between the real and sham acupuncture groups in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right precuneus (PCU), right SMA, and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG); under the twirling condition, the brain regions with significantly different activity in the real acupuncture group versus the sham acupuncture group were the right PCU and the ACC ( ). Notably, the ACC and PCU are the core nodes of the default mode network (DMN). The brain regions where the activity changes under the two conditions (retention versus twirling) differed between the real and sham acupuncture groups were the rostral ACC (rACC) and the right SMA ( ). In addition, there was a significant positive activity change in the rACC under the twirling versus the retention condition between the real and sham acupuncture groups. \n  \nTask state-related brain activity in each group and intergroup activity differences under each condition. \n      \nBrain negative activity in different conditions in each group.

After calculating the resting-state FC, we found a significant pre- versus post-treatment difference in the FC between the rACC and the left precentral gyrus in the real acupuncture group versus the sham acupuncture group ( ). The resting-state scan showed that the FC of the rACC–left precentral gyrus at baseline was negatively correlated with the short-term analgesic effect based on the VAS pain score (  r   = −0.369,   p   = 0.041), while a positive correlation was observed between the change in FC of the rACC–left precentral gyrus and the short-term analgesic effect based on the VAS score (  r   = 0.542,   p   = 0.002) ( ). \n  \nThe seed-based functional connectivity results and clinical significance.

(B)   The FC of rACC-Precentral.L in the baseline was negatively correlated with the short-time pain analgesia, while the change of FC in rACC-Precentral.L was positively correlated with the short-time pain analgesia in PDM patients after acupuncture treatment.

The DMN contributed greatly in the process of acupuncture. In addition, the pain intensity (scored by the VAS) was related to central features on resting-state fMRI. Our results suggest that the analgesic mechanism of acupuncture may be strongly linked to the FC of the rACC–left precentral gyrus. \n\n### Task-State-Related Brain Activity in Each Group and Intergroup Differences in Brain Activity Under Each Condition \n  \nOur task-state fMRI results showed that the right SMA, right thalamus, and right SFG were activated under the twirling condition of acupuncture. The SMA plays a pivotal role in the translation of pain cognition ( ); it expresses more significant regional cerebral blood flow under different pain modalities and is considered a potential biomarker of acute pain ( ). The brain response in the SMA is reportedly correlated with reduced pain following acupuncture stimulation ( ), suggesting that the SMA may mediate the signal transmission of acupuncture analgesia. Our study revealed deactivations in the SMA under the twirling acupuncture condition, which is in line with fMRI studies reporting that the SMA has decreased activity during acupuncture or transcranial stimulation ( ;  ). \n\nSeveral studies have reported thalamus-related abnormal FC in PDM ( ;  ). The thalamus, as part of the medial pain system, is significantly activated in response to the pain signal produced by painful stimuli ( ), which is mainly transmitted by the ascending pain pathway, and participates in the learning of the pain-related emotional response during the process of pain coding ( ). The activation of the thalamus is positively correlated with the acupuncture-induced analgesic effect ( ;  ). We speculate that this analgesic effect of acupuncture may be linked to the limbic–paralimbic–neocortical network modulation involving the thalamus ( ). Moreover, the right SFG was activated by twirling acupuncture in the sham acupuncture group. This might be a result of the “placebogenic” effect of stimulation at non-acupuncture points ( ), which occurs due to the unspecific effects of sham acupuncture ( ). Overall, the evidence suggests that the central analgesic effect of twirling acupuncture may be associated with mediation of the pain-related regions of the brain. \n\nThe present study found that the brain activity differed between the real and sham acupuncture groups in the ACC, right PCU, right SMA/SFG, and right MFG/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The ACC and PCU are the two core areas of the DMN ( ). Multiple fMRI studies have confirmed the presence of DMN-related abnormalities in PDM, involving structural abnormalities and aberrant intrinsic brain activities ( ;  ;  ). Moreover, one tract-based analysis reported that the disruption of communication within the DMN and/or between the DMN and other pain-related brain networks induced by altered anatomical connections may be the central susceptibility leading to the progression of PDM into chronicity ( ). A review focused on the central effects of acupuncture-induced analgesia indicated that the FC and activation pattern of the DMN are influenced by analgesic acupuncture ( ). Previous studies observed that patients with PDM have abnormal brain activity in the ACC, which might be associated with the PDM-related disturbance in pain modulation ( ;  ;  ). Negative activation of the ACC inhibits the pain-related emotional response under the action of acupuncture ( ), which proves that the ACC is an important brain region involved in acupuncture-induced analgesia. The PCU modulates chronic pain ( ) and acts on the autonomic nerve and descending inhibition systems to regulate the pain sensation caused by acute noxious stimulation ( ). Abnormal changes in gray matter volume are observed in the PCU of patients with PDM ( ;  ;  ). Moreover, patients with PDM have increased FC ( ) and spontaneous brain activity ( ) in the PCU, and acupuncture treatment significantly regulates this abnormal brain functional network connection ( ). In addition, the SMA, SFG, right MFG, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were activated under task-state fMRI in the present study. The fMRI activation is more extensive in discriminative somatosensory and cognitive pain processing areas during verum acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture ( ). \n\n\n### Rostral Anterior Cingulate Cortex–Left Precentral Gyrus Functional Connectivity \n  \nA resting-state fMRI study confirmed the presence of abnormal ACC-related systematic FC in PDM-related disturbances ( ). Furthermore, ACC-related resting-state FC is more prone to occur in women than men ( ). In the present study, we found that real acupuncture significantly decreased the resting-state FC between the rACC and left precentral gyrus compared with sham acupuncture. The rACC mainly modulates internal pain responsiveness ( ) and has been suggested to be involved in the FC within the mesocorticolimbic pathways encoding the effects of expectancy on pain ( ). The precentral gyrus contributes to the provision of pain relief ( ). An arterial spin labeling study reported aberrant precentral gyrus activity in patients with PDM ( ). Thus, a reduction in the rACC–left precentral gyrus resting-state FC may be the mechanism by which acupuncture affects pain modulation. \n\n\n### Correlations Between the Rostral Anterior Cingulate Cortex–Left Precentral Gyrus Functional Connectivity and Pain Intensity \n  \nIn this study, we combined task-state and resting-state fMRI data to identify the mechanism of the immediate effect of acupuncture intervention on the severity of pain due to PDM. We found a negative association between the predicted intervention effect and brain response in the real acupuncture group. Our findings indicate that the baseline rACC–left precentral gyrus FC may influence subsequent clinical responses involving the same network and provide a potential method with which to predict the response to acupuncture treatment. We also found that the change in FC of the rACC–left precentral gyrus was positively correlated with the short-term analgesic effect of acupuncture treatment in patients with PDM, which further endorsed the importance of rACC–left precentral gyrus resting-state FC in the modulation of the pain intensity of PDM through acupuncture. These findings suggest that the change in the rACC–left precentral gyrus resting-state FC may be the underlying central mechanism of the immediate analgesic effect of acupuncture. \n\n\n### Study Limitations \n  \nThis study has some limitations. The patients’ expectations of the outcome of acupuncture may have impacted the study results, although minimal communication was required during the study period. As the fMRI scans were performed within the first 3 days of the menstruation period, the compliance of some patients was affected and there were some dropouts during the follow-up period. Moreover, due to financial constraints, imaging data were not collected during the non-menstrual period. Finally, the sample size was small. The present findings require confirmation in further large-scale studies. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe present study showed that twirling acupuncture (at both real and sham acupoints) resulted in different brain activities in pain-related brain areas, suggesting that acupuncture acts via multiple neural mechanisms. The task fMRI study found that the rACC and right SMA were activated during real acupuncture. The resting-state FC method showed that the post- versus pre-treatment change in FC between the rACC and the left precentral gyrus differed after real acupuncture versus sham acupuncture. In addition, the FC of the rACC–left precentral gyrus at baseline was negatively correlated with short-term analgesia, while the change in FC of the rACC–left precentral gyrus was positively correlated with the short-term analgesic effect of acupuncture treatment in patients with PDM. These findings support the importance of the rACC–left precentral gyrus resting-state FC in the modulation of the pain intensity of PDM through acupuncture, which may shed light on the central mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of PDM. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article can be obtained on reasonable request from the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was approved by Sichuan Traditional Chinese Medicine Regional Ethics Review Committee (approval number: 2013KL-033).

Here, we aimed to investigate the clinical and biological effects of intermittent theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTBS) in patients with treatment-resistant negative symptoms of schizophrenia (NCT00875498). In a randomized sham-controlled 2-arm study, 22 patients with schizophrenia and treatment-resistant negative symptoms received 20 sessions of either active (  n   = 12) or sham (  n   = 10) iTBS. Sessions were delivered twice a day on 10 consecutive working days. Negative symptom severity was assessed 5 times using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS): before iTBS, after iTBS, and 1, 3, and 6 months after iTBS. As a secondary objective, we explored the acute effects of iTBS on functional connectivity of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using seed-based resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsFC fMRI) images acquired before and after iTBS. Active iTBS over the left DLPFC significantly decreased negative symptoms severity compared to sham iTBS (  F   = 3.321,   p   = 0.026). Post hoc analyses revealed that the difference between groups was significant 6 months after the end of stimulation sessions. Neuroimaging revealed an increase in rsFC between the left DLPFC and a brain region encompassing the right lateral occipital cortex and right angular gyrus and a right midbrain region that may encompass dopamine neuron cell bodies. Thus, iTBS over the left DLPFC can alleviate negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The effect might be driven by significant modulation of dopamine transmission. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSchizophrenia is a severe and frequent mental disorder usually characterized by negative, positive and disorganization symptoms. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia (NSS) classically include affective flattening or blunting, alogia, asociality, anhedonia and avolition. NSS are highly disabling, and their treatment is a major challenge to achieve recovery in patients with schizophrenia . NSS are particularly resistant to pharmacological medication , and approximately 30% of patients still experience NSS even during treatment with antipsychotic drugs at adequate doses and durations . To develop new therapeutic approaches, studies have focused on exploring the neurobiological underpinnings of NSS. \n\nAt a structural level, imaging studies have reported that the volume of prefrontal regions, including orbitofrontal, medial and lateral prefrontal cortices, was inversely correlated with NSS severity . Interestingly, a white matter volume decrease was observed in prefrontal areas in patients with NSS and was associated with higher levels of NSS . At a functional level, studies using positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) found that NSS were strongly associated with decreased frontal and prefrontal metabolism at rest or during activation . Specific prefrontal areas, in particular, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), have been identified . More recent studies have suggested that patients with NSS have structural and functional impairments in prefrontal areas and that the connectivity between those areas and the rest of the brain, including striatal regions, is also impacted . \n\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a neuromodulation technique that can modulate the activity and connectivity of the brain, including when applied over the DLPFC . rTMS uses an external magnetic field applied directly on the scalp to modulate the electrical activity of neurons located under the stimulation coil. Repeated stimulations induce changes in cortical excitability that outlast the stimulation period. In patients with NSS, applying rTMS with high-frequency (HF) stimulation over the left DLPFC has shown promise . However, although some positive studies have been published that led European guidelines to conclude that there is possible efficacy of HF rTMS over the left DLPFC for NSS , large negative multicenter randomized studies are also available (e.g., ref.  ). To explain these discrepancies between studies, one can hypothesize that rTMS parameters have not been optimized. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a rTMS protocol that consists of delivering bursts of 3 TMS pulses at high frequency (50 Hz) every 200 ms for 2 s every 10 s (i.e., intermittently). This form of stimulation allows delivering a more important number of rTMS pulses in a shorter period of time than standard HF rTMS protocols and is known to produce long-lasting effects on cortical excitability . In a recent randomized controlled trial comparing 10 Hz rTMS, 20 Hz rTMS and iTBS in patients with NSS, Zhao and colleagues  showed that iTBS resulted in a significantly larger reduction in NSS than classic HF rTMS protocols. Taken together, these studies claimed that iTBS over the left DLPFC should be used to decrease NSS, but the results have to be replicated. Moreover, a better understanding of the biological effect of iTBS in patients with NSS would help us to optimize stimulation efficacy. \n\nHere, we hypothesized that repeated sessions of iTBS over the left DLPFC would result in alleviation of NSS by modifying functional connectivity of the DLPFC. The aim of this work was (1) to investigate the clinical effects of iTBS targeting the left DLPFC on NSS and (2) to explore functional connectivity modifications induced by iTBS with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) MRI. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nAs shown in Table  , the active and sham groups did not significantly differ in demographics, electrophysiological measures and baseline clinical ratings.   \nDemographic and clinical baseline characteristics of the patients included in the study. \n  \n CDSS   Calgary depression scale for schizophrenia,   eq cpz   chlorpromazine equivalent,   PANSS   positive and negative syndrome scale, resting motor threshold is expressed as a % of maximal stimulator output;   SANS   scale for the assessment of negative symptoms. Student’s t tests were used to compare demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. Sex and handedness proportion differences were assessed using chi-square tests. No differences were observed between patients in the active and sham groups. \n  \n\n### Effects of iTBS on negative symptoms \n  \nRepeated measures ANOVA on SANS scores revealed a significant interaction between time and group (  F   = 3.32,   p   = 0.026). After the end of the trial (6-month follow-up), a mean decrease of 26.72% (standard error of the mean (sem) = 5.50%) in the SANS score was observed in the active group, and a mean decrease of 6.07% (5.91%) was observed in the sham group. The post hoc comparisons showed a significant difference in SANS scores between the active group and the sham group only at the endpoint time sixth months after the iTBS sessions (  p   = 0.019). The effect size was large according to the standardized effect sizes (Cohen’s   d   = 1.09). The changes in total SANS scores throughout the study period is presented in Fig.  .

M1, M3, M6 represent follow-up assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months after the end of iTBS treatment, respectively. Error bars represent standard errors of the mean. \n  \n\nTo rule out a potential effect of the severity of depression at baseline on our results, we added CDSS scores as a covariate in our analysis. We found no significant effect of CDSS (  F   = 0.83,   p   = 0.37) or time X CDSS interaction (  F   = 1.34,   p   = 0.27). In contrast, the effect of the group X time interaction remained significant (  F   = 5.37,   p   = 0.003). \n\n\n### Effects of iTBS on other clinical dimensions \n  \nRepeated measures ANOVA on PANSS total scores revealed no significant interaction between time and group (  F   = 1.62,   p   = 0.20). No interaction was observed regarding PANSS subscale scores: PANSS positive score (  F   = 0.61,   p   = 0.61), PANSS negative score (  F   = 1.62,   p   = 0.19), and PANSS general psychopathology score (  F   = 1.05,   p   = 0.38). \n\n\n### Tolerability and blinding \n  \nThe intervention was well tolerated, and no seizures or other life-threatening events occurred. In both groups, mild headaches were reported during the stimulation sessions. There were two serious adverse events during the follow-up period: two patients from the sham group displayed an exacerbation of positive symptoms requiring hospitalization. \n\nTreatment conditions were not correctly classified by either the patients (chi  = 0.22,   p   = 0.64) or the clinical raters (chi  = 1.77,   p   = 0.18). \n\n\n### Effects of iTBS on left DLPFC seed-based rsFC \n  \nAmong the 22 patients, imaging data from 17 patients were available and analyzed (10 in the active group and 7 in the sham group). Between-group analysis showed no significant rsFC difference between the two groups at baseline. Comparisons of rsFC changes (post-iTBS minus pre-iTBS) between the two groups revealed that rsFC significantly increased between the left DLPFC seed and the right brain stem/midbrain (MNI coordinates   x  ,   y  ,   z   = 10, −12, −20;   k   = 98 voxels;   T   = 6.66;   Z   = 4.48;   p   < 0.001) and between the left DLPFC seed and a cluster encompassing the right superior lateral occipital cortex and the right angular gyrus (  x  ,   y  ,   z   = 40, −70, 24;   k   = 91 voxels;   T   = 6.66;   Z   = 4.47;   p   < 0.001) after active iTBS compared to sham iTBS (see Table   and Fig.  ).   \nBrain regions showing significant changes in dorsolateral prefrontal resting-state functional connectivity after active vs. sham stimulation (active stimulation (post-pre) > sham stimulation (post-pre) contrast). \n  \n BA   Brodmann area.

The results were thresholded at an uncorrected voxel-level threshold of   p  <.001 with an FWE-corrected   p  <0.05 (minimum   K  =91). \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we investigated the clinical and biological effects of iTBS targeting the left DLPFC on NSS. We reported a significant effect of iTBS over sham, and the improvement in NSS was statistically significant at 6 months after the treatment, with a 26% decrease in the SANS score in the active group. These results are consistent with recent meta-analyses that emphasized the efficacy of HF rTMS on NSS in patients with schizophrenia . \n\nClinical improvement was observed 3 months after the end of the stimulation sessions but became statistically significant only at the evaluation time point 6 months after the end of the iTBS regimen. This long-term delayed response was unexpected but corroborated previous rTMS studies that also reported a delayed effect of rTMS on NSS. For instance, Li and colleagues  observed a significant difference in SANS scores after rTMS treatment between active and sham groups 8 weeks after the end of stimulation sessions but not after 4 weeks. In patients with major depression, a delayed clinical effect was also observed two weeks after the end of an iTBS protocol, suggesting that iTBS itself could have a delayed effect mechanism . In addition to the potential delayed effects of rTMS, negative symptoms are also slow to change, as engaging in more relationships and social activities can take time to establish, which is why the recommended duration of trials on negative symptoms is 6 months . Another possible explanation is that our population was quite old for a population of patients with schizophrenia (more than 40 years old on average in both groups). This pathology typically starts in early adulthood, but we included resistant patients who had already had other lines of treatment and were therefore older. Older patients might have longer symptom durations and less plasticity, which could explain the delayed response. \n\nThe analysis of PANSS negative scores did not reveal any significant modification following stimulation. This is in line with Wobrock and colleagues  who published negative results in a multicenter sham-controlled study including 175 patients who received either active or sham rTMS over the left DLPFC and evaluated the negative symptoms with the PANSS. This is also in line with results from Dlabac-de Lange and colleagues  reporting significant effects of rTMS on NSS measured with the SANS but no significant changes in NSS assessed with the PANSS negative symptom scores. In Shi and colleagues’ meta-analysis , the effect size of rTMS on negative symptoms in sham-controlled trials was 0.80 when NSS were measured by the SANS and 0.41 when measured by the PANSS, suggesting that the SANS is more sensitive to clinical changes and provides better effect size in longitudinal studies. The SANS, with its 25 items divided into 5 subscales investigating specific dimensions of NSS (affective flattening or blunting, alogia, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality, and attention), seems to be more specific and sensitive than the PANSS in measuring NSS in research studies. New scales assessing NSS, such as the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS ) and the self-evaluation of negative symptoms , have been recently developed using a data-driven iterative process to improve reliability and validity . It would have been interesting to evaluate the effect of iTBS using these scales, as well as directly evaluate quality of life based on functional impairments. \n\nRegarding the imaging results from this study, the rsFC changes observed in the active group compared to the sham group included an increased connectivity between the left DLPFC and the midbrain region that may encompass dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and an increased connectivity between the left DLPFC and the right superior lateral occipital gyrus/angular gyrus (inferior parietal gyrus). Among patients with schizophrenia, the functional connectivity between the DLPFC and midbrain region, including the VTA, is known to be significantly different compared to healthy subjects . The interrelation between the DLPFC and VTA may allow goal representation and maintenance and mediate the anticipated reward (wanting) function . Anticipated reward has been linked to NSS . A restored connectivity between the DLPFC and VTA could be the neurobiological correlate of an improved ability to represent anticipated reward and improve motivational deficits in schizophrenia. A recent randomized, sham-controlled, crossover study found that DLPFC iTBS treatment modulated the reward system, based on anhedonia severity, in patients with major depression disorder . In two case studies in patients with NSS receiving iTBS over the left DLPFC, we previously reported that iTBS may induce DA release in the striatum  and modulate glutamine/glutamate (Glx) concentrations in the DLPFC . Taken together, these studies suggest that iTBS could modulate PFC-VTA connectivity and striatal DA release in patients with NSS, leading to clinical improvements. Furthermore, we reported that active iTBS increased rsFC between the left DLPFC and a cluster at the junction of the right angular gyrus and the superior division of the lateral occipital cortex. The angular gyrus has a critical contribution to changes in global brain connectivity in response to changing environmental demands. More specifically, the angular gyrus has emerged as a cross-modal hub where converging multisensory information is combined and integrated to allow comprehensive and give sense to events, manipulate mental representations, and reorient attention to relevant information . Interestingly, dysfunctions in the angular gyrus have been proposed in a neurobiological model of social deficits and ego disturbances observed in schizophrenia . In addition, the DLPFC, the angular gyrus and the superior lateral occipital cortex are part of the frontoparietal network, a network associated with higher cognitive functions, which showed decreased functional connectivity in patients with schizophrenia . Increasing connectivity between these regions may contribute to improving cognitive functions and decreasing symptoms of schizophrenia. Here, we observed that left DLPFC stimulation induced rsFC changes between the DLPFC and regions of the right hemisphere. Only a few studies have specifically investigated the impact of DLPFC-rTMS in patients with NSS. In healthy volunteers, interhemispheric effects have also been suggested with HF rTMS over the right DLPFC inducing a significant decrease in seeded functional connectivity of the targeted region with the contralateral hippocampus while participants performed in a working memory task . Further neuroimaging studies are needed to better understand the relationship between the iTBS-induced changes and the clinical improvements in NSS. For instance, future studies should investigate the correlations between observed clinical changes and changes in DLPFC connectivity strength at an individual level. \n\nThe power of the results is limited by the small sample size. However, despite the small number of participants in the study, the careful selection of participants led to a relative homogeneity of symptoms and the large effect sizes support our conclusions and recent clinical studies . This rather small sample did not allow us to investigate potential differences between responders and nonresponders to the iTBS intervention, although this is a major challenge in the TMS field. Another limitation of our study is that the patients were taking different antipsychotic medications. It would have been better to include patients with the same treatment to improve the comparability and to better explore potentiation effects. For instance, Wagner and colleagues  found that rTMS and clozapine could have a good potentiation effect on NSS. Moreover, the sex proportion was skewed towards males, thereby, contributing to the limitation of generalizability of current results. As in several other studies in patients with schizophrenia, we included a mixed sample with both right-handers and left-handers. While little is known regarding the effect of handedness on the TMS-induced effect on NSS, a recent meta-analysis in patients with major depression concluded that handedness did not influence rTMS effects on clinical symptoms . This point merits further investigation in schizophrenia since abnormalities of laterality have been repeatedly reported in patients. \n\nDespite these limitations, this study is one of the few randomized controlled studies to evaluate the clinical and biological effects of iTBS in persistent NSS. The population was carefully selected to avoid any confounding factors (depressive symptoms, positive symptoms, recent change in pharmaceutical treatment, etc.) in accordance with guidelines on clinical trials designed for NSS. At baseline, extrapyramidal side effects measured with the SAS were mild in both groups, which confirmed the primary nature of NSS in the included patients. Our results remained significant when baseline CDSS scores were added as a covariate in the variance analysis, indicating that the slight difference in depression severity at baseline did not influence iTBS effects on NSS while iTBS over the DLPFC is known to decrease depressive symptoms including anhedonia in patients with major depression . The blinding integrity was confirmed for both patient and clinician raters. Our study indicated that iTBS over the DLPFC is safe in a population of patients with persistent NSS. The effectiveness of iTBS on NSS can be considered large (  d   = 1.09), although the included population displayed characteristics that have been associated with lower response rates to rTMS (e.g., older age and longer duration of disease). These effects translate into real clinical benefits for patients from the active group with a mean decrease is SANS scores of more than 25% that is consensually accepted as a meaningful decrease . However, future studies should investigate quality of life and functioning of patients with NSS receiving iTBS with specific clinical scales and ecological evaluation. This efficiency could be related to the high number of pulses delivered (19,800) delivered at a known efficient intensity set at 80% RMT  based on an iTBS protocol that allows fast and safe delivery of TMS pulses. Indeed, among others, one advantage of iTBS compared to standard rTMS protocols is the decrease in financial and time burdens of rTMS. Positive symptoms were not worsened by the intervention, in contrast to the modest worsening of positive symptoms observed in a recent meta-analysis on rTMS trials for NSS . \n\nIn sum, iTBS targeting the left DLPFC shows promising results in the long-term treatment of persistent negative symptoms. iTBS of the left DLPFC may restore the connectivity of the DLPFC with areas involved in the representation of pleasure and the self and with areas involving mesocorticolimbic DA transmission. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nIn a randomized double-blind sham-controlled study, twenty-two patients with schizophrenia were randomized to receive either active (  n   = 12) or sham (  n   = 10) rTMS treatment. The clinical raters and the participants were blinded to the treatment conditions. A randomization list was generated with the ALEA function in an Excel file by the sponsor of the study. The randomization was performed by block (block size of four: 2 active, 2 sham). There was no stratification. After inclusion of each patient by the investigator, the TMS operator called the sponsor to obtain the random assignment of the patient (active or sham). The TMS operator was not blinded to the treatment condition, that is, only the patient and the rater were blinded. \n\n### Participants \n  \nA total of 35 patients were screened for eligibility. Nine patients declined to participate, three did not meet the inclusion criteria, and one patient was referred to another treatment (please see the CONSORT flow chart diagram shown in Fig.  ). The final analyzed sample consisted of 22 outpatients between 22 and 65 years old meeting the DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia. NSS were resistant to at least two antipsychotic medications at effective dosages for at least 6 weeks . According to the inclusion criteria, patients experienced prominent NSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS ) negative subscale ≥20, with at least 2 items ≥4) without showing a > 20% reduction in PANSS negative subscores between the preinclusion visit (at least one month before inclusion) and the inclusion visit. They also presented neither clinically significant positive symptoms (no positive item ≥4 and PANSS positive subscale <20) nor depressive symptoms as assessed by a Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS ) score <9. The exclusion criteria were as follows: clinically relevant psychiatric comorbidity (including current misuse of or dependence on illegal drugs or alcohol), concomitant treatment with anticonvulsant drugs or benzodiazepines (lorazepam >2 mg/day or equivalent), history of epileptic seizures, previous treatment with rTMS, a contraindication for rTMS, clinically relevant unstable medical conditions, involuntary hospitalization, or pregnancy. Antipsychotic medication had to be stable for at least 4 weeks before study inclusion and remained stable throughout the study. Extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed in each group with the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) , a 10-item scale with item scores ranging from 1 to 5, designed to assess the presence and severity of rigidity and bradykinesia.    Patients selection.  \nCONSORT flow chart diagram of the study. \n  \n\nThe protocol was reviewed and approved by a local ethics committee (comité de protection des personnes- CPP Sud Est 6–AFSSAPS n° 2008-A00558-47). All subjects gave their written informed consent after a detailed description of the study by the investigators from our Brain Stimulation Unit (CH Le Vinatier, psychiatric hospital, France). Details of the study were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT00875498) on April 3, 2009. \n\n\n### rTMS procedure \n  \nPatients received 20 sessions (2 sessions per working day for 2 weeks) of either active or sham stimulation delivered by a Mag Pro X100 (Magventure, Mag2Health, France). The iTBS protocol consisted of bursts containing 3 pulses at 50 Hz repeated at 200-ms intervals for 2 s (i.e., at 5 Hz). A 2-s train of iTBS was repeated every 10 s for a total of 990 pulses per session (adapted from ). The intensity of stimulation was set at 80% of the resting motor threshold (RMT) intensity. During the first session, the RMT intensity was measured and corresponded to the minimal intensity that resulted in a visual motor response of the thumb when stimulating the contralateral motor cortex. Stimulations were delivered over the left DLPFC (middle frontal gyrus, junction between Brodmann areas 9 and 46) by placing a figure-8 coil 6 cm anterior to the scalp position corresponding to the motor cortex (the hot spot where the motor threshold was defined) . The patients in the sham group received the same iTBS regimen, but stimulations were delivered using a commercial figure-8 sham coil. \n\n\n### Clinical assessment and analysis \n  \nThe severity of NSS was assessed 5 times throughout the study period with the SANS : at baseline, after the iTBS sessions and then after 1, 3, and 6 months after the end of iTBS. The effect of iTBS on overall schizophrenia symptoms was assessed using the PANSS. \n\nStudent’s t tests were used to compare demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups at baseline. Sex and handedness proportion differences were assessed using chi-square tests. \n\nAll analyses were undertaken on a strict intention-to-treat sample of the evaluable patients defined in the protocol as patients with a baseline assessment and at least one post-rTMS score. Changes (% change from baseline) in the SANS total score over the 6-month follow-up period were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), including terms for group, time, and time by group interaction. The effects on other clinical measures (PANSS) were analyzed in the same manner. The analyses were conducted in a last observation carried forward (LOCF) manner through the final endpoint. For significant interactions, Fisher’s least significant difference post hoc tests were used to determine the timing of treatment differences. Standardized effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated for significant results by dividing the estimated group difference by a measure of background variability (standard deviation of baseline score) as suggested by Cohen . An effect size of 0.2 was considered small; 0.5, medium; and 0.8, large. All tests were conducted with two-sided significance levels (α = 0.05). \n\nBlinding integrity was controlled by using a chi-square test on the patients’ and blinded raters’ ability to correctly guess the treatment allocation. \n\n\n### Functional MRI (fMRI) data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nImages were acquired at the CERMEP imaging center of Lyon (France) on a 1.5 T Magnetom Siemens scanner with a standard 8-channel head coil. A 3-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted anatomical scan covering the whole brain volume was initially acquired with the following parameters: 176 transverse slices, repetition time (TR) = 1970 ms, echo time (TE) = 3.93 ms, field of view = 256 mm², and voxel size = 1 mm . \n\nThe participants underwent 2 resting-state fMRI scans: the first was acquired on the Friday before starting the iTBS sessions, and the second was acquired 1 h after the end of the 20th iTBS session. The fMRI resting-state data were acquired using a gradient-echo T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: 5 min, 120 volumes, 29 transverse slices, TR = 2500 ms, TE = 50 ms, field of view = 220 mm², and voxel size = 3.438 × 3.438 × 4 mm. During the resting sequence, the participants remained in a state of wakeful rest; they were instructed to stay awake and to lie still with their eyes open, fixating on a white cross presented at the center of the visual field. They were instructed to not fall asleep and to think of nothing in particular. All participants wore headphones to attenuate scanner noise. \n\nThe fMRI resting-state data were preprocessed and analyzed using the CONN toolbox (v18.b,  ) in conjunction with SPM12. After the removal of the first 5 volumes, functional images were realigned (motion estimation and correction), unwarped, and slice-time corrected. Outlier detection was conducted using the artifact detection toolbox. The volumes in which the normalized z-scores from global mean signal intensity exceeded 5 or the composite motion was over 0.9 mm were identified as outliers. Then, functional images were segmented and spatially normalized into the standard MNI space (Montreal Neurological Institute, Canada) and smoothed using an 8-mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. A segmentation and normalization of anatomical scans was conducted to obtain white matter and cerebrospinal fluid masks for each participant. Denoising included the linear regression of several confounding parameters, including the six motion parameters derived from spatial-motion correction and their first-order derivatives, as well as the BOLD signal from the CSF and white matter masks (5 components each) using the anatomical CompCor approach. Motion outliers detected by the artifact detection toolbox were censored. Functional images were bandpass filtered using a temporal filter of 0.008 to 0.09 Hz and a linear detrending was performed. \n\n\n### Seed-based rsFC analysis \n  \nFor each subject, correlations between the extracted time course of an a priori seed region with other brain voxels were computed. A 10-mm spherical seed region corresponding to the left DLPFC (MNI coordinates:   x   = −43;   y   = 33;   z   = 36) was defined according to Mylius and colleagues . At the first-level, Fisher’s z-transformed Pearson’s correlation coefficients were computed between the mean time-series averaged across seed voxels that were within the estimated gray matter mask for each subject and the time course of all of the other voxels. At the second-level, between-group analyses were performed to compare the left DLPFC functional connectivity changes (post-iTBS minus pre-iTBS) between active and sham groups using two-sample T tests. The results were thresholded at an uncorrected voxel-level threshold of   p   < 0.001 with a familywise error (FWE)-corrected   p   < 0.05 at the cluster level to correct for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the   linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"9e6aa8c62c917b5c88f5bf06a4ab210f"},

Multimodal MRI allows for the investigation of cBF changes in-vivo. In this study we assessed alterations in cBF functional connectivity (FC), mean diffusivity (MD), and volume across the spectrum of AD. We further assessed effects of amyloid pathology on these changes. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nParticipants included healthy controls, and subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD dementia (ADD) from the multicenter DELCODE study. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI data was available for 477 subjects, and a subset of 243 subjects also had DTI data available. Differences between diagnostic groups were investigated using seed-based FC, volumetric, and MD analyses of functionally defined anterior (a-cBF) and posterior (p-cBF) subdivisions of a cytoarchitectonic cBF region-of-interest. In complementary analyses groups were stratified according to amyloid status based on CSF Aβ42/40 biomarker data, which was available in a subset of participants. \n\n\n## Results \n  \na-cBF and p-cBF subdivisions showed regional FC profiles that were highly consistent with previously reported patterns, but there were only minimal differences between diagnostic groups. Compared to controls, cBF volumes and MD were significantly different in MCI and ADD but not in SCD. The Aβ42/40 stratified analyses largely matched these results. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe reproduced subregion-specific FC profiles of the cBF in a clinical sample spanning the AD spectrum. At least in this multicentric cohort study, cBF-FC did not show marked changes along the AD spectrum, and multimodal MRI did not provide more sensitive measures of AD-related cBF changes compared to volumetry. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe cholinergic basal forebrain (cBF) provides the principle cholinergic innervation of the entire cerebral cortex ( ). It has become an important region of interest for research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) since neuropathological studies have documented selective cBF neuron loss in AD dementia (ADD) ( ,  ,  ). The prominent role of cBF degeneration in AD has led to the development of cholinomimetic drugs for dementia treatment. \n\nAdvances in regional volumetric analysis allowed for the development of an MRI-based in-vivo marker of cBF degeneration showing early degeneration of this region within the AD spectrum ( ,  ). Further studies suggested that in preclinical and prodromal stages of AD, cBF volume may be even more sensitive to early degenerative changes than hippocampal or entorhinal cortex atrophy ( ,  ). In vivo MRI-PET studies and a recent imaging-neuropathological association study suggest that cBF atrophy may be associated with cortical amyloid pathology in prodromal and dementia stages of AD ( ,  ,  ). \n\nBeyond volumetric changes, previous MRI studies also reported microstructural changes of the cBF in AD as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) ( ,  ), which sensitizes the MRI signal to the movement of hydrogen ( ,  ). In damaged neuronal tissue, the amount of cellular water diffusion is changed, which can be detected by DTI-derived scalar diffusion indices, such as mean diffusivity (MD), even before macrostructural (volumetric) degeneration becomes visible ( ). We piloted DTI assessment of the cBF in a multicenter cohort of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ADD, and results indicated a higher risk of conversion to dementia in MCI patients with increased MD ( ). Previous studies showed increased MD levels across the spectrum of AD in hippocampal structures ( ,  ,  ), and an investigation in Parkinson’s disease patients suggested that diffusion changes in the nucleus basalis of Meynert may be sensitive to very early stages of neurodegeneration ( ). \n\nAnother potentially powerful approach to determine cBF changes uses functional connectivity (FC) from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Rs-fMRI is based on the measurement of spontaneous fluctuations of the BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signal, which reflects activity-dependent changes in blood oxygenation in the brain ( ,  ). In AD, rs-fMRI has so far mainly been used for studying AD-related neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus and the default mode network ( ,  ,  ). In a recent methodological study based on a sample of healthy adult individuals, we were able to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring cortical FC profiles of the cBF based on rs-fMRI data and could identify two functionally distinct anterior-medial and posterior-lateral subdivisions of the cBF based on their differential cortical connectivity profiles ( ). \n\nIn the present study we evaluated comprehensive volumetric, microstructural and FC changes of the cBF in a large clinical sample spanning the cognitive spectrum from normal cognition through subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and MCI to ADD. In a subsample with available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker data, we further stratified diagnostic groups by amyloid status. We expected to detect robust changes in cBF volume only in prodromal and dementia stages of AD, whereas DTI- and rs-fMRI-assessments may already show alterations in preclinical stages of AD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data source \n  \nAll data used in this study was obtained from the DZNE- Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE) ( ). DELCODE is a German multicenter observational study on predementia AD that aims to characterize early disease stages, in particular SCD, improve disease progression prognostics and identify new markers for preclinical AD ( ). DELCODE is an ongoing study that was launched in 2015. \n\n\n### Subjects \n  \nData for a total of 510 subjects was obtained from an interim freeze of the DELCODE database based on the availability of rs-fMRI scans and the absence of anomalies such as stroke residues or tumors during a visual sighting of structural MRI scans. \n\nParticipants had been subdivided into the following groups upon inclusion into the study: \n\n(i) Participants with SCD that were defined by subjectively reported cognitive decline over a period of at least six months not related to any event or condition explaining the cognitive deficit according to research criteria and had an objective test performance within −1.5 standard deviations of the age-, sex-, and education-adjusted normal performance on all subtests of the CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease) neuropsychological test battery ( ). \n\n(ii) MCI and ADD patients who were enrolled based on clinical criteria in accordance with current guidelines by the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) ( ,  ). \n\n(iii) Healthy controls (HC), who reported no signs of SCD and had to achieve unimpaired test results according to the same definition as the SCD group. \n\nAll participants were above the age of 60 years. Exclusion criteria have been described in detail previously ( ) and included both drugs and medical conditions that have the potential of interfering with test performance. \n\nDuring preprocessing of rs-fMRI scans (see below) only subjects with head motion<2 mm translation and 2°rotation were included (N = 477) ( ). The final sample for rs-fMRI and volumetric analysis was composed of 174 HC, 171 participants with SCD, 81 MCI subjects, and 51 subjects with ADD. A subset of 281 participants also had DTI scans available, and 243 of these met quality control criteria for the DTI data (see below), resulting in a group of 88 HC, 88 participants with SCD, 40 MCI subjects, and 27 subjects with ADD. Demographics of the subjects that were analysed in this study are shown in  ,  .   \nDemographic characteristics of diagnostic groups. \n        \nDemographic characteristics of diagnostic groups in DTI subsample. \n      \n\nWritten informed consent was provided by all participants or by their representatives prior to inclusion in the study. The study was approved by local ethics committees at each of the participating centers and has been conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. \n\n\n### Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers \n  \nA subset of participants had consented to undergo a lumbar puncture performed by a medically trained study assistant prior to the procedure. CSF measurement was available for a subset of 218 participants in the rs-fMRI sample and 114 participants in the DTI subcohort. \n\nSubjects’ amyloid beta 1–42 (A  β  42) and 1–40 (A  β  40) concentrations were determined using commercially available kits (V-PLEX Aβ Peptide Panel 1 (6E10) Kit; Mesoscale Diagnostics LLC, Rockville, USA) according to the vendor’s specifications which were centrally processed at the DZNE Biorepository Bonn. Participants with available CSF data were grouped into amyloid positive and negative groups based on a previously established cut-off for the A  β  42/40 ratio (A  β  +: A  β  42/40 ratio < 0.09 ( )). The resulting sample sizes per diagnostic category are listed in  ,  . The amyloid negative HC group as well as all amyloid positive subgroups were used for further analyses. \n\n\n### Imaging data acquisition \n  \nDELCODE MRI data were acquired on nine Siemens MRI scanners including three TIM systems, four Verio systems, one Skyra system, and one Prisma system. Particular emphasis was placed on steps to assure quality and assessment standards across the multicentric acquisitions including unified scanning protocols and standard operating procedures that have been described in detail previously ( ). \n\nRs-fMRI data was obtained using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with a 64 · 64 image matrix with 47 axial slices (thickness 3.5 mm, no gap) and interleaved acquisition. The field of view (FOV) was set to 224 · 224 · 165 mm, isotropic voxel size of 3.5 mm, echo time 30 ms, repetition time 2,580 ms, flip angle 80°, and parallel imaging acceleration factor 2. \n\nDiffusion weighted imaging data was obtained using an EPI multishell-sequence with a matrix size of 120 · 120, number of slices 72, a FOV of 240 · 240 mm, isotropic voxel size 2 mm, an echo time of 88 ms, repetition time 12,100 ms, flip angle 90°, 60 gradients at 700 s/mm2 and 1000 s/mm2, and parallel imaging acceleration factor 2. \n\nAdditionally, high-resolution structural MRI images were recorded and used both as anatomical references for image preprocessing of rs-fMRI and DTI data as well as for the analysis of volumetric changes. Structural MRIs were based on a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with the following parameters: 256 · 256 image matrix with 192 sagittal slices; FOV: 250 · 250 · 192 mm; 1 mm isotropic voxel size; 4.37 ms echo time; 2500 ms repetition time; 7° flip angle; and parallel imaging acceleration factor 2. \n\nRs-fMRI and structural MRI images were recorded in the same session. The DTI scans were recorded on the same day or an optional second day of scanning (average difference in days: 6 ± 14). \n\n\n### Cholinergic basal forebrain regions of interest \n  \nThe cBF regions of interest (ROIs) that were examined in this study were based on our previous methodological work characterizing functionally homogeneous subdivisions within a stereotactic atlas of the cBF using a data-driven clustering analysis of voxel-wise cBF FC profiles in a healthy adult population ( ). The two resulting subdivisions consisted of an anterior-medial (a-cBF) and a posterior-lateral (p-cBF) subdivision of the cBF (  A  ). When compared to cytoarchitectonically defined cBF subdivisions, the a-cBF largely corresponds to the rostral nuclei of the medial septum/diagonal band and anterior medial parts of the Nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), whereas the p-cBF covers the remaining anterior-lateral, intermediate, and posterior parts of the NBM.   \n Anatomic location and functional connectivity profiles of the cBF.   A) Coronal slices from anterior to posterior showing the anterior-medial (a-cBF, green) and posterior-lateral (p-cBF, red) cBF regions of interest on representative coronal sections. B) Functional connectivity across all groups for a-cBF and p-cBF regions of interest on representative axial, mid-sagittal, and three coronal sections.

Deformation-fields resulting from this registration were used to warp the GM segments, including modulation of voxel values in order to preserve the total amount of GM volume present before warping. Individual GM volumes of the cBF ROIs were extracted from the preprocessed GM segments by summing up the modulated GM voxel values within the respective ROI masks. cBF volumes were divided by the total intracranial volume (TIV) that was calculated as the total sum of GM, WM, and CSF volumes. \n\n\n#### rs-fMRI data \n  \nFor preprocessing of fMRI data, we used the advanced version of the Data Processing Assistant for rs-fMRI (DPARSF, Version 2.2, State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China) ( ) running under Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12; Wellcome Dept. of Imaging Neuroscience, London) implemented in MATLAB 7.1 (Mathworks, Natwick). The initial ten time points of the rs-fMRI series were discarded, and the remaining images were slice time corrected. The images were realigned and thereafter checked for head motion of>2 mm and 2° in maximum head motion, which were consequently excluded (N = 35) ( ). Every participant’s T1-weighted image was coregistered to the mean functional image. Subsequently, nuisance covariates were regressed out using 24 head motion parameters ( ) as well as WM and CSF signal as nuisance regressors, including a linear detrend. In a next step, the rs-fMRI images were band pass filtered to 0.01 and 0.1 Hz, spatially normalized to MNI space using the deformation fields derived from the co-registered T1-weighted MRI scan, resliced to an isotropic voxel resolution of 3 mm, and smoothed with a 6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. For seed-based FC analysis, a-cBF and p-cBF ROIs were defined as seeds and FC was calculated based on the Pearson correlation coefficient of the seeds’ and each other voxels’ time series ( ). The resulting voxel-wise FC maps were Fisher z-transformed for further statistical analysis. \n\n\n#### DTI data \n  \nDiffusion-weighted images were preprocessed using the diffusion toolbox in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL, Version 5.0.4, Oxford Center for Functional MRI of the Brain, Oxford, UK). First, scans were corrected for eddy currents and head motion. Skull stripping was performed using the Brain Extraction Tool and diffusion tensors were fitted to the data by applying DTIfit yielding the MD maps. Next, the B0 images were co-registered to the corresponding T1-weighted MRIs and the same transformations were applied to the MD maps. The MD maps were spatially normalized to MNI-standard space by applying the deformation field from the co-registered T1-weighted MRI (without modulation). Regional MD of the a-cBF and p-cBF ROIs were then calculated by averaging the respective voxel intensities in the spatially normalized MD maps. \n\n\n#### Statistical analysis \n  \nStatistical analysis of ROI values in volume and MD analyses was performed using the statistics software package for the social sciences (SPSS, IBM Corp. Version 25.0.). The effect of diagnosis on a-cBF and p-cBF volumes and MD values was assessed using ANCOVA, with age, gender, education years, and acquisition site as covariates. Note that accounting for “acquisition site” in the model entails control for differences in scanner models but also other potential differences across sites. In order to evaluate differences in the estimated marginal means, pair-wise post-hoc t-tests of the diagnosis-specific contrasts were performed. All tests were two-tailed and statistical significance was set to p < 0.05. Cohen’s d effect sizes of the group differences were calculated based on the adjusted group means. \n\nStatistical analysis of FC differences was performed using SPM12. First, overall FC profiles of the a-cBF and p-cBF seeds were calculated using a second-level one-sample   t  -test of all subjects’ FC maps, controlled for acquisition site, age, years of education, and gender. FC maps were restricted to the brain’s GM, thresholded at p < 0.05 corrected for multiple testing by employing the Family-wise error rate (FWE), and binarized to yield masks for the analysis of FC group differences. \n\nTo determine significant changes in FC between HC and the other diagnostic groups, a series of voxel-wise two-sample t-tests were performed on the FC maps, controlled for acquisition site, age, years of education, and gender. The analyses were restricted to the seed region-specific FC masks that were calculated in the previous step, and voxel-wise results were transformed to Cohen’s d maps thresholded at p < 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons, with an additional cluster-size threshold of k > 10 voxels (270 mm ). \n\nIn complementary analyses in subjects with available CSF measures, all voxel- and ROI-wise statistical analyses of group differences were repeated in amyloid stratified groups. Specifically, the following contrasts were considered: HC  vs HC , HC  vs SCD , HC  vs MCI , HC  vs ADD . \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics \n  \nDemographics of the study sample by diagnostic group are presented in  ,  . In the full study sample, all patient groups differed significantly from the HC group with respect to age (p < 0.001), with controls being on average 2.4 years younger than SCD, 3.4 years younger than MCI and 4.1 years younger than ADD participants. The education level also differed significantly across diagnostic groups (p = 0.006), with the HC and SCD groups having on average one year more of formal education than the MCI and ADD groups. The sex distribution of SCD (p = 0.021) and MCI (p = 0.003) participants differed significantly from HC. \n\n\n### FC analysis \n  \n#### cBF functional connectivity profiles \n  \nFC profiles of the a-cBF and p-cBF subdivisions across all diagnostic groups showed specific patterns of connectivity with distributed cortical systems (  B  ). The a-cBF profile was characterised by prominent connectivity to the retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The p-cBF profile was distinguished by predominant FC with the insula, dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC), and the thalamus. Areas of overlapping connectivity of a-cBF and p-cBF seeds were seen in the posterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the temporal pole, and the medial temporal lobe. \n\n\n#### Between group differences in cBF functional connectivity \n  \nWhen compared to the HC group, FC of the a-cBF did not differ significantly in SCD, whereas the MCI group showed a small cluster of 18 voxels with reduced connectivity in the medial part of the right superior frontal gyrus, and the ADD group showed a larger cluster (74 voxels) of reduced connectivity in the left and right anterior cingulate and the medial part of the right superior frontal gyrus ( ).   \n Voxel-wise group differences in a-cBF functional connectivity.   A) Group differences between HC and MCI. MNI coordinates: X = 9, Y = 54, Z = 6. B) Group differences between HC and ADD. MNI coordinates: X = -9, Y = 39, Z = 3. Two sample t-tests controlled for age, gender, years of education, and acquisition site. Colorbar indicates Cohen’s d effect size values. Results are shown at an uncorrected voxel-wise threshold of p < 0.001 with a cluster-size threshold of k > 10 voxels. \n  \n\nFor the p-cBF, no significant differences in FC were observed between the SCD and HC group. The MCI group showed two small clusters of reduced connectivity in the right midcingulate area (13 voxels) and the right superior temporal area (23 voxels). The ADD subjects showed reduced connectivity in two small clusters in the left anterior cingulate region (23 voxels) and the right parahippocampal region (18 voxels) ( ).   \n Voxel-wise group differences in p-cBF functional connectivity.   A) Group differences between HC and MCI. MNI coordinates: X = 51, Y = -45, Z = 15. B) Group differences between HC and ADD. Upper row: MNI coordinates: X = -3, Y = 30, Z = 15.

Results are shown at an uncorrected voxel-wise threshold of p < 0.001 with a cluster-size threshold of k > 10 voxels. \n  \n\n\n\n### cBF volume \n  \nThere was a significant overall effect of diagnosis on both a-cBF (F = 12.05, p < 0.001) and p-cBF (F = 14.19, p < 0.001) volume (  A  ). Compared to HC, a-cBF volume was significantly smaller in MCI (-5.1 percent, p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = -0.52) and ADD patients (-11 percent, p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = -1.12), but was not significantly different in the SCD group (+0.1 percent, p = 0.90; Cohen’s d = 0.01). Similarly, p-cBF volume was significantly smaller in MCI (-5.9 percent, p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = -0.60) and ADD patients (-14.7 percent, p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = -1.48) as compared to the HC group, but was not significantly different in the SCD group (-0.3 percent, p = 0.89; Cohen’s d = -0.03).   \n Group differences in a-cBF and p-cBF volume and MD.   Subregional volumes (A), and MD (B) for HC, SCD, MCI and ADD groups. Volume was normalized with total intracranial volume (TIV). Displayed are group wise means and standard errors of TIV-normalized volumes and MD. \n  \n\n\n### cBF MD \n  \nThere was a significant overall effect of diagnosis on both a-cBF (F = 9.28, p < 0.001) and p-cBF (F = 4.03; p = 0.008) MD values (  B  ). In both cBF areas the mean MD rose continuously from the HC to the SCD, MCI, and ADD groups. Compared to HC, a-cBF MD was significantly higher in MCI (+14.7 percent, p = 0.001; Cohen’s d = 0.69) and ADD patients (+22.1 percent, p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 1.03), but was not significantly different in the SCD group (+5.0 percent, p = 0.13; Cohen’s d = 0.24). The p-cBF MD was significantly higher in MCI (+9.3 percent, p = 0.015; Cohen’s d = 0.48) and ADD patients (+12.9 percent, p = 0.003; Cohen’s d = 0.66) compared to HC, but was not significantly different from HC in the SCD group (+3.2 percent, p = 0.29; Cohen’s d = 0.17). \n\n\n### Analysis with Aβ-stratified diagnostic groups \n  \n#### Effects of amyloid status in FC analysis \n  \nFor the a-cBF, no significant differences in FC were observed in the HC  group when compared to the HC  reference group. SCD  subjects showed one small cluster (14 voxels) of reduced connectivity in the right hippocampus and another cluster of 20 voxels in the left anterior cingulate. The MCI  group showed one cluster of reduced connectivity (21 voxels) in the right anterior cingulate, and the ADD  subgroup showed one larger cluster of reduced connectivity (175 voxels) in the left anterior cingulate ( ).   \n Voxel-wise group differences in a-cBF functional connectivity in the amyloid stratified subgroups.

Comparing the amyloid positive subgroups to the HC -group, a-cBF volume was significantly smaller in MCI  (-5.5 percent, p = 0.03; Cohen’s d = -0.52) and ADD  (-11 percent, p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = -1.04), but not in the SCD  (-0.9 percent, p = 0.71; Cohen’s d = -0.09) or HC  (+2.3 percent, p = 0.43; Cohen’s d = 0.21) groups. Similarly, in the p-cBF, volume was significantly smaller in MCI  (-7.4 percent, p = 0.003; Cohen’s d = -0.73) and ADD  patients (-16.9 percent, p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = -1.66), but not in the SCD  (-2.5 percent, p = 0.33; Cohen’s d = -0.24) or HC  (+0.9 percent, p = 0.71; Cohen’s d = 0.09) groups when compared to the HC  group.   \n Group differences in a-cBF and p-cBF volume and MD in the amyloid-stratified subgroups.

Displayed are the group wise means and standard errors of TIV-normalized volumes and MD. \n  \n\n\n#### Effects of amyloid status in MD analysis \n  \nThere was a significant overall effect of diagnosis on a-cBF MD (F = 2.25, p = 0.019) (  B  ), although none of the pair-wise comparisons with the HC  group reached statistical significance in the reduced subgroups (HC : +1.7 percent, p = 0.84, Cohen’s d = 0.08; SCD : +9.9 percent, p = 0.20, Cohen’s d = 0.44; MCI : +12.3 percent, p = 0.11, Cohen’s d = 0.54; ADD : +11.6 percent, p = 0.20, Cohen’s d = 0.52). There was no significant overall effect of diagnosis on p-cBF MD (F = 1.51, p = 0.14) (  B  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe studied cBF FC as measured by rs-fMRI as a possible indicator of early neurodegenerative processes in preclinical stages of AD. For comparison, we analysed established volumetric as well as DTI-based microstructural indices of cBF degeneration within a relatively large multicentric cohort study. Even though we were able to closely reproduce the previously reported FC profiles for the a-cBF and p-cBF functional subdivisions in this clinical sample, there were only minimal differences in FC between diagnostic groups. The analysis of volume and MD showed the expected differences in MCI and ADD patients when compared to the HC group, but no significant differences in the SCD group. These results remained largely unchanged when patient groups were limited to individuals with biomarker-confirmed Aβ-pathology. \n\n### FC profiles by seed region \n  \nThe results from the FC analysis of a-cBF and p-cBF seeds were largely consistent with results from our previous study outlining the rs-fMRI based division of the cBF into anterior and posterior parts in healthy subjects spanning the adult age range ( ). Our results expand these findings by including subjects from the preclinical and clinical AD spectrum. In line with the previous study in healthy people ( ) and a study analysing FC of these cBF subdivisions in a group of subjects with subjective memory complaints ( ), the FC of the a-cBF was characterized by connectivity to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortex. The p-cBF FC was characterized by connectivity to the Insula, the dACC, as well as the Thalamus. Thus, our study supports the subdivision of the cBF into two functionally segregated regions that are also in line with previous histological findings of distinct cortical projection patterns among cBF subdivisions ( ). \n\n\n### FC differences between groups \n  \nDifferent to our a priori expectation, we found no significant voxel-wise differences in FC between the SCD and HC group even at a relatively lenient statistical threshold of p < 0.001, uncorrected. \n\nEven though we found between group differences in the comparison of HC and the other diagnostic groups (MCI, ADD) as well as in the amyloid stratified comparison to HC  (SCD , MCI , ADD ), none of these results would have survived the application of stricter levels of significance entailed by appropriate multiple comparison corrections. While Cohen’s d maps of the voxel-wise group differences in cBF-FC indicate peak effect sizes that are in a similar range as for the volumetric and diffusion analyses, it is important to note that these Cohen’s d values are strongly positively biased because the voxel-wise analysis exploratively searches the largest group differences among all voxels of the respective FC profile. Therefore, these voxel-wise Cohen’s d values reflect the largest possible effect size obtainable for FC analyses of the cBF seeds in this particular sample, and cannot be directly compared to the Cohen’s d effect sizes obtained for the a priori ROI-based results of volume and MD changes in the cBF. \n\nOur results are in contrast to a study examining FC of the NBM in a group of MCI patients that found a small cluster (87 voxels) of decreased connectivity in the left insula/claustrum ( ), which was cluster level corrected at p < 0.05. However, similar to our present findings the statistics indicated a relatively small effect size for this cluster. Furthermore, Li et al. used a stereotactic NBM ROI as seed region which forms a subset of our functionally-defined cBF seeds, and thus differences in the seed regions may have contributed to varying FC profiles. \n\nResults from a previous study investigating FC of the cBF in a group with subjective memory complaints had indicated associations between p-cBF FC and global cortical amyloid load ( ). By contrast, in our study we could not find robust effects of FC changes in amyloid positive SCD subjects compared with amyloid negative controls that would survive a corrected significance threshold. Apart from the smaller number of amyloid stratified cases in our study, one major difference is the derivation of amyloid status from CSF Aβ levels in our and from amyloid PET data in the previous study ( ). \n\nConsidering rs-fMRI studies in participants with SCD in general, it is important to note that there is still no precise understanding of the type of disruption caused in SCD. There have been studies suggesting both reduced as well as increased FC in SCD ( ,  ), which likely reflects the large underlying pathological heterogeneity in SCD groups. Our findings of only small FC differences in SCD and MCI are in line with a previous study that was based on a partly overlapping sample from the DELCODE cohort ( ). In this study, the degree of diagnostic accuracy of whole brain FC analysis exceeded random guessing accuracy only in ADD, but not in MCI or SCD groups, suggesting little discriminatory power and possibly indicating a high level of noise in the functional data impeding the detection of differences ( ). Another possible explanation for the high consistency of FC across diagnostic groups could be an inherent resistance to reduction of FC that would be in line with findings of up-regulated choline acetyltransferase markers as a possible response to the onset of neurodegeneration found in neuropathological studies in MCI ( ,  ). However, cBF FC changes were even relatively small in the sample of ADD patients, for which cholinergic depletion is well established by both long-standing neuropathological as well as more recent neuroimaging studies ( ). This suggests that cBF FC in rs-fMRI data may not represent a close imaging proxy of cortical cholinergic depletion. \n\n\n### Volume analyses \n  \nIn accordance with our initial hypothesis, we found robust changes in cBF volume and MD in the MCI and ADD groups compared to controls. Previous MRI studies have mainly focussed on volume loss in the hippocampus, which has been shown to reliably differentiate the MCI stage ( ,  ,  ). Studies on the cBF have yielded similar results in MCI ( ,  ). Furthermore, volumetric analysis of the cBF has been reported to be more sensitive to early degenerative changes in prodromal AD than hippocampal volume ( ,  ,  ). Interestingly, previous neuropathological ( ) and structural MRI studies ( ,  ) had specifically implicated the posterior subdivision of the NBM (Ch4p) in early and most pronounced neurodegeneration in AD. This was also supported by a study using volumetry of a cytoarchitectonically-defined posterior NBM subdivision of the cBF in an independent sample of SCD subjects ( ). Correspondingly, in our present analysis we observed consistently higher effect sizes for differences in p-cBF volumes compared to a-cBF volumes for all assessed group contrasts. However, even for p-cBF volumes the effect sizes were not large enough to yield significant volume reductions in the SCD or SCD  groups. This may at least partly be due to the fact that we focussed our analyses on two broader defined functional cBF subdivisions that are robustly differentiated by their different FC profiles in rs-fMRI data. One may hypothesize that volumetric analysis of the subtle changes at the SCD stage may be particularly susceptible to the exact part of the cBF that is being analysed and that larger ROIs may thus be less sensitive for the detection of these effects. \n\nIn the analysis of amyloid stratified subgroups, our results are in accordance with previous studies reporting significant volume loss in MCI  and ADD  ( ,  ,  ). Previous combined volumetric and amyloid-PET studies in MCI ( ,  ,  ) had suggested that cBF volumetry was strongly associated to amyloid burden and this was recently supported by evidence from an imaging-neuropathological association study ( ). Therefore, we had expected a stronger connection of cBF volume to amyloid status even in preclinical cases. \n\n\n### MD analyses \n  \nMD was significantly increased in MCI and ADD patients when compared to HC. A previous study showed that MD in the cBF was predictive of progression from MCI to AD ( ). However, similar to our current cross-sectional findings of comparable effect sizes for MD and volume differences, MD changes were not superior to volumetric measurements as predictors of conversion in that longitudinal follow-up study ( ). \n\nSimilarly, another previous study suggested that MD was not a better marker than volume for detecting hippocampal degeneration in MCI ( ). However, in contrast to these results, other studies suggested that analysis of hippocampal MD may be more sensitive than volumetric analysis in detecting subtle changes in pre-AD stages ( ,  ). \n\nOur study does not support the idea that in the absence of macrostructural cBF changes in very early stages of the AD spectrum microstructural cBF changes may instead be detected by analysis of MD. Two recent studies analysed WM MD in a partly overlapping sample from the DELCODE study. They also found only subtle ( ) or no differences ( ) between HC and SCD subjects and concluded that WM MD may not be a useful biomarker for preclinical AD. The results from the present study extend these observations to MD of the cBF. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThis study has several limitations. First, even with standardized acquisition protocols and image quality control, between-group differences, especially in the analysis of DTI data, may still be affected by inter-scanner variance ( ). However, a multicentric design is necessary for evaluating the robustness of group effects as a key requirement of potential imaging markers that are to be used in wider clinical settings. Furthermore, we did not assess a possible influence of partial volume effects on our results. The cBF is in relatively close vicinity to the CSF space, which could have contributed to a contamination of the cBF signal, particularly considering the relatively lower spatial resolution of rs-fMRI and DTI data ( ,  ). However, it has to be noted that the cBF ROIs employed in our study were specifically defined on the basis of providing consistent FC signal in an independent rs-fMRI data set with comparable spatial resolution ( ). The observed FC profiles of the cBF subdivisions in our study were also highly comparable to the previously identified profiles ( ) and were reproducible across diagnostic groups, thus arguing against a major CSF signal confound in the employed cBF seeds. Moreover, at least for DTI-MD values a signal confound with CSF would generally lead to increased values, and thus these partial volume effects typically increase disease-related signal changes in neurodegenerative diseases ( ). Therefore, in clinical contexts where the principal aim of an imaging biomarker is early detection of neurodegenerative disease, rather than the precise nature of the underlying tissue changes per se, eliminating these effects by partial volume correction methods may underestimate the diagnostic value of the imaging biomarker ( ). \n\nThe cross-sectional design of this study poses another limitation. For future research efforts, especially in the SCD group, longitudinal study designs will be invaluable as our current study is not able to differentiate between SCD participants who actually convert to ADD and those who remain stable over time. Longitudinal acquisition is currently ongoing in the DELCODE study which will allow studying the prognostic potential of the different imaging markers. \n\n### Conclusion \n  \nOverall these data indicate that neither cBF FC nor MD were superior to standard volumetric assessment in identifying early disease stages of AD. Future research in longitudinally characterized SCD samples may help to further elucidate the role of cBF changes in the development of AD and to assess the utility of multimodal MRI-derived measurements as predictive imaging biomarkers. \n\n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Meret Herdick:   Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft.

Among the presented researches, the method of constructing FCN based on Matrix Variate Normal Distribution (MVND) theory provides a novel perspective, which can capture both low- and high-order correlations simultaneously with a clear mathematical interpretability. However, when fitting MVND model, the dimension of the parameters (i.e., population mean and population covariance) to be estimated is too high, but the number of samples is relatively quite small, which is insufficient to achieve accurate fitting. To address the issue, we divide the brain network into several sub-networks, and then the MVND based FCN construction algorithm is implemented in each sub-network, thus the spatial dimension of MVND is reduced and more accurate estimates of low- and high-order FCNs is obtained. Furthermore, for making up the functional connectivity which is lost because of the sub-network division, the rs-fMRI mean series of all sub-networks are calculated, and the low- and high-order FCN across sub-networks are estimated with the MVND based FCN construction method. In order to prove the superiority and effectiveness of this method, we design and conduct classification experiments on ASD patients and normal controls. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of “hierarchical sub-network method” is greatly improved, and the sub-network found most related to ASD in our experiment is consistent with other related medical researches. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFunctional connectivity networks (FCN), usually calculated from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals as neurophysiological indicators, are playing an increasingly important role in exploring the working mechanism of the brain and investigating the brain’s functional variations of some mental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) ( ;  ), major depressive disorder ( ), Alzheimer’s disease ( ;  ), and its early stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment ( ;  ), et al. \n\nFCN is a weighted network based on the graph theory, which takes the regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain as the nodes, the correlation of the rs-fMRI time series between different ROIs as the functional connectivity (FC) and the FC strength as the weight of the edge ( ). Among all the methods for FC estimation, the most classic and popular example is Pearson’s Correlation (PC) ( ;  ;  ). So far, it has been commonly known that the brain network structures and edge weights of the patients are different from those of the normal population due to the occurrence of pathological changes ( ). \n\nAt present, researchers have proposed many FCN models for disease diagnosis, which can be roughly divided into two categories. The first class is the so-called “low-order FCN” ( ) that can only reflect FC characteristics between any two ROIs. For example, the conventional FCN assumes that all the rs-fMRI time series are static during the whole scanning period. Under such assumption, FC is quantified with the correlation (e.g., Pearson’s correlation) between a pair of rs-fMRI time series derived from two ROIs ( ). The dynamic FCN overcomes the drawback that the conventional FCN cannot reflect the dynamic information of brain activity. Based on the sliding window strategy, the rs-fMRI time series are divided into a set of short time series fragments, and the conventional FCN is constructed on each fragment. This can capture dynamic FC changes over time to a certain extent ( ). Notice that the low-order FCNs only calculate the pairwise correlation between two brain ROIs while fail to reflect deeper linkage mechanism involving multiple ROIs inside the brain. And the functional connectivity involving multiple ROIs may contain complementary information to low-order FC. The second class of FCN model is the so-called “high-order FCN” ( ) that can capture deeper brain information by designing FC model of multiple ROIs. For example, on the basis of dynamic FCN,   and   took each FC time series as the network node and the correlation coefficient of FC time series of each ROI pair as the edge weight to construct a high-order FCN, which fills the interaction between paired ROI and other ROI pairs.   proposed a novel method to capture second-level relationship between two brain regions using inter-regional resemblance of the FC topographical profiles, which complements the discovery of more biologically meaningful inter-group differences. Furthermore,   combined inter-regional resemblance of the FC topographical profiles with dynamic network and central moment to explore dynamic and high-order relationships between two brain regions, which mines the dynamic FC relationship of multiple ROIs from multiple perspectives. Of note, the above methods all share the “correlation’s correlation” strategy. In addition, in the literatures, many authors (e.g.,  ,  ) have presented the importance of high-order FC and explained potential biological meanings of high-order FC networks in dedicated studies. Since this paper mainly focuses on the applications of high-order FCNs for diagnosis, detailed discussion about general biological meanings of high-order FC networks can be found in these published works. \n\n proposed a novel FC estimation method based on Matrix Variate Normal Distribution (MVND) theory. Compared with other higher-order models, MVND-based FCN can simultaneously obtain both low- and high-order FCNs with a clear mathematical explanation, and has demonstrated superior performance in identifying MCI patients from NCs. Specifically, the FCN sequence is constructed with the sliding window strategy, and then the so-constructed FCNs are taken as the samples to estimate the final low-order and high-order FCNs. In other words, each FCN is regarded as a random variable matrix (RVM) which obeys MVND, and all the FCNs in the sequence are taken together as the sample population to fit an MVND model. Like the other models mentioned above, Zhou’s work is an FCN construction method based on fully brain network (FBN). So, we use the term “fully network FCN method” to refer to the method presented by  . \n\nHowever, the “fully network FCN method” has the problem of “high dimension but small sample,” which makes it actually impossible to fit an MVND model accurately. Theoretically, when fitting any distribution, the more samples there are, the more accurate the distribution will be. Besides, the higher spatial dimension where the distribution is located, the more samples will be needed in a fitting task. However, there exist the following facts in the “fully network FCN method”: (1) each FCN is represented as a 116 × 116 matrix. (2) Each rs-fMRI time series contains only 137 volumes at most leading that no more than 137 FCNs can be generated even through the sliding window strategy. In fact, it is almost impossible to fit such a high-dimensional distribution with such a small number of samples. \n\nIn general, for fitting a more accurate MVND, either reducing the dimension of the RVM or increasing the number of RVM will be helpful. In other words, the fitting accuracy of MVND can be improved by reducing the ratio between the dimension of RVM and the number of RVM. However, as mentioned above, it is impossible to generate more than 137 FCNs through sliding windows even in extreme cases, then increasing the number of RVM is not feasible. Therefore, we put forward the “hierarchical sub-network method” to improve the “fully network FCN method” from the perspective of reducing the dimension of RVM in this paper. Specifically, the brain network is divided into several sub-networks, and each sub-network contains only part of rs-fMRI time series. Firstly, the MVND based FCN construction algorithm is implemented in each sub-network, so as to reduce the spatial dimension of MVND and obtain more accurate estimates of intra-sub-network low- and high-order FCNs. Furthermore, the rs-fMRI mean series of all sub-networks are obtained, and the low- and high-order FCN across sub-networks are estimated according to the same strategy to compensate for the loss of FC information caused by sub-network division. \n\nWe propose the “hierarchical sub-network method” based on the following two motivations. On one hand, the ratio of the dimension of RVM to the number of RVM can be effectively decreased, so as to improve the fitting effect of MVND through the sub-network strategy. In fact, in this paper, the brain is divided into six relatively independent sub-networks according to the BrainNet Viewer software ( ) like: the default mode network (DMN), the execution and attention network (EAN), etc. In other word, each sub-network is a relatively independent functional area and just contains a little part of ROIs. We take the largest sub-network as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of this method in improving MVND fitting. The largest sub-network only contains 26 ROIs, so in the MVND-based FCN construction method, RVM is expressed as a 26 × 26 matrix. Each ROI measured 170 signal elements, the ratio of the dimension of RVM to the number of RVM is 3.97 in our method, while in the “fully network FCN method,” as analyzed earlier, the RVM is represented as a 116 × 116 matrix and the dimension quantity ratio of RVM is 79.15. Therefore, our method can reduce the difficulty of MVND fitting from the perspective of spatial dimension. \n\nOn the other hand, although the sub-network strategy can achieve more accurate fitting of MVND and more accurate extraction of FC information in sub-networks, we have to point out the fact that merely building FCN in sub-networks inevitably loses FC information of ROIs across different sub-networks, which can be understood more clearly by comparing FC information captured in fully network ( ) and sub-network ( ) of brain.   represents the eight FCs among the six ROIs before network division.   reflects that the attention to FC information of ROI within the sub-network ignores the two FCs belonging to ROI of different networks. In this paper, we defuse this problem skillfully through the correlation of any pair of sub-networks. Specifically, we first average all the rs-fMRI time series in each sub-network to get 6 (the number of sub-networks) mean time series, and then take all sub-networks as nodes to construct the low- and high-order FCN with MVND based FCN construction method. Corresponding to intra-sub-network features, these features are called inter-sub-network features. Finally, both intra-sub-network features and inter-sub-network features are used as the basis for autism classification experiments. \n  \nThe comparison of the FC information captured in fully network   (A)   and sub-network   (B)   of brain. The dots represent ROIs and the red lines represent FCs. Yellow dots and green dots depict two different sub-networks. \n  \nIn summary, the advantages of the “hierarchical sub-network method” are as follows: first, combining the MVND-based FCN construction method with functional sub-networks can reduce the spatial dimension of MVND and achieve more accurate fitting of MVND; Second, capturing intra-sub-network features and inter-sub-network features from macro and micro perspectives to achieve the full expression of FC information in brain networks. In order to verify that the “hierarchical sub-network method” is superior to the “fully network FCN method,” we apply both methods to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database for individual based classification between ASD patients and NCs. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Data Acquisition and Preprocessing \n  \nIn this study, 92 rs-fMRI images of subjects with ages ranging from 7 to 15 years old from the publicly available Autism Brain Image Data Exchange Database (ABIDE) ( ) are used, including 45 ASD patients and 47 NCs In order to avoid the influences of the heterogeneity of multi-site data on the results due to the difference in medical device, collection protocol, etc., we chose 45 ASD patients (36 males and 9 females) and 47 NC subjects (36 males and 11 females) with ages ranging from 7 to 15 years old. The mean frame-wise displacement was computed to describe head motion for each individual. The individuals were excluded if their mean FD is larger than 1 mm ( ;  ). All these considered subjects had no excessive head motion with a displacement of < 1.5 mm or an angular rotation of < 1.5 in any of three directions. The detailed demographic information of these subjects is summarized in  . As shown in  , there are no significant differences (  p   > 0.05) in gender, age, and FIQ between two groups. \n  \nDemographic information of the subjects. \n    \nThe observed rs-fMRI images are scanned at New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center using a 3 -T Siemens Allegra scanner with the following parameters: flip angle = 90, 33 slices, TR/TE = 2,000/15 ms, 180 volumes, and voxel thickness = 4 mm. More details on the data collection, exclusion criteria, and scan parameters can be obtained from the ABIDE website. \n\nThe acquired rs-fMRI data is preprocessed by the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software.  Then, the brain is parcellated into 116 ROIs using the Automated Anatomical Marker (AAL) atlas ( ), and the average rs-fMRI time series for each ROI are calculated and expressed as a data matrix   X   ∈   R  , where 170 denotes the total number of temporal image volumes and 116 denotes the total number of brain ROIs. \n\n\n### The Pipeline of the “Hierarchical Sub-Network Method” \n  \nThe pipeline of our proposed “hierarchical sub-network method” is shown in  , which mainly includes the following four steps: (1) Sub-network division. The division labels of the sub-network are obtained according to the BrainNet Viewer software ( ), and the rs-fMRI time series of each subject are divided into 6 groups according to the division labels. (2) Intra-sub-network feature extraction. In each sub-network, the FCN sequence is constructed with sliding window, and the MVND is fitted with the FCN sequence being the RVM sample to obtain the intra-sub-network features. (3) Inter-sub-network feature extraction. The mean time series of each subnetwork is calculated, and then the low-order and high-order FCNs of the fully network are estimated synchronously with the MVND-based FCN construction method. (4) Feature normalization, feature selection and feature fusion. The features obtained in steps (2)—(3) are normalized. Then we use   T  -test and LASSO algorithms to select the most relevant features for the classification task. (5) ASD classification. We use SVM with linear kernel for ASD classification. \n  \nThe pipeline of the “hierarchical sub-network method.” \n  \nIn the following subsections, we describe the above steps in detail. The meanings of the mathematical symbols are that bold uppercase letters represent matrices (i.e.,   M  ), regular uppercase letters represent total values (i.e.,  M  ), bold lowercase letters represent vectors (i.e.,   m  ), and regular lowercase letters represent scalars (i.e.,   m  ). \n\n\n### Dividing the Brain Into Sub-Networks \n  \nFor each subject, we define   x   = (  x  ,   x  , ⋯,   x  )(  i   = 1,2, ⋯,  N  ) as the average rs-fMRI time series across all voxels belonging to the   i  -th ROI, where   M   denotes the total number of temporal image volumes, and   N   denotes the total number of ROIs. According to the experimental data mentioned above, here   M   = 170 and   N   = 116. Divide all ROIs into   U   different sub-networks {Ω ,Ω ,⋯,Ω ,⋯,Ω }, where   U   consists of index   i   if   x   is included in the   u  -th sub-network. In the current study, the 116 ROIs in the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template were divided into six common functional networks according to the BrainNet Viewer software ( ): the default mode network (DMN), the execution and attention network (EAN), the sensorimotor network (SMN), the visual network (Visual), the subcortical nuclei (SBN) regions and the cerebellum (Cerebel), so here   U   = 6. Of note, we choose this division method for the following two reasons. On one hand, the generated six sub-networks based on the BrainNet Viewer software have clear biological explanation, which makes this study have a broader medical reference value. On the other hand, dividing six sub-networks is enough to satisfy the dimensionality reduction needs of this study. Since the number of ROIs varies in each sub-network, we can use   N   to denote the total number of ROIs in the   u  -th sub-network.   gives an intuitive view of the division of the sub-network. In section “Discussion,” we also discuss the sub-network division method based on similarity. \n  \nVisualization of the location of each sub-network in brain. \n  \n\n### Constructing the Functional Connectivity Network Time Series With Sliding-Window Strategy \n  \nIn  ,   step 1   illustrate the construction of the FCN time series with sliding-window strategy vividly. Let the correlation between the   i  -th and the   j  -th ROIs be: \n  \nThe MVND based FCN construction method. Where,   step 1   shows the sliding-window strategy,   step 2   shows the MVND based feature extraction. \n  \nThen, an FCN can be established using the classical method by taking   x   as nodes and   c   as weights of edges. Here,   c   is the weight of the edge connecting the   i  -th ROI and the   j  -th ROI. In the   u  -th sub-network,   i  ,  j   ∈ Ω , the total number of nodes of FCN is   N  , thus FCN can be expressed as a symmetric matrix, defined as follows: \n\nwhere   W   ∈   R   represents the FCN in the   u  -th sub-network. Next, the sliding window strategy is introduced. The entire rs-fMRI time series of all ROIs is divided into   K   segments by window sliding, and corresponding FCNs are established on each rs-fMRI time series segment, thus forming a sequence containing   K   FCNs where   K   is determined by the window width   l   and step size   l   of the sliding window. \n\nSpecifically, taking the   u  -th sub-network as an example, the total number of ROIs is   N  , the total number of timing image voxels is   M  , and a sequence containing   K   FCNs, denoted by  , will be obtained through the sliding window strategy, where  ,   l   and   l   are variable parameters. \n\n\n### Extracting the Intra-Sub-Network Features \n  \n In  , step 2 displays the pipeline of the extraction of intra-sub-network features. In each sub-network, we regard the obtained FCN sequence as a sample population obeying a multivariate Gaussian distribution, then each FCN is regarded as a random variable matrix sample, then \n\nwhere,   M   ∈   R   is the population mean or mathematical expectation, and   is the population covariance of   W  . As mentioned in the introduction,   M   and   Σ     correspond to the low-order FC Features and high-order FC Features of brain networks, respectively. Since the dimension of   Σ     is too high, in order to avoid overfitting in the classification experiment, and consistent with the method in   we replace the population variance with the form of Kronecker product decomposition ( ), i.e.,  , where   are positive semi-definite, representing the column and row covariance matrices of   W  , respectively. Since   W   is a symmetric matrix,  , we can use   to replace   Σ     with the advantage of not losing information, so as to achieve the dimension reduction of   Σ    . Specifically, according to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) theory of MVND, in each sub-network, the MLE of   M   is \n\nThe MLE of   C   can be achieved by the following iteration formula: \n\nwhere, 1 ≤   k   ≤   K  , 1 ≤   u   ≤   U  . \n\n\n### Extracting the Inter-Sub-Network Features \n  \nAs mentioned in the introduction, after the sub-network division, we must consider both intra-sub-network and inter-sub-network features. The overview of the extraction of inter-sub-network features is vividly illustrated in   and the extraction of inter-sub-network features is divided into two steps: (1) Calculating the mean correlation time series for each sub-network (see  ). (2) Estimating low- and high-order FCNs simultaneously with the MVND based FCN construction method from rs-fMRI mean time series (see  ). The estimated low- and high-order FCNs are the inter-low-order features and the inter-high-order features, respectively. \n  \nThe overview of the extraction of inter-sub-network features.   (A)   Shows the calculation of rs-fMRI mean series.   (B)   Shows the pipeline of the extraction of the inter-sub-network features. \n  \nThe inter-sub-network feature extraction method is equivalent to the construction of FCN in the whole brain scale and the FCN construction method is the same as that in the sub-network scale. Both are constructed by MVND based FCN construction method, which can be referred to section “Constructing the FCN Time Series With Sliding-Window Strategy” and section “Extracting the Intra-Sub-Network Features.” Here we describe in detail the generation of mean time series of each sub-network by taking the   u  -th subnetwork as an example. \n\nThe mean correlation time series   y   of the   u  -th sub-network can be calculated by averaging those rs-fMRI time series assigned to this sub-network. Specifically, each element in   y   is defined as: \n\nWhere,   m   represents the subscript of the element in   y  , and   represents the total number of rs-fMRI time series contained in the   u  -th sub-network. \n\n\n### Feature Normalization, Selection, Fusion, and Classification \n  \nAll the features we have obtained include the intra-sub-network features and the inter-sub-network features, each of which consists of both high-order features and low-order features. Let’s call them   f  ,  f  ,  f  ,  and   f  . These four feature vectors are acquired in different ways, so there are inevitably scale differences among different features. In order to treat each feature equally, we normalize them in the same way. Here,   f  ,  f  ,  f  ,  and   f   are normalized by the “min-max normalization” method, respectively. Take   f   as an example: \n\nWhere,   f   represents the vector of intra-sub-network high-order features.   f   represents the   i  -th element in   f  ,   min  (  f  ) represents the minimum value in   f  , and   max  (  f  ) represents the maximum value in   f  . The four types of features obtained by the “sub-network FCN method” just reflect the functional connectivity relationship between or among ROIs from four perspectives and they are complementary and homogeneous. Therefore, our fusion method is to simply combine them as a whole. In other words, the normalized feature data of four feature vectors are concatenated and expressed as a long vector f, that is  . \n\nHowever, the intra-sub-network low-order features and the inter-sub-network low-order features expressed by   f   and   f   exists as the form of FCN. FCN is a symmetric matrix, and the repeated feature leads to redundancy. So, we vectorize their lower off-diagonal-triangular parts to redefine the feature vectors. In this way, the original feature represented by   f   is replaced by a new one denoted by   f  . Obviously,   f   may still contain features unrelated to ASD disease. In order to reduce the interference of irrelevant features and improve the generalization performance, we use the two-stage feature selection strategy to select a small set of most discriminative features for ASD diagnosis. \n\nThe first step is to perform a two-sample   t  -test between NCs and ASD subjects for each feature in the   f  . Those features whose   p  -value is smaller than a certain threshold are preserved. At this point, we label the newly obtained feature set as   f  . In the second step, we apply the   L  -norm regularized least squares regression, known as   LASSO   ( ), to further select the discriminative features from   f  . Specifically, we used   to denote the features of the  l  -th subject and   I   to represent the label of the   l  -th subject. If the   l  -th subject is a patient with ASD,   I   = 1; otherwise,   I   = −1. Let   w   represents the weight vector for the feature selection task. The   LASSO   model is expressed by mathematical formula as: \n\nWhere,   L   represents the total number of subjects, and  L   = 92 in this experiment. λ is a parameter, controlling the model’s sparsity based on the   L  -norm regularization. The larger the value of λ, the sparser the model is. Different from the   t  -test, which selects feature separately,  LASSO   investigates all features synchronously. The   t  -test method and the LASSO method select features from different perspectives. As a binary classification problem, the   t  -test method can effectively select the features with high significance in ASD subjects and NC subjects. However,   t  -test method treats each feature independently without taking into account their inherent correlation, thus possibly resulting in many redundant features. Therefore, we further use LASSO method for the second selection which is able to consider the relationship between features. Therefore, we combine the two methods and design a two-stage feature selection strategy. We use   F   to represent the final feature for classification. In the classification phase, we use SVM ( ) with a simple linear kernel for ASD identification. SVM seeks a maximum margin hyper-plane to separate the two kinds of samples. By adjusting the hyperparameter γ, the empirical risk of the training data and the complexity of the model can be balanced, so as to obtain good generalization performance on unlabeled test data. \n\n\n### Evaluation Methodology \n  \nWe use nested fivefold cross-validation strategy which consists of two nested loops to evaluate classification performance in this experiment. In outer loop, 92 subjects are divided into 5 subsets of the roughly same size, where one subset is selected as the test-set, and the other 4 subsets are used as the training-set. In inner loop, the data of the training-set are combined and redivided into five subsets of similar size, four of which are used for tuning the hyperparameters and one for model evaluation. The performance of our method is mainly affected by three hyperparameters, they are p and λ in feature selection and γ in SVM model. The optimal hyperparameters can be determined when the average classification accuracy reaches its optimum. we determine the optimal values for the parameters in the following range: p ∈ [0.01:0.01:0.1],λ ∈ [0.1:0.1:0.9], and γ ∈ [2 ,⋯,2 ]. When the optimal hyperparameters are selected in inner loop, they are returned to the outer loop where the model will be trained based on the training dataset and evaluated on the testing dataset. Besides classification accuracy (ACC), we use sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR), specificity or true negative rate (TNR), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV)  to comprehensively evaluate the classification performance of the two methods. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Autism Spectrum Disorder Classification Performance \n  \nIn this work, we compare the performance of the “hierarchical sub-network method” and the “fully network FCN method” in the ASD classification experiment. Specifically, we use the fusion of all the features extracted by each method to perform classification experiments. The experimental results are shown in   and can be found with   Sub-Fusion   and   Fully Fusion   as pointers. Furthermore, in order to analyze the influence of different types of features in two compared methods on the experimental results, we carry out separate experiments on intra-sub-network high-order features, intra-sub-network low-order features, inter-sub-network high-order features, inter-sub-network low-order features, fully network high-order features and fully network low-order features. In  , they are abbreviated as   Sub-Intra-High  ,   Sub-Intra-Low  ,   Sub-Inter-High  ,   Sub-Inter-Low  ,   Fully High  , and   Fully Low  . In addition, we conduct experiments on the fusion of intra-sub-network features and inter-sub-network features in the “hierarchical sub-network method” and the results can be found with the pointer   Sub-Intra-Fusion   and   Sub-Inter-Fusion   in  . Finally, we experimented with two traditional methods under the same data, and reported the experimental results in  . Traditional static FCN method and low-order dynamic FCN method are abbreviated as   con-static   and   con-dynamic  , respectively, in  . \n  \nASD classification performance using different features. \n    \n shows the mean classification performance for each compared feature type. From the experimental results shown in  , we can make the following judgments: (1) The classification accuracy of the intra-sub-network low- and high-order features of the “hierarchical sub-network method” (i.e.,   Sub-Intra-Low  ,   Sub-Intra-High  ) is better than the corresponding features extracted by the “fully-network FCN method” (i.e.,   Fully-Low  ,   Fully-High  ). (2) Both in the “hierarchical sub-network method” and the “fully-network FCN method”, the classification performance of fusion features is significantly better than those of each type of features alone. (3) The performance of the fusion features (i.e.,   Sub-Fusion  ) of the “hierarchical sub-network method” is significantly higher than those (i.e.,   Fully-Fusion  ) of the “fully-network FCN method”. (4) The classification performance of the fusion of the Intra-sub-network features extracted by “hierarchical sub-network method” (i.e.,   Sub-Intra-Fusion  ) is significantly better than the fusion of features extracted by “fully-network FCN method”(i.e.,   Fully-Fusion  ). (5) Both the “fully-network FCN method” and the “hierarchical sub-network FCN method” perform better than the two traditional FCN methods, and the “hierarchical sub-network FCN method” has the most obvious advantages. \n\n\n### Influence of Parameters on Accuracy \n  \nIn the “hierarchical sub-network method”, we use the sliding window strategy to generate FCN sequences. There are two key parameters of the sliding window strategy that have a crucial impact on feature extraction and further affect the final recognition accuracy. They are the window width   (W)   and the step size   (S)   of the sliding window. In order to evaluate the influence of these two parameters on the experimental results, we conducted an ASD classification experiment under different parameter combinations. The window width is set as [30:10:120] and the step size is set as [1:1:12].   shows the average accuracy of ASD classification under different parameter combinations. Referring to  , we can draw the following conclusions: (1) Sliding window parameters have great influence on classification performance. In the “hierarchical sub-network method,” the maximum recognition accuracy is obtained when the window width is 60 and the step size is 4; The best performance of the “fully network FCN method” is achieved when the window width is 50 and the step size is 7. (2) In the performance comparison between the “hierarchical sub-network method” and the “fully network FCN method” under the same sliding window parameters, the “hierarchical sub-network method” is superior to the “fully network FCN method” in the majority of cases. (3) In each method, the best classification performance is achieved on average when the window width is between 50 and 90. \n  \nHistogram of classification accuracy of the “hierarchical sub-network method”   (A)   and the “fully-network FCN method”   (B)   under various sliding window parameters. \n  \nIn addition, in the stage of feature fusion and classifier training, three hyperparameters have great impact on the results, that is,   p  -values in   t  -test, λ in lasso and γ in SVM. In this experiment, we explored the effects of different combinations of λ and γ on the results. Before that, the window width and step size are fixed as 60 and 4, respectively, which are also the parameter when the “hierarchical sub-network method” reaches the maximum.   shows the classification accuracy under different combinations of λ and γ in the two methods when the hyperparameter   p   = 1 of the   t  -test. From  , we can see that hyperparameter λ and γ have significant influence on the experimental results, and the effects are different in the two experiments. \n  \nHistogram of classification accuracy of the “hierarchical sub-network method”   (A)   and the “full-network FCN method”   (B)   under various hyper-parameter combinations. \n  \n\n### The Most Discriminative Sub-Networks and Features for Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis \n  \nAccording to the feature selection method mentioned in    Feature normalization, selection, and classification  ,   t  -test and  LASSO   are used to extract the most discriminative features from the original features in two steps for the ASD classification experiment. From all fivefold validation experiments, we take out and analyze the features used for training classifier each time. We trace each feature to each sub-network and count how often each sub-network is tracked. According to the frequency, the contribution of each sub-network to ASD recognition is calculated. The higher the frequency, the greater the contribution of the sub-network.   shows the contribution and distribution of different sub-networks. In order to have a more vivid and deep impression, the distribution of sub-network contribution is displayed on a surface rendering of the brain using the BrainNet viewer software (see  ). The larger the volume of the ball, the greater the contribution rate of the sub-network to ASD recognition. Each sphere represents an ROI, we only use the set of spheres with the same color to represent the sub-network to observe the relationship between each sub-network and ASD. \n  \nThe feature contribution rate of different sub-networks to classifier training. \n    \nThe sub-network associated with ASD and the strength of its contribution to ASD. \n  \nCombined with  ,  , we can see that only four sub-networks provide discriminative features for classification experiments, and DMN is the sub-network that contributes the most. This suggests that sub-network DMN is closely related to the diagnosis of ASD. Sub-network SMN and Visual provide zero contribution in this study, and precise judgments need further research. In addition, we believe that tracing the FC features that contribute most is also a convincing perspective to compare the differences between the two methods. The intra-sub-network low-order FCN and the fully network low-order FCN are used in the classification experiment. Then   t  -test and  LASSO   regression are used to select the features twice to get the final features for training. This part of the feature is considered the most discriminating. Each of these features represents an FC between a pair of ROIs. The features extracted in 10 repeated experiments are counted, and the top 10 features with the highest frequency are selected and shown in  . The name of the ROIs and brain anatomic areas shown in   are referred to the file (“Node\\_AAL116.node”) provided by BrainNet Viewer software. \n  \nThe comparison of the most discriminative features in the “hierarchical sub-network method”   (A)   and the “fully-network FCN method”   (B)  . The left-side of each diagram represents the left hemisphere of the brain, and the right-side represents the right hemisphere of the brain. In the inner circle, each line connects two ROIs, and the thickness of the line represents the strength of its identification ability. \n  \nAlthough certain genes have been found to be involved in ASD, the affected brain regions and the mechanisms behind specific defects are still poorly understood. According to  , except that the functional connections of REC in the left FRO region and PreCG in the right FRO region are selected by both methods, other features are different. The functional connection features selected by the “hierarchical sub-network method” are mostly concentrated in the FRO region. In fact, current studies have confirmed the relationship between FRO lesions and ASD disease ( ;  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe proposed “hierarchical sub-network method” based on MVND theory. This method not only inherits the advantages of MVND based FCN construction, being able to simultaneously obtain high-order features reflecting FC information among multiple ROIs and low-order features reflecting FC information between any two ROIs, but also improves the fitting effect of MVND with the help of sub-network division, so as to capture the functional connections of the brain more accurately and provide more discriminative features. We believe that compared with the “fully network FCN method,” the “hierarchical sub-network method” can fully mine the disease-disturbed FCN variation information and has a better performance in ASD classification experiments. We will give a more detailed discussion on the comparison of the two methods. \n\nIn order to have an intuitive understanding of the dimension of features extracted by the “hierarchical sub-network method” and the “fully network FCN method,” we select the dimension of intra-sub-network low-order features and fully network low-order features as the representative to display. In detail, we set the window width parameter as 60 and the step size parameter as 1, which is the combination of sliding window parameters when the intra-sub-network-low-order features have the best performance in ASD classification experiment. \n\nWe can take the area of the feature image as a reference to perceive the dimension of the feature extracted by the two methods. The larger the area, the higher the dimension. In this experiment, the number of ROI in each sub-network is as follows: 18 in SMN, 14 in Visual, 17 in EAN, 22 in DMN, 19 in SBC, and 26 in Cerebel. Each sub-network is shown in order from top to bottom in  . We can see that the intra-sub-network low-order feature dimensions extracted by different sub-networks are, respectively, about 2.41, 1.45, 2.15, 3.60, 2.68, 5.02% of the fully network low-order feature dimensions. Therefore, the “high dimensional but small-sample of RVM” problem is greatly improved in the calculation of fitting multivariate Gaussian distribution in each sub-network. Since the MVND based FCN construction method generates a high-order FCN and a low-order FCN with the same dimensions at one time, the dimension comparison of the high-order FCNs in the two methods is similar to that of the low-order FCNs. Overall, intra-sub-network features are more concise and discriminative than the fully network features. \n  \nThe comparison of the feature dimension in both methods.   (A)   Shows the feature dimension of each sub-network.   (B)   Shows the feature dimension of the fully-network. \n  \nThe results of ASD classification experiments show that: (1) when the high-order and low-order features extracted by the “hierarchical sub-network method” are trained separately, the classification accuracy is higher than that of the “fully network FCN method,” and the classification performance of the “hierarchical sub-network method” is better than that of the “fully network FCN method.” This means that the “hierarchical sub-network method” can capture the FC changes more accurately. There are two factors that play a role together: first, in technology, the dimensionality of the FCN is reduced due to the division of the sub-network, i.e., the dimension decline of RVM, which makes the MVND fitting more accurately. Another factor is about the biological mechanism. The sub-network division of the brain integrates the ROIs which are closely related in function, and focuses on observing the functional connection relationship among the ROIs belonging to the same sub-network, so that the information reflected by the RVM is more concise and effective, and the extracted low-order features and high-order features have a more discriminative power in ASD classification experiment. (2) The fusion of features in each method leads to better classification performance, respectively. To be sure, high-order features and low-order features can provide complementary information, which is the reason why the fusion features have better classification performance in ASD classification experiments. \n\nIn the experiment to explore the influence of sliding window parameters on the classification accuracy, we found that the classification results of the two methods were changed with the combination of window width and step size parameters, especially the window width. Short window width and long window width have their own advantages and disadvantages. Short window width can provide rich short-term dynamic change information, but it is not stable due to the lack of low-frequency cycle ( ). Long window width can make FC estimation more robust ( ). From  , we can see the phenomenon that the maximum classification accuracy can be achieved in the middle length of the window width. In addition, under the same parameter combination, the “hierarchical sub-network method” is almost always more accurate than that of the “fully network FCN method.” Since the dimension of the RVM is lower in each sub-network, more accurate fitting can be obtained. This proves in practice that the superiority of the “hierarchical sub-network method” is not a special result under special conditions. \n\nTo further demonstrate the validity of the “hierarchical sub-network method” in the diagnosis of ASD disease, we trace the sub-network to which the features of the classifier used for training belong. The experimental results showed that features in DMN was selected most frequently, suggesting that DMN was closely related to the pathogenesis of ASD. We found that this conclusion was basically consistent with the conclusion of other studies ( ;  ;  ), and abnormalities of the DMN were commonly regarded as prominent ASD neurobiological features ( ). From a biomedical perspective, DMN plays a crucial role in socially related stimuli because it is involved in the mental state of self-reflective thinking and considering the perspective of others, which is consistent with the fact that ASD is characterized by difficulties in social communication and interaction ( ). Some studies have reported that the widely decreased of the FC in DMN in ASD not only contributes to the core defect of ASD, but also has a significant impact on the symptom severity ( ;  ;  ). For example,   pointed out that the decrease of functional connectivity in DMN of ASD patients was negatively correlated with the severity of social and communication disorders. \n\nIn this study, we choose the medical template as the framework of sub-network division because of its advantage of biological interpretation. Of note, this is not the only scheme for sub-network partition. For example, ROI grouping based on the similarity of rs-fMRI time series can also be used as a sub-network division method. Specifically, k-means algorithm is used to cluster rs-fMRI time series, and the number of sub-networks is determined by specifying the number of clusters. By fixing the number of clusters from 6 to 11, we try to apply the similarity based sub-network division as an alternative to the “hierarchical sub network,” and verify it in the classification experiments of ASD and NC. When the number of clusters is fixed at 8, the classification accuracy gets maximum, and the experimental results are shown in  . In order to distinguish from the existing features, we use “  intra-cluster  ” and “  inter-cluster  ” to represent the intra-sub-network and inter-sub-network features in this method, respectively, and “  Cluster-Fusion  ” to represent the fusion features. From the results, the random division of sub-networks according to the similarity of rs-fMRI time series does not perform better than the existing methods, and as far as we know, this method has two obvious shortcomings: first, although it shows better performance, it cannot make a biological explanation for the results. Second, the number of clusters is not easy to determine which is greatly affected by subjects. \n  \nExperimental results of the application of similarity based sub-network division. \n  \n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis paper proposes a new strategy for mental illness diagnosis based on FCN. The proposed method is based on the following two considerations: Technically, the FCN based on MVND is not well constructed in the fully network domain, and there exists the problem of “high dimension but small sample of RVM.” From the biological point of view, many mental diseases reflect the sub-network property of brain function, and the aggregation of functional linkage makes the diagnosis of diseases more targeted. The results of ASD classification experiments show that the “hierarchical sub-network method” is comparable to the “fully network FCN method,” and the biomedical findings obtained are consistent with other studies. \n\nBesides Pearson’s correlation, we can also utilize other candidates, such as Flexible Least Squares (FLS) method provided by the DynamicBC toolbox, to construct low-order FC network. In comparison with Pearson’s correlation, FLS method has the advantage that more dynamic FC networks can be calculated by avoiding the sliding-window approach. The influence of different low-order FC networks to the performance of high-order FC network will be one of our directions for further study. One limitation of this work is that the ROIs corresponding to the higher-order features cannot be traced in the ASD classification experiment and this makes higher-order features useless for the discovery of ASD lesions. Further exploration of physiological markers of ASD and effective algorithms is our future work. Another limitation is that the “hierarchical sub-network method” could only explore the network-wise inter-network FCs, but would miss the ROI-wise inter-network FCs. How to compensate for the lost FCs with ROI-wise inter-network FCs needs to be further explored. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Shandong Technology and Business University.

However, FC analysis can be seriously affected by random and structured noise from non-neural sources, such as physiology. Thus, it is essential to first reduce thermal noise and then correctly identify and remove non-neural artifacts from rs-fMRI signals through optimized data processing methods. However, existing tools that correct for these effects have been developed for human brain and are not readily transposable to rat data. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to establish a data processing pipeline that can robustly remove random and structured noise from rat rs-fMRI data. It includes a novel denoising approach based on the Marchenko-Pastur Principal Component Analysis (MP-PCA) method, FMRIB’s ICA-based Xnoiseifier (FIX) for automatic artifact classification and cleaning, and global signal regression (GSR). Our results show that: (I) MP-PCA denoising substantially improves the temporal signal-to-noise ratio, (II) the pre-trained FIX classifier achieves a high accuracy in artifact classification, and (III) both independent component analysis (ICA) cleaning and GSR are essential steps in correcting for possible artifacts and minimizing the within-group variability in control animals while maintaining typical connectivity patterns. Reduced within-group variability also facilitates the exploration of potential between-group FC changes, as illustrated here in a rat model of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nResting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) based on spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the resting brain is a widely used non-invasive tool for studying intrinsic functional organization in health and disease ( ;  ). By examining spatio-temporal correlations of the BOLD signal between distinct brain regions, known as functional connectivity (FC), this technique is capable of revealing large-scale resting state networks (RSNs) ( ;  ;  ). Nowadays, rs-fMRI has become an increasingly important translational neuroimaging tool for understanding neurological and psychiatric diseases and for developing treatments, with rapidly growing applications not only in human research but also in rodent models of disease ( ;  ). \n\nHowever, the BOLD signal is contaminated by multiple physiological and non-physiological sources of noise, such as respiratory and cardiac cycles, thermal noise, changes in blood pressure, and head motion ( ;  ;  ;  ). These non-neuronal sources can severely affect rs-fMRI time series and thereby confound the connectivity analysis ( ;  ). Therefore, a robust pre-processing pipeline is required to extract the neuronal component of the BOLD signal and minimize the contribution of such noise sources. Furthermore, existing tools that correct for the effect of non-neuronal sources are mostly tailored for human rs-fMRI data and are not readily transposable, or even applicable, to rodent data. Dedicated pipelines for rodent rs-fMRI processing are just starting to emerge ( ;  ). \n\nFor example, signal fluctuations resulting from respiratory and cardiac cycles can be accounted for by explicitly recording the physiology and modeling these external confounds as regressors ( ;  ). While physiological recordings in rodents are possible, they typically involve dedicated hardware and invasive procedures, making them experimentally difficult. However, although cardiac and respiratory frequencies in rodents are much higher than those of the resting-state BOLD fluctuations, depending on the temporal resolution of the acquisition, they can alias into the band of interest (typically 0.01–0.3 Hz) and corrupt the analysis. Two complementary approaches are, therefore, suitable to mitigate the impact of physiological noise in rodent rs-fMRI. \n\nOne approach is the removal of global signal defined as the mean time series averaged over all voxels within the brain by including the global signal as a nuisance regressor in General Linear Model (GLM) analyses, which is referred to as global signal regression (GSR) ( ). However, the use of GSR has been one of the most controversial topics in human rs-fMRI connectivity studies ( ;  ). On one hand, GSR is known to introduce spurious negative correlations ( ) and cause spatial bias on connectivity measures ( ). On the other hand, prior studies have shown that GSR can enhance the detection of significant FC and improve spatial specificity of positive correlations ( ). Most importantly for rodent studies, GSR can also mitigate confounds related to motion and physiological processes ( ;  ). \n\nAnother commonly used data-driven approach that identifies various physiological noise components directly from the fMRI data itself is single-level independent component analysis (ICA) ( ;  ;  ;  ). The ICA method is also confronted by several issues including model order selection (i.e., the number of components) ( ) and the identification of artifactual components, which is a manually tedious step ( ), especially for a high order model. Notably, a machine-learning approach for automatic artifact component classification based on FMRIB’s ICA-based Xnoiseifier (FIX) ( ) has been proposed to replace manual classification. The FIX auto-classifier applied in human and mice rs-fMRI studies has yielded promising results with a high accuracy in artifact identification ( ,  ;  ). However, the success of FIX classification relies on a proper pre-training on study-specific datasets. \n\nTherefore, the aim of the present study was to propose and evaluate a data processing pipeline for rat rs-fMRI that minimizes intra-group variability and maximizes between-group differences in whole-brain FC. In this pipeline, we reduced structural noise by combining single-session ICA cleaning and GSR. For ICA cleaning, we built and used a dedicated FIX classifier for rats. Furthermore, we enhanced the sensitivity to the BOLD fluctuations by first increasing dramatically the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) of the data. For the purpose of stochastic (thermal) noise removal, we employed a novel method based on Marchenko-Pastur Principal Component Analysis (MP-PCA). MP-PCA denoising was recently introduced for diffusion MRI and is a model-free method that exploits redundancy in MRI series ( ), which has shown great potential for improving the SNR in other MRI techniques as well ( ;  ). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Animal Preparation and Anesthesia \n  \nAll experiments were approved by the local Service for Veterinary Affairs. Male Wistar rats (236 ± 11 g) underwent a bilateral intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of either streptozotocin (3 mg/kg, STZ group) or buffer (control group). When delivered exclusively to the brain, streptozotocin induces impaired brain glucose metabolism and is used as a model of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) ( ;  ;  ). \n\nAs a result of system upgrade, the fMRI data were acquired on two rat cohorts (1/2) on different MRI consoles (Varian/Bruker). We refer to animals scanned on the Varian system as Cohort 1 (  N   = 17 rats) and to animals scanned on the Bruker system as Cohort 2 (  N   = 7 rats). Each cohort comprised animals from both groups: Cohort 1 (CTL/STZ,   N   = 8/9 rats) and Cohort 2 (CTL/STZ,   N   = 4/3 rats), which were scanned at 2, 6, 13, and 21 weeks after the surgery ( ). Rats were anesthetized using 2% isoflurane in a mixture of O  and air (O /air: 30/70) during the initial setup and promptly switched to medetomidine sedation delivered through a subcutaneous catheter in the back (bolus: 0.1 mg/kg, perfusion: 0.1 mg/kg/h) as previously described ( ). Medetomidine preserves neural activity and vascular response better than isoflurane ( ;  ;  ). The rat head was fixed using a homemade holder with a bite bar and ear bars to minimize the head motion, and body temperature and breathing rate were continuously monitored. At the end of the scanning sessions, rats were woken up with an intra-muscular injection of antagonist atipamezole (0.5 mg/kg) and returned to their cages. \n  \nTimeline of experiments. Two fMRI runs were acquired per rat for each experiment. Figure adapted from  , NeuroImage 2021, with permission. \n  \n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nMagnetic resonance imaging experiments were conducted on a 14.1 T small animal scanner with two different consoles: Varian system (Varian Inc.) equipped with 400 mT/m gradients (Cohort 1) and Bruker system (Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with 1 T/m gradients (Cohort 2), both using an in-house built quadrature surface transceiver. The acquisition parameters were the same for the two cohorts. \n\nAn anatomical reference scan was acquired using a fast spin-echo multi-slice sequence with the following parameters: TE/TR = 10.17/3000 ms, ETL = 4, TE  = 10.17 ms, field of view (FOV) = 19.2 mm × 19.2 mm, matrix = 128 × 128, in-plane resolution = 150 μm × 150 μm, number of slices = 30, and thickness = 0.5 mm. Before running the fMRI sequence, anesthesia was switched from isoflurane to medetomidine. The fMRI acquisitions were started after a fixed duration (∼1 h) since the switch from isoflurane to medetomidine to minimize between-animal anesthesia-related confounds. Rs-fMRI data were acquired using a two-shot gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence as follows: TE = 10 ms, TR = 800 ms, TR  = 1.6 s, FOV = 23 mm × 23 mm, matrix = 64 × 64, in-plane resolution = 360 μm × 360 μm, 8 slices, thickness = 1.12 mm, and 370 repetitions (∼10 min). Two fMRI runs were acquired for each rat. A short scan with 10 repetitions and reversed phase-encoding direction was also acquired to correct for EPI-related geometric distortions. \n\n\n### FMRI Data Pre-processing \n  \nOur data processing pipeline was developed based on the data of Cohort 1. \n\nAnatomical and fMRI images were first skull-stripped separately using BET (Brain Extraction Tool; FSL)  ( ), and fMRI time series were denoised using MP-PCA with a 5 × 5 × 5 voxel sliding kernel ( ). The quality of MP-PCA denoising was assessed by inspecting the normality of the residuals (original – denoised) and the tSNR changes before and after denoising. Specifically, the normality of the residuals was tested by the linearity of the relationship between the natural logarithm of the residual distribution probability and the squares of multiple residual standard deviation. Then, the datasets went through EPI distortion correction using FSL’s topup ( ), slice-timing correction ( ;  ;  ), and spatial smoothing (Gaussian kernel: 0.36 mm × 0.36 mm × 1 mm). Corrected fMRI images were registered to the Waxholm Space Atlas of the rat brain  using linear and non-linear registration in ANTs ( ). Highly parcelated atlas labels were grouped to yield larger, anatomically consistent, labels [e.g., all sub-regions pertaining to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were grouped into one ACC label], and 28 atlas-defined regions of interest (ROIs, 14 per hemisphere) were thus automatically segmented. The brain mask extracted based on EPI images was used to mask atlas labels in fMRI space such that only regions with sufficient signal were included and areas of drop-out were excluded. \n\nFinally, single-session ICA was performed on fMRI time courses using FSL’s MELODIC ( ) with high-pass temporal filtering (  f   > 0.01 Hz) and 40 independent components (ICs). \n\n\n### FIX Training \n  \nDatasets of Cohort 1 were randomly split into two groups: a training dataset for FIX (  n   = 49) and a test dataset (  n   = 58). The ICA components in the training dataset were manually classified to signal or artifact, which was mainly based on thresholded spatial maps because ICA is theoretically more robust in the spatial than in the temporal domain ( ;  ). Generally speaking, spatial maps of signal components should contain a low number of anatomically consistent clusters, whereas artifactual components typically have either very large clusters covering brain slices or very small and scattered clusters ( ). Here, we chose an “aggressive” artifact removal ( ) in the training dataset in order to give the trained classifier a margin to be conservative or aggressive   via   adjusting the threshold fed to it (small thresholds make it conservative). \n\nThe performance of the trained classifier in detecting artifactual components was evaluated on the test dataset by comparing the automatic classification of artifactual components with the manual classification. The classification accuracy was characterized in terms of “recall” and “precision” ( ), which are defined as the percentage of the correctly predicted artifact components in all actual artifact components and the percentage of the correctly predicted artifact components in all predicted artifact components, respectively. \n\n\n### Network Analysis and GSR \n  \nAfter ICA decomposition and classification, the artifactual components were regressed out of the 4D pre-processed datasets to obtain “cleaned” rs-fMRI datasets. The cleaned data were used to compute ROI-to-ROI FC by calculating correlation coefficients between the ROI-averaged time series of the 28 atlas-defined ROIs, resulting in a 28 × 28 FC matrix for each rat. \n\nFor FIX, we relied on spatial maps rather than time courses to evaluate artifactual components. In several cases, components displayed sensible spatial distribution to represent a RSN, but the power spectrum showed a peak at a frequency that could be attributed to breathing ( ) (the breathing rate was recorded for each run and its aliased frequency within our 0.01–0.31 Hz band was calculated). These non-neuronal sources that could not be cleaned using FIX also contribute to the global signal. To mitigate their effect, we used the partial correlation of ROI-to-ROI time courses to build FC matrices, with the global signal as the controlling variable. For every pair of ROIs, the partial correlation was implemented by measuring the correlation between their time-series residuals, after each having been adjusted by the GSR ( ). \n\nFinally, statistical comparisons of FC between the STZ and CTL groups at each timepoint were performed using NBS ( ) to identify network connections that showed significant between-group difference. Specifically, NBS uses one-tailed two-sample   t  -test to detect differences in group-averaged FC between the two groups. Thereby, two contrasts (  STZ   >   CTL   and   STZ   <   CTL  ) were tested separately. A   t  -statistic threshold was chosen on the basis of medium-to-large sizes of the subnetwork comprised connections with their   t  -statistic above the threshold ( ) as well as the underlying   p  -values. Here, we chose 2.2 as the   t  -statistic threshold. Results based on other thresholds are provided as  . Significance (  p   ≤ 0.05) was tested after family wise error rate (FWER) correction using non-parametric permutation (  N   = 5000). \n\nThe full data processing pipeline is illustrated in  . \n  \nThe proposed pipeline for rs-fMRI data processing. \n  \n\n### Pipeline Evaluation on Cohort 1 \n  \nTo evaluate the rs-fMRI data processing pipeline including MP-PCA denoising (DN), slice-timing correction (SC), spatial smoothing (SM), high-pass filtering (HP), ICA-FIX cleaning (CL), and GSR in terms of consistency of within-group FC in the healthy CTL group and in terms of between-group difference, we compared results of the PIRACY (Pipeline for Rat Connectivity) pipeline (DN + CL + GSR, pipeline G) with other processing approaches depending on the presence of DN, CL, and GSR in addition to the baseline pipeline (SC + SM + HP, pipeline A), namely, GSR (pipeline B), CL + GSR (pipeline C), DN (pipeline D), DN + CL (pipeline E), and DN + GSR (pipeline F) in Cohort 1, shown in  . \n  \nThe seven data processing pipelines and methods they include (“×” – including, “∘” – excluding). \n    \nBased on the hypothesis that an optimal processing procedure should minimize the variability within the homogeneous group of healthy controls ( ), the within-group variability was assessed by calculating the standard deviation of the Fisher   z  -transformed correlation coefficients of the FC matrices in the CTL group of healthy rats at each timepoint. In addition, the sensitivity to between-group differences was evaluated by comparing the significant difference in FC between the STZ and CTL groups at each timepoint. \n\n\n### Group ICA Analysis \n  \nAt each timepoint, group-level ICA was performed using FSL’s Melodic ( ) on the pooled CTL and STZ datasets of Cohort 1 that were pre-processed using pipeline E (no GSR). Prior to group-level ICA in Melodic, all the rs-fMRI datasets from a given timepoint were registered to a common template using ANTs ( ), and the template registration in Melodic was by-passed. Thirty group-level spatial ICs were extracted. The selection of IC number is a trade-off between biological detail (small and refined networks) and noise (too many components that can be supported by data quality) ( ).   N   = 30 or 40 components are common for rodent group ICA ( ;  ;  ). In our case,   N   = 30 had the advantage of yielding a similar number of nodes to the ROI-to-ROI FC analysis for the network analyses. Dual regression ( ) was used to estimate subject-specific time courses and associated spatial maps. Similar to the ROI-based FC analysis, ICA-based FC matrices were built by calculating correlation coefficients between all pairs of time courses (excluding artifact components) using FSLNets ( ). Both full correlation (original Pearson’s correlation) and partial correlation with GSR (mean time course as regressor) were employed by FSLNets to evaluate the similarity between time courses. In the end, differences in FC between the STZ and CTL groups were tested using the NBS toolbox using the same parameters in the Network Analysis and GSR section. \n\n\n### Pipeline Evaluation on Cohort 2 \n  \nTo test the robustness of the proposed pipeline, we further evaluated it on the independent datasets of Cohort 2. Similarly, we compared results of the PIRACY pipeline G (DN + CL + GSR) with three other processing pipelines: DN (D), DN + CL (E), and DN + GSR (F) in terms of the within-group variability for the control rats of Cohort 2. Then, we assessed the between-group differences in FC between the STZ and CTL groups on the pooled datasets of Cohorts 1 and 2. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nTo experimentally evaluate the processing pipeline, a total of 109 rs-fMRI datasets (Cohort 1) were acquired from 17 rats at four timepoints ranging from 2 to 21 weeks ( ). Two datasets with bad image quality were discarded.   shows the MR images in one representative dataset including rs-fMRI images, matching anatomical reference, and the atlas-based anatomical labels registered to the fMRI images. \n  \nExample of rs-fMRI images of eight coronal slices   (A)  , matching anatomical MR images   (B)  , and atlas-based anatomical labels registered to the fMRI images   (C)  . \n  \nTo assess the robustness of the PIRACY pipeline, an independent cohort with 56 rs-fMRI datasets was acquired from seven different rats at four timepoints ranging from 2 to 21 weeks ( ). \n\n### MP-PCA Denoising \n  \nThe average tSNR after MP-PCA denoising improved significantly for all the 107 datasets.   shows an example of the average tSNR increase from 75 to 146 after MP-PCA denoising, residuals map, histogram, and the normality test. The linearity of log(P) =   f  (r ) confirms that the residuals are normally distributed and only Gaussian noise has been removed from the signal. Moreover, the number of components classified as artifacts decreased, whereas the   z  -statistic for signal components increased when MP-PCA denoising was applied prior to ICA decomposition ( ). \n  \nExample of temporal SNR maps, before   (A)   and after MP-PCA denoising   (B)  . The mean tSNR over the middle brain slice was improved dramatically from 75 to 146. The SNR profile is typical of a surface coil placed on top of the head, with higher sensitivity in the cortex.

Thresholded IC maps in   (B)   were given by FSL’s MELODIC. \n  \n\n### FIX Classification \n  \nHere, we preferred a lower order model to avoid overfitting ( ;  ), and we chose the number of ICs to be 40, which typically explained 90% of the variance. Notably, reaching 95% of explained variance would have required about 90 components, which would potentially cause over-splitting networks and making the classification more complicated. \n\nThe single-subject ICA was performed on each dataset with 40 components. In the training dataset (  n   = 49), 19.8 ± 4.7 components (50%) were classified as artifacts by hand. In the test dataset (  n   = 58), between 40 and 64% of components were classified as artifacts automatically by FIX depending on the threshold. More components could be recognized as artifacts by increasing the FIX threshold at the expense of lowering the classification precision due to more misclassification. Here, 45 might be an “optimal” threshold with overall 88% in recall and 90% in precision achieved ( ). In practice, we ran FIX twice with a low and high threshold, respectively. We then examined only the components differing between the two artifact lists given by the two FIX thresholds and manually restored the true noise components. This represented nonetheless a significant gain in processing time, as we only needed to classify one third of the ICA components by hand. \n  \nFIX artifact classification accuracies at different thresholds. \n    \n\n### Comparison of Pipeline Performance \n  \nThe seven data processing pipelines (A–G) were first compared based on resulting FC matrices of 28 atlas-based ROIs in Cohort 1. \n\nPipelines C and G that include both CL and GSR yielded lower within-group variability in the homogeneous group of healthy controls for all timepoints than other procedures excluding CL and/or GSR ( ). The combination of CL + GSR also corrected for physiological artifacts that CL or GSR alone could not systematically address ( ). Furthermore, our proposed pipeline G (DN + CL + GSR) yielded between-group differences most consistently at 2, 6, and 13 weeks, whereas pipeline C (without DN) only detected between-group differences at 2 and 6 weeks. No significant difference was found between the CTL and STZ groups for the baseline pipeline A and pipeline D (only DN). Pipeline E (DN + CL) exhibited numerous different edges at 6 weeks and none at the other timepoints, whereas pipelines B and F (GSR or DN + GSR) yielded numerous different edges at 6 and 21 weeks but none at 2 and 13 weeks ( ). \n  \nStandard deviation of the Fisher   z  -transformed correlation coefficient for functional connectivity in the CTL group of Cohort 1 at four different timepoints for the seven pipelines   (A–G)  . Pipelines including CL and GSR   (C,G)   obtained the minimal within-group variability in the homogeneous group of healthy controls for all timepoints, whereas other procedures excluding CL and/or GSR had higher variability. \n    \nExample FC matrices of two control rats scanned at 2 weeks (Subjects 1 and 2) processed with four different pipelines   (D–G)  . For Subject 1, GSR alone (pipeline   F  ) reinforces a widespread anti-correlation between the left and right hemispheres, manifest in a checkerboard pattern (odd/even rows and columns correspond to the left/right hemisphere ROIs, respectively) that was otherwise removed by ICA cleaning (pipeline   E  ). For Subject 2, GSR alone does not attenuate very strong positive/negative correlation blocks spanning large portions of the brain, whereas ICA cleaning alone yields artificially high whole-brain connectivity. The combination of CL + GSR (pipeline   G  ) mitigates these effects in both examples and yields more consistent between-subject connectivity matrices. \n    \nSignificant differences in FC between the CTL and STZ groups of Cohort 1 at each timepoint (2, 6, 13, and 21 weeks) for each data processing approach under NBS threshold 2.2. No significant difference was found between the CTL and STZ groups for the baseline pipeline   (A)   and pipeline   (D)   (DN only), whereas significant differences were only found at 6 weeks for pipeline   (E)   (DN + CL, no GSR). Pipelines   (B,F)   (GSR, or DN + GSR) had similar results with between-group differences detected at 6 and 21 weeks. Pipeline   (G)   (DN + CL + GSR) most consistently yielded between-group differences across timepoints, whereas pipeline   (C)   (CL + GSR, no DN) only detected significant differences at two timepoints. Blue edges indicate group differences in contrast 1 (  STZ   >   CTL  ), and red edges indicate group differences in contrast 2 (  STZ   <   CTL  ).   p   and   p   are FWER corrected   p  -values for contrast 1 and contrast 2, respectively. Green nodes indicate ROIs involved in group differences. \n  \n\n### ROI-Based FC Analysis \n  \nTo analyze group differences in connectivity obtained following the PIRACY pipeline G, a more detailed visualization is provided in  .

Nodes with altered connectivity in STZ animals were consistent with regions affected by AD and with previous findings on this animal model ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). At 2 weeks, increased positive connectivity of the ACC to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and decreased anti-correlations of the default mode network (DMN) including the ACC, RSC, posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and hippocampus (Hip/Sub) to the lateral cortical network (LCN) involving somatosensory (S1) as well as motor (M) were found. The 6-week timepoint showed widespread reduced anti-correlations between the DMN (including the RSC, PPC, Hip), somatosensory of the LCN, and striatum (Str). At 13 weeks, weaker positive correlations were found within the DMN involving not only the ACC, PPC, RSC, Hip, medial temporal lobe (MTL), and visual cortex (V) but also the hypothalamus (HTh) to the DMN. \n  \n (A)   Hybrid average FC matrices at each timepoint (top-right half: STZ, bottom-left half: CTL) based on the data of Cohort 1 processed by the optimized pipeline G.  :   p   < 0.05 (FWER corrected) at threshold of 2.2.

Artifactual components were identified and removed, which resulted in 28, 25, 25, and 26 signal components left for the four timepoints, respectively.   displays the significant between-group differences in partial correlations with GSR between ICA components. The complete list of edges with significant between-group differences is provided as  . Remarkably, group ICA analysis with GSR showed intergroup differences at three timepoints from 2 to 13 weeks, in agreement with differences found in ROI-based FC analysis using pipeline G. At 2 weeks, most changes were found in connections between the RSC, PPC, Hip, thalamus (Tha), and S1/2. At 6 weeks, there were alterations found in connectivity involving the PPC, Hip, RSC, S1/2, Str, as well as Tha. At 13 weeks, primary changes were detected in connections between the Hip, S1, Str, Tha, and HTh. Full correlation between ICA components–an equivalent to pipeline E: DN + CL–revealed significant differences at all timepoints ( ), in poor agreement with the ROI-based FC analysis using pipeline E, which only identified group differences at one timepoint (6 weeks). This inconsistency may indicate the importance of GSR in obtaining consistent intergroup differences. \n  \nBetween-group differences in ICA-based functional connectivity with GSR (partial correlation) at NBS threshold of 2.2 for each timepoint in Cohort 1.

The nodes of ICs are listed in an order based on its position in the brain (anterior to posterior). ROI labels are attached to every ICA component. Artifactual components were removed, and the IC number was reordered accordingly.

Moreover, between-group differences in FC in the combined datasetCohorts 1 + 2 ( ) were consistent with that in Cohort 1 alone ( ), in a pattern of initial hyperconnectivity and later hypoconnectivity from 2 to 13 weeks. At 21 weeks, Cohort 1 alone was likely underpowered due to missing datasets, and no group differences were reported with pipeline G. The combination of Cohorts 1 + 2 enabled to reveal widespread hypoconnectivity in STZ at 21 weeks (see   for a detailed comparison of significant edges for Cohort 1 and Cohorts 1 + 2 at all timepoints). In contrast, group differences as highlighted by pipelines E (DN + CL) and F (DN + GSR) showed less consistency between Cohort 1 and Cohorts 1 + 2, with dramatic changes in outcome at 6 weeks particularly. \n  \nStandard deviation of the Fisher   z  -transformed correlation coefficient for functional connectivity in the CTL group of Cohort 2 at four different timepoints for four pipelines   (D–G)   all including DN.

We built a dedicated FIX ICA classifier for rat brain that showed a high accuracy in distinguishing artifactual ICA components from the rs-fMRI signal after training. We evaluated the performance of the proposed pipeline by comparing it to six other possible approaches that excluded denoising, artifact cleaning, and/or GSR. We further evaluated the pipeline on separate datasets from an independent cohort. We showed that these three steps were essential in minimizing the within-group variability in the healthy control group. Differences between a control group and a diseased group using the STZ animal model were found more consistently across timepoints with pipeline G and were also more consistent between different analysis approaches: ROI-to-ROI FC or group-level ICA. \n\nWe included a novel thermal noise reduction method based on MP-PCA applied to rs-fMRI data that substantially improved the tSNR, resulting in fewer artifactual components to be cleaned in the ICA decomposition, and improved the statistical strength and anatomical consistency of components classified as signal. While the MP-PCA denoising technique was initially implemented for diffusion MRI data ( ), it has recently also shown great value for task fMRI ( ), and it is also applicable to rs-fMRI. Indeed, resting-state neural activity may appear as random temporal events, but it falls into a specific 0.01–0.3 Hz frequency range, which makes it discernible from white Gaussian thermal noise, with a flat power spectral density. This feature is apparent in the normality test ( ) for the residuals of MP-PCA denoising. Furthermore, denoising is performed within a sliding window of 5 × 5 × 5 voxels, within which the BOLD fluctuations are likely to be correlated (cluster), whereas the thermal noise is not. Thus, the thermal noise reduction using the MP-PCA approach is very unlikely to remove the genuine BOLD fluctuations and, on the contrary, will improve the sensitivity of the analysis for the latter, as is apparent from the ICA decomposition with and without denoising ( ). \n\nIt is often suggested that ICA also has denoising properties ( ;  ), which need be clarified. On one hand, if just a few artifactual components are removed from the signal (as in FIX cleaning), the effect of ICA is primarily to remove structured noise, and not thermal (random) noise. On the other hand, if the ICA decomposition is used to keep and examine just a few ICs that appear anatomically consistent with RSNs, then indeed most of thermal noise is also removed in that process ( ). However, group-level ICA suffers from its own limitations ( ) and is not necessarily the appropriate analysis tool for all studies, and seed-based analyses are expected to benefit greatly from prior denoising using MP-PCA. Another study using MP-PCA denoising prior to task fMRI analysis reported an increase of 60% in SNR and improved statistics and extent of the activation ( ). \n\nInterestingly, MP-PCA denoising alone or even combining with GSR had almost no effect in reducing intra-group variability ( , columns D, F vs. A), and it also had no contribution to the detection of between-group difference in pipelines D and F compared with the variants without it (pipelines A and B,  ). \n\nHead motion during fMRI acquisitions is one of the major confounding factors that leads to artificial correlation compromising the interpretation of rs-fMRI data ( ;  ). However, compared with human studies where head motion is common, rodent studies are less impacted by this confound due to the restraint achieved by a fixation setup with ear bars and a bite bar and the use of anesthesia ( ). In our datasets, no apparent head motion was observed by visual inspection of time courses except for two datasets, which were discarded. Moreover, based on the framewise displacement (FD) analysis ( ), head motion in our rat datasets was extremely small with displacements less than 1 μm (<0.3% of voxel size) for 75% datasets and less than 7 μm (<2% of voxel size) for all ( ), whereas in human data, it is on the order of several tenths of a millimeter (∼5–10% of voxel size) ( ). Motion correction was, therefore, skipped in the proposed data processing pipeline since it has been shown to introduce spurious correlations ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThe FIX-based artifact auto-classification has already been applied in human and mouse fMRI datasets ( ;  ). In this work, this automatic artifact removal approach was for the first time implemented for rat data. After being trained in a manually classified dataset, the classifier showed a high accuracy in identifying artifact components from rs-fMRI signal in an untouched test dataset. Nonetheless,   shows that there is a trade-off between the recall and precision in the fully automatic classification of artifact components, which means that it is not possible to achieve both very high recall and precision with one FIX threshold. However, in practice, this problem could be addressed by half automated classification in which two auto-classifications are first performed with, respectively, low and high thresholds (20 and 70 for instance), and then the difference between their two artifact lists are manually examined. In this way, by manually classifying a small portion of ICA components (∼24%), we were able to achieve a very high classification accuracy in a short time. Note that the training set was cleaned aggressively in order to give flexibility in aggressiveness/conservatism for test datasets by adjusting the threshold. This classifier is available along with the rest of the pipeline code . The impact of ICA cleaning alone on individual datasets suggested that this approach is not sufficient for a comprehensive mitigation of artifacts in rat rs-fMRI data ( ). \n\nAlthough controversial, GSR is still commonly used in the analysis of rs-fMRI data ( ) due to its capability of reducing the effects of respiration and motion on FC estimates ( ;  ;  ) and enhancing the spatial specificity of positive correlations ( ). Here, we found that pipelines B and F that included GSR but no CL had little effect in reducing intra-group variability compared with the baseline protocol A and could also not systematically address pronounced artifacts in individual connectivity matrices. However, combined with ICA-based cleaning, GSR reduced most within-group variability in the healthy CTL group for both Cohorts 1 and 2 and revealed differences in connectivity between the CTL and STZ groups most consistently across timepoints. The benefits of CL + GSR have previously been highlighted in human fMRI data to strengthen the association between FC and behavior ( ). \n\nTaken separately, minimizing within-group variability could favor pipelines that wipe out any relevant information-carrying signal while favoring widespread between-group differences could select a pipeline with the highest false-positive rate. Satisfying both criteria concomitantly though prevents either scenario. As far as low intra-group variability being potentially a signature of over-cleaning, we underline that the average FC in the control group ( , bottom left halves of each matrix) displays expected features of strong inter-hemispheric connectivity between L/R regions as well as, for instance, anti-correlation between midline regions of the DMN and the sensorimotor system, as previously reported ( ), which argue in favor of preserving expected baseline FC with our optimized pipeline. As mentioned, MP-PCA denoising results in more clear-cut ICA decomposition where fewer components are labeled as structural noise and removed. Over-cleaning is perhaps instead manifest in the pipeline variant without MP-PCA denoising (pipeline C: ICA cleaning + GSR) that achieved the minimal intra-group variability due to more ICs being labeled as structured noise and removed (see  ). The positive influence of MP-PCA denoising on downstream ICA decomposition and identification of stronger and cleaner RSNs suggests that such an approach may also be beneficial for identifying relevant variability within a control group ( ). \n\nA pipeline’s ability to reveal true group differences assumes that such true differences exist, which may be challenging to ascertain. First, we underline that the proposed PIRACY pipeline revealed group differences consistently across timepoints and across integration of additional datasets (Cohort 2) to the initial Cohort 1. In contrast, other pipelines either revealed no differences at all (without CL nor GSR) or differences that were inconsistent across timepoints and across dataset pooling, and thereby indeed pointed to false positives. For example, pipeline E (DN + CL) showed overwhelming group differences only at 6 weeks (Cohort 1), which disappeared in Cohort 1 + 2 analysis, and nothing otherwise. Pipeline F (DN + GSR) showed no differences at 2 and 13 weeks and overwhelming group differences at 6 and 21 weeks (Cohort 1), with only the latter being sustained in the Cohort 1 + 2 analysis. \n\nIn terms of the reliability of the differences pointed by the PIRACY pipeline, while false positives cannot be excluded due to the relatively small sample size, we stress that group differences were indeed expected at all chosen timepoints and the pattern that PIRACY showcased for these changes agreed with previous literature on this animal model assessed from histology, behavior, and volumetry ( ;  ;  ). The FC analysis resulting from Cohort 1 and its pertinence with respect to the animal model and to AD have been published separately ( ). Briefly, STZ rats in Cohort 1 exhibited not only altered FC but also intra-axonal damage and demyelination (assessed using diffusion MRI) in brain regions typical of AD, in a temporal pattern of acute injury, transient recovery/compensation, and chronic degeneration. The non-monotonic pattern in FC changes was characterized by initial hyper-connectivity and impaired network dissociation, followed by later hypo-connectivity, consistent with patterns found in pre-clinical AD and mild cognitive impairment ( ;  ). The switch occurred between the 6- and 13-week timepoints. FC in the CTL group was consistent with previous reports that midline regions of the DMN are anti-correlated with the sensorimotor system ( ). In STZ animals, these anti-correlations between DMN and LCN were initially reduced (2 and 6 weeks), suggesting less efficient network dissociation and brain processing ( ). Concomitantly, hyperconnectivity within the DMN was found in STZ rats at these early timepoints. By 13 weeks, however, STZ rats exhibited reduced connectivity (or hypoconnectivity) in regions typically involved in AD, also consistent with eventual memory impairment in this animal model and reduced FC in AD patients ( ;  ). While Cohort 1 had too few datasets at 21 weeks to identify group differences, the combination of Cohorts 1 + 2 in the context of the current work revealed patterns of sustained inter-hemispheric hypoconnectivity particularly between posterior brain and DMN regions at this timepoint. In the context of sustained glucose hypometabolism, these non-monotonic trends–also reported in behavioral studies of this animal model ( ) as well as in human AD ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  )–suggest a compensatory mechanism, possibly recruiting ketone bodies, that allows a partial and temporary repair of brain structure and function. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nFirst, free breathing of animals was chosen as an easier setup, best suited for longitudinal studies. While it certainly brings in higher respiratory variations to fMRI data than artificial ventilation, the breathing rate was carefully monitored and was relatively stable during the 10′ of fMRI acquisition. Breathing fluctuations were further mitigated at the level of ICA cleaning and GSR. Second, animals breathed a consistent mixture of air and oxygen, but SpO  was not monitored. While we did maintain a strictly consistent experimental protocol throughout the study in terms of gas mixture, anesthesia levels, and timings, varying SpO  levels might confound the BOLD signal and thereby the results. We note, however, that a recent meta-analysis has shown that, even when blood gas levels are monitored, their impact on the BOLD signal is not consistent/systematic across studies ( ), which makes it difficult to account for. Finally, how our findings generalize to completely different datasets, particularly in terms of disease model, remains to be investigated. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe conclude that the PIRACY processing pipeline for rat rs-fMRI data proposed herein, which includes MP-PCA denoising, a FIX auto-classification and cleaning of structured artifacts uncovered by ICA, and GSR, allowed to greatly reduce the within-group variability and improve the detection of between-group differences at the same time. This data processing pipeline, therefore, has strong potential to improve the sensitivity and reproducibility of rs-fMRI studies on rat models of disease and injury. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe pipeline code and FIX rat classifier are available at  .

However, their association with the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition (E/I-B), which is closely related to the activities of glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the receptor availability (RA) of GABA  and mGluR5, remains unexplored. This research investigates these associations during the resting state (RS) condition using simultaneously recorded PET/MR/EEG (trimodal) data. The trimodal data were acquired from three studies using different radio-tracers such as, [ C]ABP688 (ABP) (  N   = 9), [ C]Flumazenil (FMZ) (  N   = 10) and 2-[ F]fluoro-2-deoxy- -glucose (FDG) (  N   = 10) targeted to study the mGluR5, GABA  receptors and glucose metabolism respectively. Glucose metabolism and neuroreceptor binding availability (non-displaceable binding potential (BP )) of GABA  and mGluR5 were found to be significantly higher and closely linked within core resting-state networks (RSNs). The neuronal generators of EEG microstates and the fMRI measures were most tightly associated with the BP  of GABA  relative to mGluR5 BP  and the glucose metabolism, emphasising a predominance of inhibitory processes within in the core RSNs at rest. Changes in the neuroreceptors leading to an altered coupling with glucose metabolism may render the RSNs vulnerable to psychiatric conditions. The paradigm employed here will likely help identify the precise neurobiological mechanisms behind these alterations in fMRI functional connectivity and EEG oscillations, potentially benefitting individualised healthcare treatment measures. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIt is generally acknowledged that the functional architecture of the brain is governed by fundamental principles such as functional segregation and integration . Functional integration (both intrinsic and induced) in the brain is directed by the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition and is closely related to activity in the brain’s main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), respectively . This excitatory/inhibitory balance (E/I-B) has been shown to play an important role in several crucial mental processes . It is postulated that this balance is the underlying mechanism influencing both intrinsic and stimulus-induced activity across brain regions and may also play a role in the constitution of the higher cognitive functions, such as self and consciousness . Conversely, disturbances in the E/I-B may lead to functional network alterations and have been shown to provide the underlying pathological framework in some psychiatric diseases . Thus, a profound understanding of the neurobiological basis of the E/I-B remains a major scientific challenge and a deeper comprehension of it would offer greater insight into psychiatric diseases. \n\nThe E/I-B has been extensively investigated at the cellular level of neural activity but remains less well described at the more complex levels where it becomes interspersed with various aspects of brain function. Details relating to the mechanistic aspects of the E/I-B are assessable using different neuroimaging methods, with each method providing information pertaining to a somewhat different aspect of neural activity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) records the haemodynamic response—the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast—which is likely to be driven by balanced proportional changes in the excitation and inhibition of neurons . Multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) reflects voltage changes resulting from the synchronous firing of groups of neurons in the brain and thus mainly exposes the neuroelectric activity at the synapse. Positron emission tomography (PET) uses specific radioligands to visualise and quantify a variety of metabolic and physiological processes in vivo by short-living positron-emitting radioisotopes (like  C,  F) used to label biological molecules or drugs . One of the metabolic parameters derived from PET imaging includes non-displaceable binding potential (BP ) , which specifically indicates the receptor availability (RA) depending on the used tracer. \n\nAlone, each of these techniques provides valuable insight into the examined processes in terms of its own frame of reference. However, each technique is also constrained by its own limitations. In recent years, the development of a combined approach—simultaneous trimodal PET–MR–EEG imaging —has enabled the measurement of different aspects of the same process as it occurs, under the same physiological and psychological conditions, shedding valuable light on the relationship between them. Thus, this simultaneous trimodal approach is suitable to elucidate the coupling between neuronal activities, energy consumption, oscillations and the E/I-B. \n\nTo date, our investigations using simultaneous trimodal MR–PET–EEG imaging have mainly focused on the default mode network (DMN), as this is the first described and one of the most prominent resting-state networks (RSNs), containing brain regions critical for several cognitive functions. Using the trimodal approach, it was possible to demonstrate a significantly higher glucose metabolism (quantified by a 2-[ F]fluoro-2-deoxy- -glucose PET (FDG-PET)) in the DMN compared to the whole-brain non-DMN grey matter (GM) during resting state (RS) . Further, the neuronal activation within the DMN (as assessed with fMRI) was positively correlated with the metabolic activity (assessed as the mean standard uptake value of FDG). Electrical source localisation of EEG signals also showed a unique frequency range pattern. \n\nIn another investigation, a more detailed clarification of the associations between the EEG signals and the ongoing glucose energy metabolism during rest was sought by specifically focussing on EEG microstates . The spatial distribution of active neuronal sites that contribute to electrical activity in the brain can be revealed using EEG scalp topographies. Such topographies are found to be quasi-stable for periods of about 80–120 ms . RS EEG studies have consistently identified four topographies (usually labelled as A–D) , and each of these topographies is named as a “microstate map” . The orientation of the four microstate maps are right-frontal left-posterior (A), left-frontal right-posterior (B), midline frontal-occipital (C), and midline frontal (D). The functional interpretation of microstate map assumes that each map (topography) is generated by diverse neuronal assemblies. Their locations can be estimated using source localisation techniques, such as the standard low-resolution brain electrotomography (sLORETA) . The transition of microstate maps may be regarded as a sequential activation of various neuronal assemblies. Van De Ville et al. have indicated the microstates as being “atoms of thought” (the shortest constituting elements of cognition) . A small number of studies have investigated the relationship between EEG microstates and RS-fMRI using simultaneously recorded RS-EEG and fMRI, and have highlighted the four typical microstates likely to represent the RSNs usually identified in RS-fMRI studies . With our own trimodal approach, we demonstrated previously tight associations between fMRI metrics, FDG-PET standard uptake values and the single microstates, indicating a functional relationship between cortical hubs, connectivity parameters and the glucose metabolism . \n\nHowever, the understanding of these complex inter-connections in the context of the E/I-B is very sparse. As the EEG microstates from large-scale neural networks are a result of synaptic electrical activity due to the excitatory and inhibitory actions of the neurotransmitters, we hypothesise that the neuronal generators of EEG microstates are tightly associated not only with the functional connectivity measures and glucose metabolism but also with the availability of the neuroreceptors relevant for the E/I-B. Thus, we have chosen the following two receptors as representatives of the E/I-B for our investigation: the excitatory G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5) and the inhibitory, ligand-gated, ion-specific GABA  receptor. For their quantification within the PET part of the trimodal MR–PET–EEG imaging, two selective radioligands were used to determine the RA: [ C]ABP688 (ABP) for mGluR5  and [ C]-Flumazenil (FMZ) for GABA  receptors . Further, 2-[ F]-fluoro-2-desoxy- -glucose (FDG) was used to study glucose metabolism. During each of these three separate investigations, fMRI and EEG data were assessed simultaneously with identical protocols. The data obtained were analysed jointly in an explorative approach to address the following questions:   \nTo what extent does the E/I-B (expressed as the RA of mGluR5 and GABA ) and the glucose metabolism measured via FDG-PET determine the activity of the neuroelectric generators of microstates as estimated by sLORETA during RS? \n  \nIs the previously shown higher metabolic activity within the DMN during the RS associated with a higher RA of the mGluR5 and GABA  as an expression of the higher energy demand to maintain the E/I-B in the RS? \n  \nIn view of the tight association of the neuronal activity (regardless of whether excitatory and inhibitory) with the glucose metabolism, is there a link between the RA of the mGluR5 and GABA  and the glucose metabolism measured via FDG-PET? \n  \nIn light of the known modulatory effect of the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission on the BOLD signal , is there an association between the RS functional connectivity and the RA of mGluR5 and GABAA within the RSNs? \n  \n\nRS-fMRI data can be analysed using several methods and the possibility to derive various RS-fMRI connectivity measures has also been reported . In this study, the RS-fMRI measures such as regional homogeneity (ReHo) , degree centrality (DC)  and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF)  are considered for finding association with neuroelectric generators of microstates and RA of mGluR5 and GABA . The chosen RS-fMRI measures are distinct, data driven and do not require prior definition of seed voxels/regions. The ReHo measure considers only neighbouring voxels, thus it depicts short-range functional connectivity. The DC measure considers all voxels, so it is considered a long-range functional connectivity measure. The fALFF measure characterises slow fluctuations of the BOLD signal. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe simultaneous trimodal data acquisition was successfully completed in 29 subjects. The PET data were reconstructed and parametric images representing BP  and SUV were calculated as described in the “Methods” section. The calculated PET measures are shown in Fig.  . The artefacts in the EEG data were removed and the microstates were calculated. The three-dimensional (3D) cortical current density distribution for each microstate was calculated using the sLORETA method. The calculated microstates of an exemplary subject and the constructed 3D brain network masks for each microstate are shown in Fig.  . Similarly, after pre-processing of the fMRI data, the RS-fMRI measures (ReHo, DC and fALFF) were calculated for each subject as described in the “Methods” section. The calculated RS-fMRI measures averaged across all the 29 subjects are shown in Fig.  .

In this study, we examined the neurobiological correlates involved in E/I-B within resting-state fMRI networks using simultaneously recorded PET–MR–EEG trimodal imaging data. This unique technology enabled elucidation of the coupling between neuronal activities, energy consumption, neuronal generators of EEG microstates and the availability of the mGluR5 and the GABA  neuroreceptors—fundamental for excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of measuring trimodal data simultaneously using different radioligands and illustrates at the same time a new approach to studying associations between neuronal activities through various measures derived from combined trimodal data. For the first time, insight into the neurobiological foundation of the E/I-B (given as the quantification of the availability of the excitatory and inhibitory receptors as well as the glucose metabolism intensity) has been gained alongside the functional connectivity measures and EEG microstates during the RS. \n\n### EEG microstates \n  \nThe brain network maps of microstates shown in Fig.   demonstrate the location of neuronal generators of each microstate, with all microstates showing the highest current density distribution in the posterior and anterior cingulate cortex. Additional neuronal generator distributions were seen in the precuneus, precentral and postcentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and paracingulate gyrus, comparable with the previously reported results . In addition the spatially overlapping regions are seen in the brain network masks of all microstates as reported previously . A one to one comparison of microstate results presented here against published similar results  cannot be made due to the differences in the EEG data. Custo and colleagues recorded the EEG data in a shielded room with 256 high-density electrodes while in the present study EEG was recorded in MR environment using 32 or 64 channel EEG electrodes. Even though artefact corrections were made, a 100% accurate removal of residual artefacts due to gradient, cardioballistic and movement cannot be made with the existing state of the art techniques. Also, the voxel size of the inverse solution space of standard LORETA method used in this study is 5 mm  which contributed to the spatial overlap of microstate-based brain networks. Notwithstanding to these limitations, the averaged microstates-based brain network maps represent a fragmented version of the fMRI RSNs (Fig.  ) as already reported . In the identified microstates-based brain network masks, the RSN regions were restricted to the cortical areas only usually identified via fMRI or PET. In line with previous observations , the source-localised microstates show the major fMRI-RSN regions, observed by means of fMRI or PET imaging, to be a low-pass-filtered version of the microstate dynamics. \n\n\n### GABA  and mGluR5 RA and their associations with EEG microstates \n  \nThe results depicted in Fig. , show the averaged BP  images of FMZ and ABP, corresponding to the distribution of neuroreceptor availability of GABA  and mGluR5, respectively. These corroborate the notion that GABA  receptors are widely distributed throughout the human brain , whereas mGluR5 receptors are mostly distributed in the anterior cingulate cortex, the medial temporal lobe, the putamen and the caudate nucleus . \n\nIn addition, the results of this study show a significantly higher RA of GABA  in the DMN and SN compared to whole-brain GM as well as in all of the core RSNs compared to the non-core RSNs (SMN) (Fig.  C). Thus, even though GABA  is widely distributed in the brain, the significantly higher RA in the RSNs suggests greater inhibitory action, particularly during resting conditions. \n\nWith respect to the RA of mGluR5, while it was not found to be higher in any of the core RSNs compared to whole-brain GM (Fig.  B), it was found to be significantly higher in the two core RSNs DMN and SN compared to the SMN (Fig.  B). Thus, the higher RA of both GABA  and mGluR5 receptors in the core RSNs compared to SMN during RS indicates that these networks, in particular, require a stable equilibrium between excitation and inhibitory processes compared to the SMN. \n\nOur results pertaining to the link between the cortical neuronal generators of EEG microstates with the RA of GABA  receptors show comparatively higher correlation values than with the FDG-PET SUV and with the RA of mGluR5 receptors (Fig.  ). This is in support of other EEG studies which have shown the involvement of GABA  receptors in the beta oscillations (13–28 Hz) . Furthermore, studies using MRS have also demonstrated an association between GABA concentration and EEG signals in the beta band in the sensorimotor cortex , auditory gating in schizophrenia , and in the working memory load processing capacity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . As microstates represent a fragmented low-pass-filtered version of the RSNs and considering that GABA  receptors mainly mediate synaptic inhibition, our results confirm, from a different perspective, the importance of the inhibitory processes mediated by GABA  receptors in the RSNs during rest. \n\nDespite the higher RA of mGluR5 seen in the RSNs (Fig.  B), the neuronal generators of EEG microstates did not show substantial correlation with the RA of mGluR5 (Fig.  ). mGluR5 receptors are reported to regulate various mechanisms implicated in neurogenesis and synaptic maintenance  as well as in long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) . Further, the mGluR5 receptors share a structural and functional link with the NMDA-R and jointly modulate glutamatergic signalling . In studies combining EEG and PET measures, an association between the mGluR5 RA and EEG delta activity could be demonstrated . Keeping in mind the proven association between the glutamate concentration and EEG oscillations in the gamma band , the negligible association between mGluR5 receptors and the neuronal generators of EEG microstates accessed in the low-frequency range in our study indicate that the excitation of neurons during RS is likely mediated by other glutamate receptors in the 2–20 Hz frequency range. \n\n\n### Glucose metabolism and its association with the availability of mGlu5 and GABA  receptors \n  \nGlucose is the main energy substrate of the adult brain. Although the brain represents only 2% of the body mass, it requires about 20% of the oxygen and 25% of the glucose consumed by the human body . Thereby, the basal metabolism (required for vital functions of neurons) accounts for 30% of the energy consumed by the brain with the remaining 70% being accounted for by spontaneous activity . \n\nIn our study, we replicate a significantly higher FDG uptake (corresponding to a higher glucose metabolism) in the core RSNs—DMN and the SN—compared to the SMN and the whole-brain GM regions in the RS, as already previously shown in other studies . Previous investigations have also demonstrated that, relative to this very high rate of ongoing energy consumption in the RS, the additional energy consumption associated with changes in brain activity is remarkably small, often <5% of the baseline level of activity . Our results indicate that the main proportion of the energy consumption during the RS is directed to the highly active DMN and SN. A task-related deactivation of the DMN  may be permissive for an energy redirection to other task-related networks. The high-energy demand of the SN during rest may be associated with the continuous state of readiness required within the scope of its responsibility for detecting and filtering information necessary to maintain goal-directed behaviour by shifting attention between external and internal processes . \n\nRegarding the question relating to the associations between the glucose metabolism measured via FDG-SUV and the RA of the mGluR5 and GABA , strong voxel-level correlations were observed with both neuroreceptor types in all examined core RSNs, as well as in the whole-brain GM (Fig.  ). \n\nThese results correspond with the established knowledge that glutamate cycling consumes a large proportion of the total energy utilised by the brain , and that 60–80% of the total energy consumption in the brain during RS is devoted to glutamate cycling . Glutamate is the principal neurotransmitter responsible for the majority of excitatory synaptic activity. However, it exhibits very complex signalling and functional diversity, which is decoded by several different receptor types assigned to the ionotropic (iGluR) and the metabotropic glutamate receptor family (mGluR). In this case, mGluR5 belongs to the group I mGluRs family and is usually localised postsynaptically. In contrast with group II and group III mGluRs, which are often localised on presynaptic terminals or preterminal axons where they inhibit neurotransmitter release, activation of group I mGluRs often leads to cell depolarisation and increases in neuronal excitability . Thus, mGluR5 receptor may be considered as a suitable representative of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission and is tightly coupled with glucose metabolism. \n\nWe further observed a strong correlation between the GABA  receptors, which are widely distributed in the cerebral cortex, and the FDG-PET SUV in the core RSNs and whole-brain GM (Fig.  ). GABA  receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels mainly composed of two α, two β and a single γ subunit, which are selected from a diverse pool of 19 different subunit types  and are responsible for most fast synaptic inhibition in the mammalian brain. They also play a crucial role at extra-synaptic sites by mediating tonic inhibition in the brain . The tight association between the glucose homoeostasis and the GABAergic neurotransmission has been demonstrated in some previous PET studies . Here we confirm these findings by demonstrating a tight interrelation between the GABA  RA and glucose metabolism, measured directly, in vivo. \n\nFinally, high correlation values were found between mGluR5 and GABA  in all core RSNs as well as in the remaining GM (Fig.  ). Considering that these are the two most important representatives of the receptors required for excitatory and inhibitory processes in the brain, our results indicate a neurobiological basis of the E/I-B by the means of the innovative trimodal approach. \n\n\n### Glucose metabolism and its association with EEG microstates \n  \nSeveral previous studies have demonstrated tight associations between glucose concentration and metabolic rate and EEG signal changes . A direct association between the glucose metabolism and the neuronal generators of EEG-microstates has, to the best of our knowledge, not been investigated before now. In our study, rather surprisingly, no association was observed between the FDG-SUV and the neuronal generators of the four EEG-microstates (Supplementary Table  ). Given that the synaptic currents responsible for neuronal firing (recorded via EEG during RS) display a high-energy demand, mainly provided by glucose, a stronger correlation was expected between the cortical generators of EEG microstates and the glucose consumption indicated by the SUV of FDG. One possible explanation for the rather weak correlation values revealed here may be due to the different observational periods: the FDG-PET SUV values are showing the FDG uptake averaged over about 6 min while the microstates lasted only a few milliseconds. \n\n\n### Associations of the fMRI measures with glucose metabolism and mGluR5 and GABA  RA \n  \nThe fMRI techniques utilise the BOLD contrast to map the brain’s functional integration. The fMRI signal in the DMN is influenced by the energy demands associated with synaptic currents and action potential propagation . In the absence of external stimuli, the RS-fMRI signal partially represents the metabolic processes but also fluctuations of spontaneous neuronal activity . Thus, examining the relationship between the SUV using FDG-PET and fMRI measures will likely facilitate an accurate interpretation of the BOLD signals. \n\nIn this study, the RS-fMRI measures (DC, ReHo, and fALFF) showed a significant voxel-level correlation with FDG-PET SUV measures in whole-brain GM (Fig.  A), which is in agreement with previously reported results . This indicates a high interrelation between metabolic processes and spontaneous neuronal activity—the high-energy demand of the brain seems to be utilised for high functional connectivity (as revealed in DC and ReHo) as well as for the BOLD fluctuations (as revealed by fALFF). \n\nHowever, the correlation between the fMRI measures and the SUV from FDG-PET is weaker in the core RSNs compared to GM (Fig.  B–D). This may be explained due to the high-energy efficiency of the RSNs , which, despite having more functional connections, possibly use less energy. Further, our results indicate a stronger association of FDG-PET SUV with ReHo than with DC in the DMN (Fig.  B). This may be on account of the more short-range, energy-consuming connections (ReHo) within the DMN or a higher energy-efficiency of the longer-range connections (DC). Such difference was not observed within the SN and the ECN, where within both networks the correlation of the FDG-PET SUV values with ReHo and DC was similarly strong. This points towards a unique property of the DMN relating to energetic efficiency. \n\nTo date, the association between the fMRI measures and the glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission has primarily been investigated using the single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technique. In task conditions, depending on the brain regions and cognitive processes involved, GABA levels have shown both positive and negative correlations with the BOLD signal Arrubla et al.  have found GABA concentration in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to be inversely correlated with connectivity within the DMN during RS . Furthermore, both resting-state and task-based fMRI studies  have also shown associations with glutamate concentration levels. However, the drawback of single-voxel MRS is that the neurotransmitter’s concentration from a single voxel (typically a 3 cm isotropic cube) is used to investigate connectivity within RSNs or the whole brain. In simultaneous MR-PET imaging, this drawback is surmounted by calculating three-dimensional parametric images of the whole brain (about 3 mm resolution), which enables region-of-interest (ROI) analysis. \n\nOur results show disparate association patterns between the fMRI measurements and the GABA  and mGluR5 RA for the three core RSNs and GM, as depicted in Fig.  . \n\nRegarding the associations between the long-range connectivity measure (DC) and the excitatory and inhibitory RA (mGluR5 and GABA ), the most prominent difference was observed in the DMN. Here we found an almost fourfold higher association with the GABA  RA than with the mGluR5 RA. A similarly directed, albeit lower relation, was also observed for the parameters ReHo and fALFF, indicating a predominant role of the inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission within the E/I-B in the DMN. \n\nInterestingly, a higher association between the short-range measure ReHo and the mGluR5 RA was only observed in the SN. The SN is considered to be a filtration and amplification network that is responsible for evaluating specific external/internal stimuli and assigning the relevance of stimuli for goal-directed behaviour . In this specific operating range, the SN may request a higher capacity of excitatory (compared to the inhibitory) receptors and connections than within other RS networks. \n\n\n### Summary \n  \nIn summary, the results presented above contribute to a better understanding of the questions initially raised in the “Introduction” section and reveal the following pertinent conclusions:   \nThe main, relatively high, significant correlations of all four EEG microstates were observed with the RA of GABA  receptors, followed by considerably lower correlations with the FDG-PET SUV and correlations with the RA of mGluR5 receptors to a very low extent. Considering that microstates represent a fragmented low-pass-filtered version of the RSNs, these results confirm the importance of the inhibitory processes mediated by GABA  receptors in the electrophysiological activity of the RSNs during RSs. The negligible association between mGluR5 receptors and the neuronal generators of EEG microstates accessed in the low-frequency range indicate that the excitatory contribution in the E/I-B may be mediated by other glutamate receptors than mGluR5. \n  \nA significantly higher distribution of GABA  and mGluR5 receptors was observed in both the DMN as well as in the SN compared to the non-core RSNs (SMN). However, compared to the whole GM, only the RA of GABA  was significantly higher in these networks. This finding once again supports a leading role of the inhibitory processes during the RS. Furthermore, the RA of mGluR5 and GABA  correlated significantly with each other in all core RSNs and in the remaining GM, indicating the general importance of E/I-B during the RS. \n  \nThe RA of the mGluR5 and GABA  receptors both showed strong voxel-level correlations with the glucose metabolism measured via FDG-SUV in all examined core RSNs as well as in the whole-brain GM. This finding indicates that the high-energy demand during the RS may be mainly directed to the maintenance of the E/I-B. \n  \nEach of the observed core RSNs and GM showed specific association patterns between the different fMRI measure’s and the GABA  and mGluR5 RA. Thus, the relative proportion of excitatory and inhibitory processes within the E/I-B seems to differ between the single RSNs and is most likely to be dependent on their main functions. \n  \n\n\n### Limitations and outlook \n  \nSeveral methodological limitations should be kept in mind when interpreting our results. One of the main limitations of the study is the relatively small sample size, a fact hampering a broader generalisation of our findings. Due to the complex and high-cost procedures involved in the simultaneous trimodal measurements and invasive nature of PET imaging, recruiting a larger sample size is a major challenge. Furthermore, the investigation combines data from three separate studies, each using just one PET tracer in a separate subject group. However, conducting all three examinations in the same group is not conceivable due to the complexity of the trimodal data acquisition paradigms as well as due to the ethical and legal implications relating to the repeated radiation exposure from PET imaging. \n\nRA was only examined in mGluR5 and GABA  receptors, which represent a small fraction of the excitatory and inhibitory neuroreceptors. Investigating all neuroreceptors, or at least the most prominent ones, would have helped to delineate the mechanisms behind the neurovascular and neuroelectric signals in greater detail. Nevertheless, the two chosen receptor types appear to be the most representative of the receptors required for excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. \n\nFurther, the radioligands used for the quantification of the mGluR5 and GABA  RA differ in their receptor binding properties (for ABP: dissociation constant (  K  ) = 1.7 ± 0.2 nmol/L ; for FMZ   K   = 0.7 ± 0.26 nM ). \n\nThese limitations notwithstanding, the results presented here give new insight into the neurobiological foundation of the E/I-B (given as the quantification of the availability of the excitatory and inhibitory receptors as well as the glucose metabolism intensity) in terms of functional connectivity measures and EEG microstates during the RS. Further research involving healthy individuals as well as patients with mental illness will likely shed valuable light towards a better understanding of the neurobiological alterations underlying specific diseases. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe trimodal data presented in this study were acquired using three different PET—radiotracers: ABP, FMZ and FDG. For readability, the datasets are hereafter referred to as ABP, FMZ and FDG data, based on the radiotracer used in the study. \n\n### Trimodal data acquisition \n  \nThe simultaneous trimodal data were acquired using a 3 T hybrid MR-BrainPET scanner system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany)  equipped with an MR-compatible EEG system (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). As shown in a previous study, the EEG electrodes used in this system do not cause any noticeable effect on PET images . The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of RWTH Aachen University and the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (  Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz  ). All methods were performed according to the relevant guidelines and regulations. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and prior written consent was obtained from all volunteers. Moreover, the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection has imposed a 10-year restriction on the injection of PET tracers for the second time in healthy individuals for research purposes. To reduce the implications of this limitation, we included very well-matched groups in the three separate investigations. \n\nOnly the trimodal FDG data presented in this study were taken from a previously published work . Only subjects (or their first degree relatives) with no history of neuropsychiatric disorders as assessed via Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview (MINI)  were included in each study. In addition, only male subjects were included due to the effects of the menstrual cycle on variations in neurotransmitter levels . The data and results presented in this manuscript will be available upon request via the corresponding author. \n\nThe data acquisition protocol for each modality is described below. \n\n#### PET data acquisition \n  \nRadiosynthesis of APB and FMZ were performed according to literature . The PET radioligand was injected as bolus in the FDG study and as bolus plus infusion in the ABP and FMZ studies. The radiotracer was injected via an intravenous (IV) line while the subject was lying in the 3 T hybrid MR–BrainPET scanner. Details relating to the number of subjects, age, and injected activity with   K  , for each study are given in Table  . PET data acquisition in list mode started immediately following injection of the tracer. In ABP and FMZ studies, the eyes closed RS-fMRI and EEG data were simultaneously recorded from the time the radiotracer reached equilibrium in the brain. In the FDG study where no equilibrium is reached, the RS data were recorded exactly from 50 min after radiotracer injection in all subjects. During RS data acquisition, subjects were instructed to close their eyes and not to fall asleep. The simultaneous acquisition of RS data lasted for ~6 min.   \nSubject and injected activity details for each study. \n  \n\nThe PET data were iteratively reconstructed (3D OP-OSEM, 32 iterations and 2 subsets) into 2-min frames. Attenuation correction was performed based on an MR-based and template-based procedure . In addition, the PET data reconstruction incorporated corrections for random and scattered coincidences, dead time, radioactive decay, and pile up. The reconstructed image frames comprised 256 × 256 pixels and 153 slices (voxel size 1.25 mm , isotropic). \n\n\n#### MR data acquisition \n  \nIn all investigations, the anatomical and RS-fMRI images were acquired using magnetisation-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) and T2*-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences, respectively. The anatomical images were acquired before the RS data acquisition during the same session. The MR-imaging parameters considered in each sequence are given below:   \n MP-RAGE sequence  : repetition time (TR) = 2250 ms, echo time (TE) = 3.03 ms, field-of-view (FOV) 256 × 256 × 176 mm , voxel size = 1 × 1× 1 mm , flip angle (FA) = 9°, 176 sagittal slices and a GRAPPA acceleration factor of 2 with 70 auto-calibration signal lines. \n  \n EPI sequence (for FDG and FMZ studies)  : TR = 2200 ms, TE = 30 ms, FOV = 200 × 200 × 108 mm , voxel size = 3.125 × 3.125 × 3.0 mm , FA = 80°, number of slices = 36, number of volumes = 169. \n  \n EPI sequence (for ABP study)  : TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, FOV = 192 × 192 × 108 mm , voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3.0 mm , FA = 80°, number of slices = 33, number of volumes = 180. \n  \n\n\n#### EEG data acquisition \n  \nPrior to the trimodal acquisition, the MR-compatible EEG cap (BrainCap MR, EasyCap GmbH, Herrsching, Germany) was placed on the subject’s head and an electrolyte gel (ABRALYT 2000, EASYCAP GmbH, Herrsching, Germany) was applied between the EEG electrodes and the scalp to reduce impedance. The impedance of all recording electrodes was kept below 10 kΩ. A 32-channel EEG cap was used in the FDG study and a 64-channel EEG cap was used in the ABP and FMZ studies. The EEG electrodes were positioned according to the 10–20 system in both caps. The electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were recorded using an additional electrode. The ECG electrode was connected to the distal part of the trapezius muscle. The RS EEG data (eyes closed) and ECG were recorded using the Brain Vision Recorder (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany) while the subject lay in the scanner. The subjects were instructed to stay calm and relaxed and not fall asleep during the RS measurements. The RS EEG data were recorded at a sampling rate of 5 kHz and bandwidth between 0.016 and 250 Hz. The helium pump of the MR system was switched off during trimodal RS data acquisition in order to avoid the effects of vibration on the MR and EEG system as well as on the subjects. \n\n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### PET \n  \nThe PET images were analysed using the PMOD (version 3.5) software package. The reconstructed PET images were corrected for motion using a PET image-based motion correction method . Following motion correction, the PET images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel size of 2.5 mm along all three directions. Only the three PET image frames corresponding to the RS measurement were considered for further analysis. \n\nThe parametric images representing the BP  in each subject were calculated from the reconstructed ABP and FMZ PET data. The three PET image frames were averaged (time weighted). The BP  was calculated as (  C   −   C  )/  C  , where   C   denotes the activity concentration in an area of high neuroreceptor density, and   C   denotes activity concentration in a non-specific-binding region (region with very low receptor density). The cerebellum  and pons  were chosen as   C   regions for ABP and FMZ, respectively. The   C   regions were defined using a three-dimensional maximum probability atlas  on the MNI space co-registered anatomical images (MP-RAGE). \n\nThe parametric images representing the SUV were calculated from FDG-PET data using the averaged PET image frame during RS. The total activity injected (MBq) and the body weight (kg) of the subject were accounted for when calculating the SUV. The final unit of SUV is g/ml. \n\n\n#### fMRI \n  \nThe RS-fMRI measures (ReHo, DC, fALFF) were calculated using MATLAB-based software packages, SPM12 ( ) and DPABI . The pre-processing steps included the removal of the first 10 volumes of the total acquisition , slice-timing correction with respect to the middle slice of the functional image, realignment, and nuisance covariates regression (NCR). The covariates for NCR included head motion parameters , whole-brain white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mean signals, and the constant, linear and quadratic trends in the BOLD signals. Following the pre-processing steps, RS-fMRI measures were calculated in the subject’s native image space. The temporal filtering of BOLD fMRI signals between 0.01 and 0.08 Hz was performed before DC and ReHo calculation. The ReHo measure was calculated using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (KCC)  as the homogeneity measure over 27 neighbouring voxels . The DC measure was calculated with the Pearson correlation threshold of 0.25 (  p   = 0.001). The fALFF measure was calculated within the BOLD low-frequency range between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz. \n\nOf the currently identifiable RSNs, the DMN, the salience network (SN) and the executive control network (ECN)  are considered to be the core neurocognitive RSNs and, as such, form the basis of analysis in this study. Furthermore, for the purposes of RA comparison within the RSNs, the sensory motor network (SMN) (a non-core RSN) is also considered as a control region. \n\n\n#### EEG \n  \nThe EEG data were processed using the MATLAB-based open-source software packages EEGLAB (version 13,  ) , and FieldTrip software package ( )  and analysed in three steps. First, the data pre-processing was performed to remove artefacts, then the microstates were calculated, and in the final step the microstates were source-localised. Following is a detailed explanation of the EEG-processing steps. \n\n##### EEG data pre-processing \n  \nThe recorded EEG data were imported to EEGLAB and downsampled to 2048 Hz. When recorded alongside fMRI, EEG data are heavily contaminated by gradient artefacts (GA) due to the switching of the gradient magnets in the MR system. Here, the GA were corrected using the FASTR tool  implemented in EEGLAB. The data were then downsampled to 1000 Hz, filtered between 2 and 20 Hz using a Hamming windowed sinc finite-impulse response (FIR) filter implemented in the EEGLAB function   eegfiltnew  , and re-referenced to the average reference. Bad channels were identified and removed based on their correlation to neighbouring channels using the EEGLAB function   clean_rawdata  . In order to remove non-stationary artefacts, such as head movement, artefact subspace reconstruction (ASR)  was performed with the recommended parameters . Following ASR, the data were again re-referenced to the average reference. The pulsatile flow of blood due to the pumping action of the heart causes ballistocardiogram (BCG) artefacts in the EEG data. An adaptive optimal basis set algorithm (aOBS) , which accounts for the key shortcomings of the commonly used optimal basis set (OBS) algorithm , was used to detect and remove these artefacts from the EEG signal. An automatic blind source separation algorithm was used to remove ocular artefacts . To remove further residual artefacts, independent component analysis (ICA)  was performed and the multiple artefact rejection algorithm (MARA)  was used to classify and remove artefactual components. Further BCG-related components were identified and removed with the projection onto independent components (PROJIC) algorithm . Additionally, EEG data showing residual artefacts due to motion were marked and removed using   pop_rejcont()   EEGLAB function. Finally, the first 30 s of the RS-EEG data were rejected, as was the case in the fMRI analysis. In order to reduce the computation time, the EEG data were again downsampled to 125 Hz. \n\n\n##### Microstate calculation \n  \nThe microstates in the artefact-corrected EEG data were analysed using the Microstate plugin ( ) implementation in EEGLAB. Here, the global brain activity is represented in the global field power (GFP) of the multichannel EEG data , with the EEG topographies being considered to be stable around the maxima of the GFP (GFP peaks) . Thus, the GFP was first calculated for each subject, and the EEG topographic maps were then plotted for GFP peaks. All EEG topographic maps marked as GFP peaks were extracted and submitted for spatial clustering, which was performed using a modified atomised and agglomerate hierarchical clustering (AAHC) algorithm . The AAHC algorithm was set to identify the four dominant EEG topographic maps for each subject. Finally, the EEG topographic maps identified for each subject were also sorted into microstates A–D, using the published template maps . \n\nFollowing the microstate calculation and sorting, the EEG data corresponding to each microstate were epoched separately as EEG-MS A, EEG-MS B, EEG-MS C, and EEG-MS D for every individual subject in each study. The epoched microstates of each class was concatenated to give continuous EEG data of particular microstate. \n\n\n##### Source localisation \n  \nThe EEG data of each microstate were exported to the LORETA-KEY software ( ) to solve the inverse problem (source localisation). In a first step, the EEG electrode positions in the MNI152 template were determined  and a 3D cortical current density distribution from the EEG data epochs was calculated using sLORETA . In order to solve the inverse problem, sLORETA computations were made in the realistic head model  using the Montreal Neurological Institute template (MNI152) . The 3D solution space in sLORETA was restricted to the cortical GM. The inverse solutions showing the cortical current density was averaged for each microstate, resulting in a 3D cortical current density distribution for each microstate from every subject. \n\n\n\n#### Intermodality comparison \n  \nIn order to perform intermodality comparisons, the calculated measures from PET, fMRI and EEG MS A–D were co-registered to the MNI152 (2 × 2 × 2 mm ) standard space. Additionally, the co-registered images were linearly standardised into   Z  -values  for each subject.   Z  -value standardisation was calculated by subtracting the mean whole-brain voxel value from each voxel and then dividing the difference by the standard deviation of the whole brain. The   Z  -value standardised measures were then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel size of 3 mm along all three directions. \n\n\n#### RSNs definition \n  \nMasks of the RSNs were obtained from an atlas of 90 functional regions of interest (fROIs) . In order to further restrict the analysis to the GM regions, only the voxels within the GM region of the RSNs (which show more than 50% probability of being GM) were considered (GM correction). A GM tissue- segmented MNI152 (2 × 2 × 2 mm ) template (GM mask) was used for GM correction. A whole-brain GM mask was created by considering only the voxels that showed more than 50% probability of being GM from the tissue-segmented MNI152 template (Supplementary. Fig.  ). Given that different subjects were used in each study (FDG, FMZ and ABP), a subject-level comparison of PET values within each calculated PET measure is not possible. Thus, all the SUV and BPND images were averaged, yielding an averaged PET measure image. Similarly, for fMRI measures, and in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, averaged fMRI measure images were calculated for DC, ReHo and fALFF for each study. Subsequently, all voxel values within the GM-corrected RSNs and GM masks were extracted from the previously calculated subject-level PET, averaged PET and averaged fMRI measures. \n\nSince the 3D solution space in sLORETA was restricted to only the cortical GM, a separate mask for each microstate (MS mask) was created considering only the voxels in the 3D solution space. The brain networks of each microstate were identified using topographic electrophysiological state source-imaging (TESS) method . For this purpose the artefact-corrected continuous EEG data was source localised as mentioned above and the time course of each microstate (microstate dynamics) was estimated. The microstate time course along with the GFP was considered as regressors and fitted to the each of the voxel time series of EEG inverse solution using general linear modelling (GLM) to identify the location of neural sources active during each microstate . The preprocessing steps and TESS method to identify microstate networks are shown in Supplementary Fig.  . The   p  -values of the estimated beta values for each microstate regressors were corrected for false discovery rate at the significance level of 0.01 using Benjamini and Hochberg procedure . Only the significant beta values of each microstate in every subject was transformed to   Z  -score and co-registered to the MNI152 (2 × 2 × 2 mm ) standard space. The mask of individual microstate network was identified by considering only the   Z  -score transformed voxels which are more than zero in at least 50% of the subjects. This resulted in a group mask of each microstate network. The 3D cortical current density distribution of each microstate across subjects were averaged individually for each study. Finally, all voxel values within the MS masks were extracted from the previously averaged PET measures and 3D cortical current density distribution of each EEG microstates. \n\n\n#### Statistics \n  \nAll statistical analyses were performed using the MATLAB (Release 2017, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, United States) software package. The mean values of SUV and BP  were calculated from each subject’s PET image (FDG, FMZ and ABP) for all of the considered regions (GM, DMN, SN, ECN, SMN and MS masks). In order to compare the differences in each PET measure within the considered regions, a stepdown Dunn’s test for non-parametric multiple comparisons  was performed with a significance level of 5%. Dunn’s test was performed using a MATLAB implementation . A one-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was conducted to verify the normality of the extracted voxel values from the averaged PET, fMRI and EEG measures. To determine the association between the SUV of the FDG-PET and the RA of mGluR5 and GABA , Pearson linear correlation coefficients (  r  ) were computed with a significance level of 1% using all voxel values extracted from the averaged PET measures in GM and the core RSNs. Further, in order to elucidate the relationship between the PET measures and RS-fMRI and source-localised microstates, Pearson linear correlation coefficients (  r  ) were computed with a significance level of 1% using averaged measures from each study. In all of the Pearson correlation analyses, the family-wise error rate (FWER), due to multiple comparisons, was controlled for using a permutation test . 10  Permutations were performed for each comparison (correlation), and the   p  -value was adjusted using the “max statistics” method . \n\n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"e800446070c337dc4baa8502a667a624"},

Excited symptoms are the core symptoms of SZ, which appear in the early stage, followed by other stages of the disease subsequently. These symptoms are destructive and more prone to violent attacks, posing a serious economic burden to the society. Abnormal spontaneous activity in the orbitofrontal cortex had been reported to be associated with excited symptoms in patients with SZ. However, whether the abnormality appears in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ has still remained elusive. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nA total of 56 first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ and 27 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). First, differences in fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) between first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ and healthy controls were examined to identify cerebral regions exhibiting abnormal local spontaneous activity. Based on the fALFF results, the resting-state functional connectivity analysis was performed to determine changes in cerebral regions exhibiting abnormal local spontaneous activity. Finally, the correlation between abnormal functional connectivity and exciting symptoms was analyzed. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared with the healthy controls, first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ showed a significant decrease in intrinsic activity in the bilateral precentral gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, and the left orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ had significantly reduced functional connectivity values between the left orbitofrontal cortex and several cerebral regions, which were mainly distributed in the bilateral postcentral gyrus, the right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral paracentral lobules, the left precentral gyrus, and the right median cingulate. Further analyses showed that the functional connectivity between the left orbitofrontal cortex and the left postcentral gyrus, as well as bilateral paracentral lobules, was negatively correlated with excited symptoms in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur results indicated the important role of the left orbitofrontal cortex in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ and suggested that the abnormal spontaneous activity of the orbitofrontal cortex may be valuable to predict the occurrence of excited symptoms. These results may provide a new direction to explore the excited symptoms of SZ. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSchizophrenia (SZ) is one of the most serious and disabling mental diseases ( ). However, due to the complexity of brain structure and functional activities, the etiology of SZ has not been fully clarified yet. Researchers have put forward a series of hypotheses, demonstrating that abnormal cerebral blood flow and neurobiochemical activities may lead to clinical symptoms ( – ). A large number of studies have pointed out that compared with healthy individuals, SZ patients are at a significantly increased risk of excited symptoms (including excitement, hostility, uncooperativeness, and impulsivity) by 2.1–4.6 times ( ,  ). The sudden events, such as destroyed items and violent assaults, are mainly associated with excited symptoms in patients with SZ, which have posed a great burden to society ( – ). Patients with excited symptoms may experience substance abuse, which may prolong the treatment cycle and deteriorate clinical treatment results ( – ). Nevertheless, few clinical studies have yet concentrated on excited symptoms in patients with SZ. \n\nHostility is the expression of anger or resentment toward others in terms of words or actions ( ). Impulsivity is an obstacle to the regulation and control of internal impulse response when integrating internal and external stimuli ( – ), which may lead to reckless emotional catharsis and violence ( ,  ). Patients with SZ lack the ability to timely deal with negative emotions. That is to say, they are highly sensitive to negative emotions and prone to negative urgency ( ,  ). In SZ patients with delusions and hallucinations, sudden impulsive behavior in the face of stress or other extreme events is caused by uncontrolled internal regulation of emotional responses, as well as imbalance in external motor inhibition ( ,  ). Such impulsive behaviors, which not accompany by poor prognostic outcomes, but also increase the burden of disease, are highly prevalent in patients with first-episode and chronic SZ ( – ). Hostility and impulsivity are the most problematic symptoms in patients with SZ ( ). The study of impulsivity and hostility in patients with excited symptoms may provide new ideas for understanding the neuropathological mechanisms of SZ ( ). \n\nHostility and impulsivity are closely associated with dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, especially the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) ( ). Studies have shown that impulsive, hostile, and antisocial behaviors are perpetrated by healthy individuals after OFC damage ( ). OFC serves as a central region of emotional integration and inhibitory control ( ). Alterations in this cerebral region have been demonstrated to be strongly associated with impulsive behaviors in patients with psychiatric disorders ( ,  ). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggested that patients with SZ who were more impulsive showed larger gray and white matter volumes, as well as a smaller cortical thickness in the OFC area compared with those with no history of impulsivity ( ,  ). Functional MRI studies revealed that patients with impulsivity showed anomalous functional connections between the OFC and anterior cingulate gyrus ( ,  ). In addition, several MRI studies demonstrated that the reduced gray matter volume in OFC is negatively correlated with the severity of emotional instability, and an abnormal OFC function has also been shown to be associated with the expressions of negative emotions, such as anxiety and fear in patients with SZ ( ,  ,  ,  ). OFC regulates negative emotions by receiving and transmitting relevant emotional information. After functional impairment, it shows emotional vulnerability and irritability ( ,  ,  ,  ). Given that the OFC is a central element in the emotional and behavioral response network and plays a central role in both emotional regulation and motor inhibition ( ), it is hypothesized that the dysfunction of the OFC is the basis of the manifestation of excited symptoms in patients with SZ. \n\nOFC neurons are common targets for classic and glutamatergic antipsychotic drugs ( ). After drug therapy for patients with chronic SZ, the functional activity of OFC increases significantly, and its association with excited symptoms may be affected ( ). Previous studies could not well exclude the above-mentioned confounding factors ( ). Therefore, after removing the effects of the course of the disease, the long-term use of antipsychotics, and progressive cerebral atrophy on OFC function, exploring the damage to OFC function in patients with first-episode SZ may assist clinicians in the early identification or remission of excited symptoms. \n\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is emerging as a valuable biomarker for measuring connectivity of the brain in patients with neural disorders. It can non-invasively measure internal neural activity with a great stability. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is the most commonly used index to measure the intensity of regional spontaneous cerebral activities ( ,  ). However, when capturing the relative amplitude of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuation in gray matter, a higher frequency range (> 0.08 Hz) of ALFF is sensitive to the interference of physiological factors, such as heartbeat, respiration, etc. ( ,  ,  ). The fractional ALFF (fALFF) method provides a relative estimate of the BOLD signal intensity in the relevant frequency band (0.01–0.08 Hz) ( ,  ). After significantly lessening non-specific signal components, the fALFF improved the sensitivity and specificity in detecting spontaneous cerebral activities ( ,  ). As another frequently used index, resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) analysis describes the functional correlation among spatially unconnected cerebral regions ( ,  ). Preliminary studies of SZ have reported abnormal fALFF in complex cerebral regions. The fALFF-based resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analytical strategy has been scarcely utilized to examine the functional interactions of cerebral regions that showed an altered fALFF in drug-naïve patients with SZ. \n\nThe present cross-sectional study has mainly concentrated on OFC to explore abnormalities in the spontaneous cerebral activity of first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ. A great number of patients with the first onset of SZ who received few medical treatments, as well as age-, gender-, educational level-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. All subjects underwent fMRI scan and positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Firstly, we attempted to determine the abnormal spontaneous cerebral activity in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ, which was measured by fALFF. It was supposed that the neural networks associated with OFC would be vulnerable. Secondly, we considered cerebral regions found in the previous fALFF analysis to compare the functional cerebral activities between first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ and HCs. Finally, to indicate whether the abnormalities found in the fALFF and fALFF-based rsFC analyses would be associated with excited symptoms in patients with SZ, we analyzed the correlation between abnormal indices and scores and sub-scores of excited symptoms. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nThe Ethics Committee of the Nanjing Brain Hospital (Nanjing, China; Approval No. 2013KY010) approved the study protocol. All participants signed the written informed consent form prior to enrollment. \n\n### Subjects \n  \nWe used the previously reported data ( ,  ). First-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ (  n   = 63, 44 men) were recruited from Nanjing Brain Hospital. Patients were diagnosed   via   Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) (SCID-I/P), and met the criteria for SZ. In total, 30 HCs (17 men and 13 women) who were matched in age, educational level, and gender were recruited through advertisements in the local community of Nanjing city. An experienced psychiatrist assessed the current state of mind and personal or family history of any mental disorders. None of the HCs presented a personal or family history of psychiatric disorders. \n\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients who aged 15–45 years old, (2) right-handed patients, and (3) an ability to understand the instructions and contents of the survey. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) a history of head injury, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, neurological diseases (excluding SZ), impaired thyroid function, (2) disability in learning, and (3) meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol or substance abuse or dependence in the past year. \n\n\n### Psychological Assessment of Patients \n  \nTwo trained specialists who had no idea of the content of the research assessed the mental state of patients using the PANSS on the day of the fMRI test. The PANSS originally designed by Kay et al. was used to better evaluate the heterogeneity of symptoms in patients with SZ ( – ). Positive factors, such as delusions, hallucinations, and unusual thought content are mainly considered by clinicians for inclusion of patients. Negative factors (e.g., motivation and social withdrawal, blunted affect, as well as motor retardation) were reported as prognostic factors ( ). General psychopathology is composed of excited factors (mainly involving impulsive behaviors), disorganized/concrete factors (conceptual disorganization, difficulty in abstract thinking, stereotyped thinking, and poor attention), and depressed factors (anxiety, tension, guilt feelings, and depression) ( ). The total score and five-factor scores of PANSS were assessed with SCID-I/P to measure the severity of psychotic symptoms. \n\n\n### Imaging Acquisition \n  \nMRI was performed within 3 days after confirmation of the diagnosis of SZ. The MRI data were collected using the 3.0-T Siemens Verio scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). Besides, foam pads and soft earplugs were used to reduce head motion and scanning noise. Sagittal three-dimensional T1-weighted images were obtained using cerebral volume sequences with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2,000 ms; echo time (TE) = 2.3 ms; reversal time = 900 ms; flip angle (FA) = 7°; field of view (FOV) = 256 mm × 256 mm; matrix size = 256 × 256; slice thickness = 1 mm, gap = 0.5 mm; sagittal section; and acquisition time = 353 s. The gradient echo single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence was used to collect functional BOLD images in the resting-state. The following parameters were considered: TR/TE = 2,000/30 ms; FOV = 240 mm × 240 mm; matrix size = 64 × 64; FA = 90°; slice thickness = 4 mm; no gap; 30 transverse cross-sections; 171 volumes; acquisition time = 346 s. All subjects were asked to lie quietly with their eyes closed, relax, and move as little as possible, without thinking about anything, especially avoiding fall asleep during data collection. \n\n\n### Data Preprocessing \n  \nThere were significant differences in the original data, which could not be analyzed directly, and the fMRI data were preprocessed using the MATLAB 2014a software and Data Processing Assistant for rs-fMRI (DPABI) software ( ,  ). Due to abnormal anatomical scans or visible artifacts in the images caused by excessive head movement, the functional data were deleted. Discarding each participant’s first ten volumes made the machine signal stable and participants were adapted to scanning noise. The remaining volumes were processed for slice timing correction. Then, the computer automatically rearranged images and assessed movement parameters for each participant. The head motion amplitude of each subject was evaluated by the frame-wise displacement (FD). In the present study, FD was set to 0.5 (mean FD ± twice of standard deviation) ( ). Due to the large differences in shape and size of different individuals’ brains, it was difficult to directly make a comparison. Registration and standardization were carried out   via   mapping of different subjects’ brains into a space with the same shape and size so that to make the cerebral anatomical structures of subjects corresponded to each other. The linear trend of covariates was removed and corrected with Friston-24 ( ). We regressed out several nuisance covariates, such as the global brain signal, the white matter signal, and the cerebrospinal fluid signal ( ). DARTEL was used to standardize different brains and to increase the comparability of cerebral functional data among subjects ( ). Finally, 6 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) was used for smoothing to improve the reliability of data. \n\nHowever, 7 first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ and three HCs were excluded due to excessive head movement when MRI scans were performed. \n\n\n### The Fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations Analysis \n  \nVoxel-wise fALFF maps were scanned for each participant using the rs-fMRI machine. ALFF reflects the spontaneous activity of the local cerebral region. The time series of each voxel was first transformed into the frequency domain by the fast Fourier transform. The amplitudes were measured using fALFF within the slow-4 (range, 0.027–0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (range, 0.01–0.027 Hz) bands. FALFF was calculated by the ratio of the root mean square of the power spectrum of low-frequency (range, 0.01–0.08 Hz) to the root mean square of the power spectrum of the whole frequency (range, 0–0.25 Hz) ( ,  ). The fALFF analysis was carried out to reduce the influences of low-frequency drift and high-frequency physiological noise by dividing the total value of full-band amplitude from 0.01 to 0.25 Hz ( ). \n\n\n### The Resting-State Functional Connectivity Analysis Based on Orbitofrontal Cortex Seeds \n  \nThe rsFC was calculated with the Fisher’s transformation of the correlation coefficient using seed-to-voxel analysis ( ). The rsFC analysis was performed on the abnormal region (the left OFC) with global voxels. Connectivity maps were obtained for the left OFC by correlating its average time series with every voxel in the brain. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nGroup-level analyses were carried out to examine cerebral regions with detectable fALFF abnormalities in SZ. The two-sample   t  -test was used to compare fALFF between SZ and HC groups. The fALFF maps were calculated using permutation-based non-parametric inference with 5,000 permutations, with consideration of age, gender, and educational level as covariates of no interest. The statistical threshold was set at voxel level (  p   < 0.001) or cluster level (  p   < 0.05), and the correction was conducted for multiple comparisons by the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) ( ). The rsFC between the region of interest (ROI) and global brain voxels was corrected by the TFCE (with 5,000 permutations; voxel level,   p   < 0.001; cluster level,   p   < 0.05; with consideration of age, gender, and educational level as covariates of no interest) to avoid multiple comparison corrections. The significant fALFF decreased areas in the patients were used as inclusion masks in the following voxel-wise correction analyses, which were carried out to explore the correction between the fALFF map and the severity of symptoms (five components of PANSS). The statistical threshold was also set at voxel level (  p   < 0.001 or cluster level (  p   < 0.05) in the TFCE. Age, gender, educational level, and illness duration were entered into the model as covariates of no interest. Pearson correlation analysis was then used to assess the possible clinical relevance between values of rsFC and the severity of clinical symptoms. PANSS items were converted into five factors. Associations between rsFC and PANSS scores were carried out by Pearson’s correlations, applying Bonferroni correction for the number of correlations (5 subscale scores at   p   = 0.05/5 subscales = 0.01) ( ). When other clinical symptoms are also related to rsFC, it is necessary to controlled significant correlations for the impact of other symptoms. If there was a significant correlation among PANSS excited scores,   post hoc   analysis was employed to explore the correlation among the 2 excited sub-item scores. Although PANSS excited scale contains four groups of clinical symptoms, we only used two dimensions (hostility and impulsivity) for correlation analysis. Associations between rsFC and PANSS excited subscale score were carried out by Pearson’s correlations, also applying Bonferroni correction for 2 comparisons (2 subscale scores at   p   = 0.05/2 = 0.025). \n\nAge, gender, educational level, and illness duration were entered into the models as covariates of no interest. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.00 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, United States). The two-sample   t  -test and the Chi-square test were used for comparing differences in continuous variables and categorical variables between the two groups, respectively.   p   < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Comparison of Demographic Data Between Schizophrenia and Healthy Control Groups \n  \nDemographic characteristics of 83 subjects belonging to SZ and HC groups were compared. The detailed demographic characteristics of subjects in the SZ and HC groups are presented in  . There was no significant difference in gender (Chi-square test, χ    = 0.592,   p   = 0.441), age (two-sample   t  -test,   t   = −1.555,   p   = 0.08), and educational level (two-sample   t  -test,   t   = 1.569,   p   = 0.651) between the two groups. \n  \nDemographic data and clinical information in patients with FES and health controls. \n    \n\n### Comparison of Fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations Values \n  \nIn the current study, the fALFF values in several cerebral regions in the SZ group were lower than those in the HC group (TECE corrected, voxel-level,   p   < 0.001; cluster level,   p   < 0.05). Decreased fALFF values were found in the frontal and occipital lobes, including bilateral precentral gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, right lingual gyrus, bilateral temporal superior gyrus, and left middle occipital gyrus, right calcarine, and left orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) (  and  ). There were no significant differences in fALFF values among the other cerebral regions. \n  \nBrain regions with decreased fALFF values in patients with FES compared with healthy controls (SCZ < HC). \n      \nfALFF maps show differences between the naïve patients with FES and HCs (  p   < 0.05). The patients with FES showed significantly lower values in the bilateral precentral gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, right lingual gyrus, bilateral temporal superior gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, right calcarine, and left orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) relative to both the HC group. Statistically significant differences in fALFF were defined as voxel-level,   p   < 0.001; cluster level,   p   < 0.05, TFCE corrected after correcting for age, gender, and education. T, statistical value of peak voxel showing fALFF values differences between the two groups. The cool color indicated that it decreased in the naïve patients with FES. Reversely, warm color indicated increased values in the naïve patients with FES. \n  \n\n### Comparison of Resting-State Functional Connectivity Values \n  \nFunctional connectivity between the LOFC and each voxel of the global brain was performed to examine network abnormalities in the SZ group. After making correction for multiple comparisons, patients in the SZ group demonstrated significantly reduced rsFC values between the LOFC and several cerebral regions, which were mainly distributed in the bilateral postcentral gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, bilateral paracentral lobule, and right median cingulate compared with HC group (TECE corrected, voxel-level,   p   < 0.001; cluster level,   p   < 0.05) (  and  ). \n  \nCoordinates the peaks of the brain regions with decreased rsFC in naïve schizophrenic patients. \n      \nThe resting-state functional connection was analyzed between the left orbitofrontal cortex and the global brain. With regards to the HC group, left OFC had lower rsFC values in several regions including the left postcentral gyrus, left precuneus, left superior temporal gyrus, and left precentral gyrus with FES (TECE corrected, voxel-level,   p   < 0.001; cluster level,   p   < 0.05). The cool color indicates that rsFC is decreased in the naïve patients with FES. Reversely, warm color indicates rsFC is higher than in the healthy control group. \n  \n\n### Correlations Between the Fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations Values and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Scores \n  \nTo detect possible associations of spontaneous cerebral activity with psychiatric symptoms, the PANSS was used for the assessment of symptoms, which included symptoms in 5 dimensions ( ). These symptoms were correlated with cerebral activation and behavioral activities in patients in the SZ group. It was attempted to elucidate the relationship between the fALFF values and PANSS scores (five dimensions of symptoms) using age, gender, educational level, and illness duration as covariates. However, no voxel has existed after TFCE correction (voxel-level,   p   < 0.001; cluster level,   p   < 0.05). \n\n\n### Correlations Between the Resting-State Functional Connectivity Values and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Scores \n  \nThe relationship between the rsFC values and PANSS scores in patients in the SZ group was assessed ( ,  ). There were several significantly negative correlations between the rsFC values and PANSS excited scores (five dimensions of symptoms) after Bonferroni correction (significant after Bonferroni correction for 5 correlations, all   p   < 0.05/5). After consideration of age, gender, educational level, and illness duration as covariates, these significantly negative correlations could be summarized as follows ( ): (i) the LOFC and the left paracentral lobule (  r   = −0.396,   p   = 0.004,  ), (ii) the LOFC and the right paracentral lobule (  r   = −0.400,   p   = 0.003,  ), (iii) the LOFC and the left postcentral gyrus (  r   = −0.417,   p   = 0.002,  ), (iv) LOFC and the right postcentral gyrus (  r   = −0.354,   p   = 0.01). However, PNASS excited scores did not similarly exhibit a significantly negative correlation with the rsFC values between the LOFC and the right postcentral gyrus, when age, gender, educational level, and illness duration were not included as covariates (  r   = −0.326,   p   = 0.014,  ). \n  \nCorrelations between the rsFC values and PANSS excited scores in patients with FES. \n      \nCorrelations between the rsFC values and PANSS excited scores in patients with FES (taking age, gender, education, and illness duration into covariates). \n      \nNegative correlation between the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) values and the severity of excited symptoms in the FES. The X-axis is the score of the excited factors of the PANSS scale, and the Y-axis shows the functional connectivity of the left orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) and left paracentral lobule (LPL) (after correcting for positive symptoms, age, gender, education, and illness duration). \n    \nNegative correlation between the resting-state functional connection (rsFC) values and the severity of excited symptoms in the FES. The X-axis is the score of the excited factors of the PANSS scale, and the Y-axis shows the functional connectivity of the left orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) and right paracentral lobule (RPL) (after correcting for positive symptoms, age, gender, education, and illness duration). \n    \nNegative correlation between the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) values and the severity of exited scores in the FES. The X-axis is the score of the excited factors of the PANSS scale, and the Y-axis shows the functional connectivity of the left orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) and left postcentral gyrus (after correcting for positive symptoms, age, gender, education, and illness duration). \n  \nThe impact of symptoms other than excited ones on these correlation results was considered. There was a weak negative correlation (  r   = −0.282,   p   = 0.043,  ) between positive symptoms and rsFC (left OFC—left postcentral gyrus). There was no significant correlation between rsFC and negative, cognitive as well as depressed symptoms (all   p   > 0.05). In order to control the impact of positive symptoms on correlation analysis, positive symptoms, age, gender, course of the disease, and years of education were taken as covariates, excited symptoms were still negatively correlated with rsFC. These negative correlations could be summarized as follows ( ): (i) the LOFC and the left paracentral lobule (  r   = −0.327,   p   = 0.019), (ii) the LOFC and the right paracentral lobule (  r   = −0.343,   p   = 0.014), (iii) the LOFC and the left postcentral gyrus (  r   = −0.347,   p   = 0.013). \n\n\n### Correlations Between the Resting-State Functional Connectivity Values and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Subscale Scores \n  \nThe relationship between the rsFC values and PANSS excited subscale scores in patients in the SZ group was assessed ( ,  ). There were several significantly negative correlations between the rsFC values and hostility (two dimensions of symptoms) after Bonferroni correction (significant after Bonferroni correction for 2 correlations, all   p   < 0.05/2). Significantly negative correlations were found between the LOFC and the bilateral paracentral lobule, as well as between the rsFC value of the right median cingulate and hostility symptoms (  r   = −0.369,   p   = 0.007,   r   = −0.328,   p   = 0.018,   r   = −0.459,   p   = 0.001, gender, age, and illness duration were taken as covariates into account,  ). Impulsivity symptoms showed negative correlations with the rsFC value of the right paracentral lobule and left postcentral gyrus (  r   = −0.327,   p   = 0.018,   r   = −0.315,   p   = 0.023, gender, age, and illness duration were taken as covariates into account,  ). \n  \nCorrelations between the rsFC values and PANSS excited subscale scores in patients with FES. \n      \nCorrelations between the rsFC values and PANSS excited subscale scores in patients with FES (after correcting for age, gender, education, and illness duration). \n    \nThere were several significantly negative correlations between the rsFC values and PANSS excited subscale scores (hostility and impulsivity) after consideration of positive symptoms, age, gender, educational level, and illness duration as covariates. These significantly negative correlations of hostility could be summarized as follows ( ): (i) the LOFC and the right paracentral lobule (  r   = −0.332,   p   = 0.017), (ii) the LOFC and the right postcentral gyrus (  r   = −0.321,   p   = 0.022), (iii) the LOFC and the right median cingulate (  r   = −0.428,   p   = 0.002), (iv) the LOFC and the left precentral gyrus (  r   = −0.328,   p   = 0.019), (v) the LOFC and the right precentral gyrus (  r   = −0.318,   p   = 0.023). Impulsivity symptoms showed negative correlations with the rsFC value of the right paracentral lobule and left precentral gyrus (  r   = −0.335,   p   = 0.016,   r   = −0.337,   p   = 0.015,   p   < 0.025,  ). However, hostility did not similarly exhibit a significantly negative correlation with the rsFC values, when positive symptoms, age, gender, educational level, and illness duration were not included as covariate. These not significant negative correlations were summarized as follows ( ): (i) the LOFC and the right postcentral gyrus, (ii) the LOFC and the right precentral gyrus, (iii) the LOFC and the left precentral gyrus. Impulsivity symptoms showed negative correlations with the rsFC value of the right paracentral lobule and left precentral gyrus (  r   = −0.335,   p   = 0.016,   r   = −0.337,   p   = 0.015,   p   < 0.025,  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe, in the present study, utilized rs-fMRI data, including fALFF and fALFF-based rsFC values to measure the resting-state of spontaneous cerebral functions in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ who did not experience antipsychotic medication. The results initially confirmed that compared with HCs, first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ exhibited decreased fALFF values in the LOFC, bilateral precentral gyrus, and bilateral postcentral gyrus. In the second step, the LOFC was taken as a seed into account to explore rsFC values in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ. We found decreased rsFC values between the LOFC and frontal cortex, including bilateral postcentral gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral paracentral lobules, the left precentral gyrus, and the right median cingulate. Finally, several correlation analyses were conducted to indicate whether the functional connectivity in the LOFC could be negatively correlated with excited symptoms, especially impulsive behaviors, and hostility. Considering the influences of potential confounding factors of the course of the disease and drugs, our results may provide a possible direction for exploring the pathogenesis of excited symptoms in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ. \n\nFALFF or ALFF is an index that always measures the spontaneous activity of the cerebral regions, reflecting the levels of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glucose metabolism. The decreased fALFF value in the LOFC in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ was previously reported repeatedly ( ,  ). To our knowledge, OFC is important for the assessment of thoughts and intentions on social communication by information flow integration and feedback ( ,  ,  ). The fALFF value reflects the speed or amount of information flow in OFC. Neuroimaging studies indicated that the density of the LOFC gray matter also decreased in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ ( ,  ,  ). The loss of gray matter volume was reported to be associated with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) dysfunction and dopamine hyperfunction, which activated neurotoxic signal transduction pathways and induced neuronal, and synaptic necrosis ( ). This triggered off the compressing or blocking of the transmitted information in varying degrees, explaining the functional deactivation state of OFC. The same decreased fALFF value in the LOFC was also found in patients with impulsive SZ ( ). The impaired OFC decreased the inhibitory control mechanism through GABAergic neurons, and the change of OFC might lead to the delay of impulse inhibition ( ). Hoptman et al. found the increased fALFF values of OFC in patients with chronic SZ ( ), which was contrary to our results. Further study suggested that antipsychotics could be effective by partially restoring the function of the frontal cortex through synaptic plasticity ( ,  ). The reason for the increase in fALFF value may be that the chronic patients received medication, and the function of OFC was partially recovered and played a super-compensatory role ( ). These findings suggested that the anomalous OFC function in SZ patients may be related to the time of onset. \n\nNumerous studies demonstrated that SZ is a functional connectivity disorder, and our research provided new evidence for this statement ( ,  ). Anatomically, the paracentral lobule is the medial extension of the precentral and postcentral gyri ( ). Precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus, as well as paracentral lobule possess a consistency in segregating and conveying sensorimotor information, and they are the main components of the sensorimotor network (SMN) ( ,  ). Recently, it was suggested that a sufficient information flow in SMN is essential to ensure unbiased emotional and behavioral responses ( ). Several studies have reported the associations of impulsive violence to motor errors and the reduced speed of perceptual information processing in daily life ( ). \n\nThe cingulate cortex is a structure implicated in behavioral adaptation and control. The median cingulate cortex is highly connected to areas involved in action control and decision making, such as OFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, sensorimotor, and motor cortices. The median cingulate cortex has been emphasized to play a role in different facets of cognitive control, including response selection, attentional processing, conflict monitoring, and detecting errors ( ). Our results also confirmed that the functional association between the LOFC and the right median cingulate is sparse in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ. It was demonstrated that the median cingulate cortex harbors a large number of short cortical contact fibers connected to the frontal cortex ( ). The decreased connectivity indicated impaired sensorimotor integration and motor control in the early onset ( ,  ). \n\nTo better evaluate the relationship between excited symptoms and cerebral functional conditions, we further proved that the functional connection between OFC and SMN including bilateral paracentral lobules, as well as median cingulate was negatively correlated with the scores of excited symptoms. The thickness of the gray matter cortex of OFC and paracentral lobule was smaller, which was related to its perceived function in SZ ( ). Anatomical studies demonstrated defects in the cingulate cortex and OFC that were bound up with impulsive behaviors and hostility in psychiatric patients and HCs ( ,  ,  – ). Due to the role of the paracentral lobule in transmitting sensory and motor information to the SMN, an abnormal connectivity could lead to misperceptions and inappropriate behaviors. People could be fully mobilized flexibility through the OFC to adapt emotions to environmental changes, and functional connectivity might lead to disease-related painful experience and expressions of abnormal emotions or behaviors. We analyzed this correlation and clarified the changes in the brain network in the early stage of SZ, and clinical excited symptoms of SZ could be attributed to abnormal OFC-SMN circuits ( ). Reduced functional connectivity between OFC and MCC could lead to an attenuated ability to monitor conflicts and detect errors ( ). Functional deactivation of relevant cerebral regions, reduced information flow, difficulty in synchronizing activity between cerebral regions, decreased connectivity, and other dysfunctions could occur continuously in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ. All these constitute the neuropathological basis of excited symptoms. Psychotic symptoms including excited symptoms could be effectively relieved by adherence to antipsychotic medication during the acute phase of the disease. As the target of 5-OH and DA, OFC had been shown to partially restore its function ( ,  ). However, long-term antipsychotic treatment had not achieved sustained results. The future research will concentrate on performing effective and accurate treatments. \n\nIn the subsequent analysis, we also observed a significantly negative correlation between connectivity strength in OFC and hostility symptoms in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ (  P   < 0.025). Similarly, the correlation between impulsivity and functional connection decreased, while the significance was not comparable to hostility. The possible reason is that abnormal connectivity of the OFC circuit enhanced the reactivity of negative stimuli ( ), and was further considered to increase the tendency of personal hostility and impulsivity ( ). Patients in our study had the first onset of SZ. The spontaneous activity and functional connection of OFC decreased, resulting in mild agitation symptoms, such as hostility. When the course of the disease continued to progress, they further showed impulsive behaviors. Based on the negative correlation, the level of functional connection between OFC and SMN deviated from the normal, representing the severity of excited symptoms. We could make full use of this result to further predict the risk of impulsive behaviors in patients with SZ. Such accurate prediction and control measures may enable us to reduce social and public hazards. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThere are several limitations in the present study. First, the study used a cross-sectional design and could not forecast how cerebral spontaneous activity may change during the clinical course of SZ. Further studies are therefore needed to fully understand the implications of our findings. Second, the sample size of our research was small, although it was comparable to most fMRI studies on first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ, and it is essential to enrich the theoretical basis. Third, we clarified the correlation between LOFC-SMN connection and excitatory symptoms. However, it remained elusive whether the pathophysiology of excitatory symptoms originates from LOFC, SMN, or LOFC-SMN. Last but not least, our research concentrated on excited symptoms, while the severity of the symptoms varied among subjects, and the monotonic function of the measurement tool was noteworthy. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ were found to be associated with the decreased spontaneous cerebral activity in the LOFC. The rsFC values, in association with the LOFC, were significantly correlated with excited symptoms. More importantly, we determined that these coupling strengths could early predict the violent behaviors exhibited by these patients. Our findings might provide some perspectives for the study of hostility and impulsivity in first-episode drug-naïve patients with SZ. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of Nanjing Brain Hospital.

Given the critical role of the default mode network (DMN) in the physiopathology of MDD, the current study aimed to investigate the effects of antidepressants on the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within and between the DMN subsystems. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from 36 unmedicated MDD patients at baseline and after escitalopram treatment for 12 weeks. The rs-fMRI data were also collected from 61 matched healthy controls at the time point with the same interval. Then, we decomposed the DMN into three subsystems based on a template from previous studies and computed the rsFC within and between the three subsystems. Finally, repeated measures analysis of covariance was conducted to identify the main effect of group and time and their interaction effect. We found that the significantly reduced within-subsystem rsFC in the DMN core subsystem in patients with MDD at baseline was increased after escitalopram treatment and became comparable with that in the healthy controls, whereas the reduced within-subsystem rsFC persisted in the DMN dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) and medial temporal subsystems in patients with MDD following escitalopram treatment. In addition, the reduced between-subsystem rsFC between the core and dMPFC subsystem showed a similar trend of change after treatment in patients with MDD. Moreover, our main results were confirmed using the DMN regions from another brain atlas. In the current study, we found different effects of escitalopram on the rsFC of the DMN subsystems. These findings deepened our understanding of the neuronal basis of antidepressants’ effect on brain function in patients with MDD.

Antidepressant therapy (i.e., selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) is the first-line treatment for patients with MDD [ ]. Although it is well-known that most antidepressant medications primarily modulate monoaminergic neurotransmitters (such as serotonin [5-HT]), translation of these neurobiological changes into clinically important events remains unclear [ ]. Neuroimaging studies in the last decades have found abnormal communications among large-scale brain networks, including the default mode network (DMN), frontoparietal network, and other networks related to emotion or salience processing in patients with MDD [ ,  ]. Thus, identifying the effects of antidepressants on the brain networks is important to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms of antidepressant action and develop targets for new interventions. \n\nAmong the brain networks related to MDD, the DMN draws increasing researchers’ attention in MDD studies. Evidence suggests that the DMN is responsible for self-referential processing [ ,  ], and this function is impaired in patients with MDD, such as disordered self-referential thought and maladaptive rumination [ – ]. Using resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), which detects synchronized spontaneous activity across anatomically distinct brain regions [ ], previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have frequently reported abnormal rsFC within the DMN in patients with MDD. The seminal study conducted by Greicius and his colleagues has shown increased rsFC of the subgenual cingulate and thalamus with the DMN in the depressed subjects [ ]. The increased rsFC within the DMN in patients with MDD is supported by a recent meta-analysis study [ ]. However, decreased rsFC within the DMN has also been reported in patients with MDD. For example, based on the dataset consisting of 1300 patients with MDD and 1128 healthy controls (HCs) from 25 sites of China, Yan et al. [ ] found decreased rsFC within the DMN in patients with MDD. \n\nThe DMN may be a vital target of treatment response of antidepressant medications at the neural circuit level because its functionality is modulated by several neurotransmitter systems or their interactions, such as serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid [ – ], which are either neurobiological targets of antidepressant medications or implicated in MDD pathophysiology [ – ]. Among these, the relationship between DMN and serotonin has attracted our attention. First, the expression of several 5-HT receptors spatially overlaps with the main DMN regions [ ]. A study combining positron-emission tomography and fMRI showed that the rsFC of the DMN can be predicted by individual variations in the 5-HT 1A receptor binding in the dorsal raphe nucleus and in the project regions [ ]. Second, pharmacologic neuroimaging studies indicated that the functional connectivity of the DMN is modulated by serotonin levels. For example, depletions of the 5-HT precursor tryptophan can change the rsFC of the DMN [ – ]. SSRIs, which can block the reuptake of 5-HT by inhibiting the 5-HT transporter (SERT), may decrease DMN connectivity [ ,  ]. Furthermore, the modulation of the serotonin system on the DMN is dose-dependent as indicated by the occupancy level of SERT by citalopram (one of the SSRIs) [ ]. All these studies suggest that the DMN is an important network in understanding the underlying mechanism of the antidepressant treatment of MDD, especially SSRIs. Therefore, the current work focused on the DMN and attempted to investigate the effect of SSRIs on the rsFC of the DMN. \n\nNotably, the DMN can be divided into three subsystems [ ], that is, the midline core subsystem, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) subsystem, and medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem. The core subsystem, including the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), participates in the processes of self-related activity regardless of temporal context and links all of the three subsystems [ ]. The dMPFC subsystem, comprising the dMPFC, temporal poles, lateral temporal cortex, and temporoparietal junction, is predominantly involved in meta-cognitive processes and mentalizing [ ]. The MTL subsystem, comprising the hippocampal formation, retrosplenial cortex, and inferior parietal lobule, is associated with recollection of experiences and autobiographical processing [ ]. The subsystems may be differently affected by the antidepressant medications because of their heterogeneity in functions. On the one hand, the modulation role of the 5-HT neurotransmitter system on the rsFC of the DMN is identified in the regions within the core subsystem [ ]. On the other hand, previous fMRI studies have often reported altered local spontaneous neuronal activities and rsFC in the DMN core subsystem in patients with MDD following acute-phase SSRI treatment [ ,  ]. For example, one study has found that escitalopram treatment for 4 weeks induces an increase of local spontaneous brain activity in the MPFC and middle cingulate cortex [ ]. Another study has found that treatment response is associated with decreased rsFC between amygdala and the right precuneus as well as the right PCC after antidepressant treatment (including fluoxetine and sertraline) [ ]. Therefore, the subsystems of the DMN may be affected by antidepressants to a different extent, and the core subsystem is more likely affected by antidepressants in patients with MDD. Based on previous reports, only one study has noted the dissociation effect of antidepressants on the DMN and found that after 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment, rsFC within the posterior component of the DMN was changed to a level similar to that seen in HCs, whereas rsFC within the anterior component persisted in patients with MDD [ ]. However, in this study, the DMN was divided into two subsystems, with the MPFC in the anterior subsystem and the bilateral precuneus in the posterior subsystem. Moreover, in this study, patients were treated with several antidepressant medications, including SSRIs and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which might generate different effects on the brain circuits [ ]. Therefore, it is still unclear on the effect of antidepressant treatment on the rsFC of the DMN subsystems in patients with MDD. \n\nIn the current study, we selected escitalopram, a highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, as the single antidepressant medication and investigated the effect of 12-week antidepressant treatment on the rsFC of the 3 DMN subsystems. We are particularly interested in the rsFC within and between each subsystem of the DMN. Notably, we recruited a group of unmedicated patients with MDD to exclude the confounding effect of previously prescribed medications. The same as our patients matched HCs were also scanned at baseline and after 12 weeks. Such a strategy can exclude confounders of test–retest noise and provide a reliable reference to identify whether brain alterations persist in patients with MDD after treatment with escitalopram [ ]. We hypothesize that the rsFC within or related to the core subsystem might be particularly influenced by the treatment of escitalopram because of its functionality and the modulation effect observed in previous studies. Moreover, we hypothesize that not all of the rsFC within the DMN subsystems or between-subsystems after treatment will be changed to a level similar to that seen in HCs, and some abnormalities in the rsFCs might persist in patients after treatment based on previous studies [ ,  ]. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study was conducted in Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University, an affiliated teaching hospital in Beijing, China. We recruited 40 unmedicated patients with MDD from the outpatient departments. The diagnosis of patients with MDD was made by trained psychiatrists using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 5.0 [ ] based on the DSM-IV criteria at the entry of this study. The inclusion criteria of the patients were as follows: male or female outpatients aged at least 18 years and not more than 65 years; systemic anti-depressants treatment were not adopted during a current episode or has taken anti-depressants less than 7 days in last 14 days; total score of the 16-Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) ≥ 11 [ ] and score of the Chinese version of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) ≥ 14 [ ] at enrollment in open-label preliminary phase; at least primary school education and understand the scales; and preparing to use escitalopram. The exclusion criteria of patients included history of manic episode or hypomanic episode; history of bipolar, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other psychotic disorders; history of drug and alcohol dependence or acute intoxication; women in pregnancy or lactation; significant risk of suicidal behaviors; HAMD-17 Item 3(suicide) score ≥ 3; current clinically significant disease; previously intolerant or lack of response to escitalopram and any MRI contraindications. \n\nHCs (  N   = 64) were recruited by advertisements and were interviewed by using the MINI to exclude any DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis. All healthy participants met the same additional exclusion criteria as the patients with MDD and were matched on age, gender composition and educational level with the patients with MDD. All participants signed informed consent to participate in the current study. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University. \n\n\n### Treatment and measurements \n  \nAll patients with MDD were treated with escitalopram for 12 weeks. Head-to-head studies have confirmed that escitalopram is one of the antidepressants with better efficacy and acceptability than others [ ,  ]. In Asian countries, escitalopram is one of the most frequently prescribed drugs in patients with MDD [ ,  ]. In accordance with the Clinical Practice Guidelines, the dose of escitalopram increased from 5 mg/day to 10–20 mg/day within 7 days, and the dose remained unchanged until the patients completed the 12-week study [ ]. Patients experiencing insomnia symptoms were permitted to receive additional medications as needed. No other medications were permitted to be used during the study. Finally, 13 patients received additional medications, including estazolam for 2 patients, lorazepam for 9 patients, and oxazepam for 2 patients. The HAMD-17 was assessed by trained and experienced independent raters. All patients were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks. All participants also completed the self-reported questionnaire of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [ ]. \n\nSeven participants, including four MDD patients and three HCs, were excluded. Four MDD patients were excluded because of non-adherence to the protocol (  N   = 1) or excessive head movement (  N   = 3, see details in the following section). Three HCs were excluded because of non-adherence to the protocol during the follow-up period. A total of 97 participants were included in the final analysis, of which 36 were MDD patients and 61 were HCs. The demographic characteristics of the participants are shown in Table  .   \nDemographics and clinical characteristics. \n  \nNotes: Values are shown in mean ± SD. Abbreviations:   MDD   major depressive disorder,   HCs   healthy controls,   FD   framewise displacement,   PHQ-9   Patient Health Questionnaire-9,   HAMD-17   17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale,   H   high school,   U   undergraduate,   G   graduate. \n\nAge and HAMD scores were analyzed by using the two-sample   t   test. \n\nGender and education were analyzed by using the chi-square test. \n\nHeadmotion and PHQ-9 were analyzed by using two-way repeated analysis of covariance. \n  \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nAll scans were performed by using a 3.0 T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma MRI scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with a 64-channel phased-array head coil. Foam paddings were used to minimize head movement, and earplugs were used to minimize scanner noise. A total of 200 volumes of functional images were obtained axially with an echo-planar imaging sequence: number of slices = 33, repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, field of view (FOV) = 200 × 200 mm , phase encoding direction = anterior to posterior, in-plane matrix resolution = 64 × 64, slice thickness = 3.5 mm, gap = 0.7 mm and voxel size = 3.13 × 3.13 × 4.2 mm . High-resolution sagittal T1 images were acquired by using the 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence: TR = 2530 ms, TE = 1.85 ms, flip angle = 15°, FOV = 256 × 256 mm , slices number = 192, with a thickness of 1 mm, no gap, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm . Before scanning, participants were instructed to keep awake with their eyes closed, not to think any particular thing, and try their best to keep still without any head motion. The duration of the resting-state fMRI scanning was 6 min and 40 s. The patients with MDD underwent identical MRI scan sequences at baseline and after treatment for 12 weeks. The HCs also experienced two scans with the same interval. \n\n\n### Resting-state fMRI data preprocessing \n  \nData preprocessing steps were performed by using a data processing assistant for resting-state fMRI (DPARSF_V4.5,  ) [ ]. First, we removed the first five-time points to exclude possible magnetization effects. Then, we performed slice timing; realignment; segmentation of T1 structural images to generate gray matter, white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); nuisance covariate regression; normalization to MNI space (voxel size = 2 × 2 × 2 mm ), spatial smoothing with a 4 mm FWHM kernel, and band-pass filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz). The nuisance covariates included linear and quadratic trends, the first five principal components of the individually segmented WM and CSF, and Friston’s 24 motion parameters (six head motion parameters, six head motion parameters one-time point before, and 12 corresponding squared items) [ ,  ]. We did not regress out the global signals in the nuisance covariates regression because doing so may lead to artificial negative correlations in rsFC analysis [ ] and distort between-group effects [ ,  ]. \n\nWe limited our data analyses to participants with a receivable range of head motion to reduce the effect of motion-related artifacts on rsFC. First, we used volume-based Frame-wise Displacement (FD) to quantify micro-head motions [ ], and participants who had less than 100 “good” volumes of data (a threshold of FD ≤ 0.5 mm) were excluded [ ]. Second, participants with severe head motion (above three standard deviations of mean FD beyond the mean value) were excluded. Collectively, we excluded three patients. Moreover, we employed volume-based scrubbing regression by including scrubbing regressors as nuisance covariates [ ], and we used the mean FD as a covariate in group-level analyses. \n\n\n### Definition of regions of interest (ROIs) within the DMN subsystems \n  \nWe used a total of 24 anatomical ROIs created by Yeo et al. [ ] based on their 17-network parcellation, which was derived from data of 1000 young healthy participants [ ,  ]. These 24 ROIs could be divided into three DMN subsystems: nine ROIs in the core subsystem, nine ROIs in the dMPFC subsystem, and six ROIs in the MTL subsystem [ ,  ]. These ROIs are shown in Fig.   and Table  .    Default mode network subsystems.  \nPanel   A   shows spatial distributions of the three subsystems of the default mode network from Yeo’s template [ ,  ]. Brain regions painted in yellow belong to the core subsystem; brain regions painted in blue belong to the dMPFC subsystem, and brain regions painted in red belong to the MTL subsystem. Panels of   B   show the lower triangular of the averaged functional connectivity matrices among 24 ROIs of the default mode network in the healthy controls and the patients with MDD at baseline and after 12 weeks. The color bar represents functional connectivity strength. Panel   C   shows the result of hierarchical clustering analysis for the connectivity matrix of the healthy controls at baseline, which were consistent with Yeo’s default mode subsystems. The meaning of the color of the number is the same as those in Panel A. See Table   for the meaning of numbers. \n  \n\n\n### Functional connectivity analyses \n  \nThe mean time series were extracted from each ROI. Pearson correlation coefficient between the mean time series of each pair of these 24 ROIs was computed, resulting in a 24 × 24 functional connectivity matrix for each participant. Then, Fisher r-to-z transformation was conducted for all rsFC values. On the basis of this normalized connectivity matrix of each participant, we computed the rsFC within and between the subsystems of the DMN [ ,  ]. In particular, two types of network connectivity (within-subsystem and between-subsystem) for the three subsystems were computed on the basis of the connectivity matrices [ ]: the within-subsystem connectivity for each subsystem was calculated as the averaged connectivity across all the links within the subsystem normalized by the square of the number of nodes (ROIs). The pairwise connectivity between subsystems was computed as the averaged connectivity across all the links between two subsystems normalized by the product of the number of nodes within each of the two subsystems. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nA two-sample   t   test, and chi-squared test were used to assess the differences in demographic data between the patients with MDD and the HCs using SPSS version 23.0. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed to validate that these ROIs were grouped into three pre-defined subsystems in the HCs. Then, a two-way repeated-measures analysis of covariance was performed to determine the main effects of group (MDD patients vs. HCs), time (baseline vs. 12 weeks), and the group × time interaction on each within-subsystem rsFC and between-subsystem rsFC, with age, gender, educational level, and head motion (mean FD) as nuisance covariates.   P   values < 0.05 were adjusted for multiple comparisons by controlling the false-discovery rate (FDR). \n\nWe also conducted group-level analyses on the rsFC of each pair of these 24 ROIs to give a comprehensive view of the treatment-related effect on rsFC. We used Network-Based Statistics (NBS) [ ] to identify sub-networks, in which the rsFC was affected by the main effect of group and time and their interaction effect. Based on our research aim, here we only focused on the interaction effect, that is, treatment-related effect. Analogous to cluster-based correction strategies used in voxel-wise fMRI studies, the NBS [ ] focused on the multiple-comparison problem posed by connectomic data by evaluating the null hypothesis at the level of interconnected sub-networks rather than individual connections. To realize this analysis, we used the NBS toolbox ( ) to analyze the functional matrices with statistical threshold:   t  -threshold = 5.5, 5000 permutations, and corrected   P   < 0.05. \n\nWithin-subsystem and between-subsystem rsFC values were extracted in the patient group to explore the relationship between changes of the DMN functional connectivity (rsFC –rsFC ) and the clinical improvement (HAMD –HAMD ). Pearson correlation analysis was conducted between the changes of rsFC values and the clinical improvement. The relationship between the DMN subsystem connectivity (within- and between-subsystem connectivity) at baseline and the clinical improvement was also explored. Owing to the small sample size, an uncorrected statistical significance level of   P   < 0.05 was used. \n\n\n### Confirmation analyses \n  \nWe repeated our analyses by using another functional brain atlas (Power 264 atlas, which included 58 DMN regions) to exclude the influence of potential variability in ROI selection on our results [ ] (for details, see the  ). We intersected the 58 ROIs of DMN in the Power atlas [ ] with Yeo’s DMN template to exclude 11 ROIs, which resulted in 47 ROIs for subsequent analyses. Then, within-subsystem and between-subsystem connectivity for the three subsystems were computed using the same methods for the main analyses. \n\nIn addition, the main analyses were repeated by comparing the responders and non-responders to escitalopram. The responder exhibited a more than 50% reduction in the initial HAMD-17 scores. The main analyses in the responders were also repeated by comparing the DMN subsystem connectivity between the responders and HCs. Finally, the DMN subsystem connectivity in the HCs between the two-time points was compared by paired   t   tests to determine the stability of the main findings. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and clinical characteristics \n  \nThe demographic characteristics of the subjects are shown in Table  . Distributions of age, gender, educational level, and head motion (mean FD) were not significantly different among the patients with MDD and the HCs (all   P  -values > 0.05). The HAMD-17 total scores of the patients were significantly decreased after 12-week treatment (  P   < 0.05). Among the patients, 28 (77.8%) achieved response defined as a reduction of 50% or more in the HAMD-17 score, and 19 patients (52.8%) showed clinical remission with HAMD-17 score ≤ 7. The PHQ-9 total scores of patients with MDD were also significantly decreased after 12-week treatment (  P   < 0.05). Moreover, both of the scores of patients with MDD at baseline and after 12 weeks were significantly higher than those of the HCs (  P  -values < 0.05), in whom no difference in the PHQ-9 total scores was found at baseline and after 12 weeks (  P   > 0.05), and the scores of the HCs were all below 5. \n\n\n### DMN subsystem connectivity within each group \n  \nThe lower triangular of the averaged functional connectivity matrix was displayed for each group (Fig.  ). The hierarchical clustering analysis verified that the DMN ROIs included in our studies were grouped into the predefined subsystems in the HCs, as reported in previous studies [ ,  ] (Fig.  ). The MDD patients showed similar connectivity patterns among the 24 ROIs as the HCs. \n\n\n### Group × time interaction effect on the DMN subsystem connectivity \n  \nA significant interaction effect between group and time was found in the within-subsystem rsFC of the core subsystem (  P   < 0.05, FDR corrected; Fig.  ). Post hoc analysis showed that within-subsystem rsFC values of the core subsystem in the MDD patients at baseline were significantly lower than those of the HCs at baseline (  P   = 0.007, Bonferroni corrected) and significantly lower than those of the MDD patients after treatment (  P   = 0.013, Bonferroni corrected); however, within-subsystem rsFC values of the core subsystem in the MDD patients after treatment were not significantly different from those of the HCs after 12 weeks (  P   > 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) (Fig.  ). In addition, we found a trend toward the significance of the interaction effect on the rsFC between the core and dMPFC subsystem (  P   = 0.055, FDR corrected). Post hoc analysis showed that between-subsystem rsFC values of the core and dMPFC subsystems in the MDD patients at baseline were significantly lower than those of the HCs at baseline (  P   = 0.008, Bonferroni corrected) and significantly lower than those of the MDD patients after treatment (  P   = 0.013, Bonferroni corrected); however, between-subsystem rsFC values of the core and dMPFC subsystems in the MDD patients after treatment were not significantly lower than those of the HCs after 12 weeks (  P   > 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). The rsFC values (z transformed) of within and between-DMN subsystems are shown in Table  .    The interaction effect and main effect on the rsFC within and between the DMN subsystems.  \nPanel   A   summarizes the interaction effect and main effect within and between the DMN subsystems. Panel   B   shows the significant interaction effect on the within-subsystem rsFC of the core subsystem and the between-subsystem rsFC of the core and dMPFC subsystem using violin plots. Panel   C   shows the significant group main effect on the within-subsystem rsFC in the dMPFC and MTL subsystems using violin plots. **  P  -values < 0.01; *  P  -values < 0.05 for post hoc analyses. \n    \nSignificant effects of main and interaction on the rsFC (z transformed) within and between the DMN subsystems. \n  \nNotes:   P   values after FDR correction. *significant after FDR correction (  P   < 0.05). Abbreviations:   MDD   major depressive disorder,   HCs   healthy controls,   dMPFC   dorsal medial prefrontal cortex,   MTL   medial temporal lobe. \n  \n\nFor the rsFC of each pair of ROIs, we found that the group and time interaction effect was significant in 19 connections (  P   < 0.05, NBS corrected; Fig.   and Table  ). Similar to the findings obtained in the subsystem level, the interaction effect involved the connectivity within the core subsystem (7 connections) and between the core and the dMPFC subsystems (10 connections). Post hoc analysis showed that all of these ROI-to-ROI rsFC values in the MDD patients at baseline were significantly lower than those of the HCs at baseline (  P  -values < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) and significantly lower than those of the MDD patients after treatment (  P  -values < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected); however, all of these rsFC values in the MDD patients after treatment were not significantly lower than those of HCs after 12 weeks (  P  -values > 0.05, Bonferroni corrected).

As shown in Fig.  , within-subsystem rsFC values of the dMPFC or the MTL subsystem in the MDD patients were significantly lower than those of the HCs (  P   < 0.05, FDR corrected). No main effect of group was found in other within- or between-subsystem rsFC. In addition, no main effect of time was found. \n\n\n### Correlations between the DMN subsystem connectivity and clinical improvements \n  \nNo significant correlations between the changes of within-subsystem and between-subsystem rsFC values and the clinical improvement were observed among the patients with MDD (  P  -values > 0.05, uncorrected). However, a significant negative correlation was found between the rsFC within the MTL subsystem at baseline and the clinical improvement, suggesting that the low rsFC within the MTL subsystem at baseline was associated with good clinical improvement (  r   = −0.33,   P   = 0.05, uncorrected). \n\n\n### Confirmation analyses \n  \nIn the confirmation analysis using the DMN regions from the Power 264 atlas as the 47 ROIs, the interaction effect showed a trend toward significance in the within-subsystem rsFC of the core subsystem (  P   = 0.07, FDR corrected) and the between-subsystem rsFC between the core and dMPFC subsystems (  P   = 0.06, FDR corrected). Post hoc analysis showed that the reduced within-subsystem and between-subsystem rsFC in the patients with MDD at baseline was also increased following treatment (  P  -values < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) and became comparable with those in the HCs. In addition, we found a significant group effect on the within-subsystem rsFC in the dMPFC subsystem (  P   < 0.05, FDR corrected). Thus, our main results were confirmed, except for the group effect on the MTL within-subsystem. Details could be found in the supplement materials (Fig.  ). No significant correlations were observed between the changes of within-subsystem and between-subsystem rsFC values and the clinical improvement (  P  -values > 0.05, uncorrected). The correlation between the rsFC within the MTL subsystem at baseline and the clinical improvement disappeared, and no correlations between the other DMN subsystem connectivity at baseline and the clinical improvement were observed in the confirmation analysis (  P  -values > 0.05, uncorrected). \n\nAmong patients completing the study, 28 were responders and 8 were non-responders. A two-way repeated-measure ANOVA was used to determine the main effects of subgroup (the responders vs. the non-responders), time (baseline vs. 12 weeks), and subgroup × time interaction on each within-subsystem rsFC and between-subsystem rsFC, with age, gender, educational level, and head motion (mean FD) as nuisance covariates. The significant main effect of subgroup or interaction effect was not observed on the DMN subsystem connectivity (  P  -values > 0.05, FDR corrected) (Table  ). However, the significant main effect of time on rsFC was noted between the core and dMPFC subsystem (  P   = 0.048, FDR corrected). A trend toward the significance of the main effect of time was also noted in the within-subsystem rsFC of the core subsystem (  P   = 0.051, FDR corrected). The main effect of time is consistent with our main finding, suggesting that rsFC related to the core subsystem increased after escitalopram treatment across patients with MDD. \n\nFurthermore, the main analyses were confirmed in patients with MDD who responded to escitalopram. Similar to the main findings, an interaction effect between group and time in the within-subsystem rsFC of the core subsystem (  P   < 0.05, uncorrected) and a trend towards significance in the interaction effect of the rsFC between the core subsystem and the dMPFC subsystem (  P   = 0.07, uncorrected) were observed. The significant main effect of group on within-subsystem rsFC in the dMPFC subsystem and the MTL subsystem was also noted (  P   < 0.05, uncorrected). However, due to the small sample size, these effects observed in the responders cannot survive from the multiple comparison corrections (  P  -values > 0.05, FDR corrected). No main effect of group or time was found in other within- or between-subsystem rsFC. Details can be found in the supplement materials (Fig.  ). \n\nFinally, no significant differences were found in within-subsystem rsFC or in the between-subsystem rsFC between at baseline and after the 12-week interval in the HCs (  P  -values > 0.05, FDR corrected) (Table  ). This result supports the stability of the main findings. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur study investigated the effects of escitalopram on the rsFC of the three DMN subsystems in patients with MDD. We observed that after escitalopram treatment for 12 weeks, decreased within-subsystem rsFC of the DMN core subsystem in patients with MDD was increased to a level similar to that seen in HCs. The same trend was found in the between-subsystem rsFC between the core and dMPFC subsystems at a looser threshold. We also found that the decreased within-subsystem rsFC persisted in the dMPFC and MTL subsystems after treatment. Moreover, our main results were confirmed using the DMN regions from another brain atlas. \n\nThe main finding is that the rsFC related to the DMN core subsystem (rsFC within this subsystem and rsFC between the core and dMPFC subsystem) in the patients with MDD decreased at baseline and then became comparable with that seen in HCs after escitalopram treatment for 12 weeks. The core subsystem, composed of the aMPFC and PCC as key nodes, is commonly regarded as a key network in patients with MDD due to its role in self-referential processing [ ,  ,  ]. Our finding supports DMN hypoconnectivity in patients with MDD at baseline. This finding seems to contradict previous reports, in which DMN hyperconnectivity was found in patients with MDD who have impaired self-referential processes, such as self-referential thought and maladaptive rumination [ ,  ]. However, after an exhaustive search on literature, researchers found that less than 50% of studies (  N   = 18) reported hyperconnectivity, 21% (  N   = 8) reported hypoconnectivity, 18% (  N   = 7) reported increased and decreased connectivity, and 13% (  N   = 5) reported no significant changes in the DMN of patients with MDD (38 reports) (for a review, please see also [ ]). Furthermore, a voxel-wise meta-analysis showed increased functional connectivity in the orbitofrontal DMN (including subgenual cingulate cortex) and decreased functional connectivity in the dMPFC and posterior DMN in patients with MDD [ ]. Moreover, the decreased rsFC related to the DMN core subsystem at baseline in the current work was generally consistent with the finding obtained by the largest MDD database of China [ ], in which the rsFC in the DMN was reduced in recurrent patients with MDD who had antidepressant treatments. The decreased rsFC between the core and dMPFC subsystems in the patients with MDD at baseline was also consistent with a previous study that recruited drug-naïve patients with MDD in the first episode [ ]. The inconsistency between our findings and previous studies on hyperconnectivity or the mixed findings in the DMN may be attributed to the heterogeneity in MDD. Based on the largest MDD database of China, researchers found that the DMN connectivity was not associated with illness duration and showed no significant differences among clinical sybtypes [ ]. The biotypes of MDD may account for the inconsistency across studies. The brain connectivity-based subtypes of MDD have been recently identified [ – ]. In particular, a study found decreased and increased DMN connectivity simultaneously occurring in patients with MDD, regardless of having the first episode. This finding suggests that the two biotypes of MDD exist, though no significant differences in demographic and clinical variables were found between patient subgroups [ ]. The current study cannot parse the biotypes of MDD due to the small sample size; however, our findings provide new evidence for the hypoconnectivity of the DMN in patients with MDD. It is possible that our samples and others in previous studies [ – ] may be occasionally constituted of patients whose rsFC related to the DMN at baseline decreased. Additional studies must recruit more patients and parse the biotypes of MDD to validate our findings. \n\nIt should be noted that the rsFC related to the core subsystem in the patients with MDD were increased after escitalopram treatment for 12 weeks and became comparable with those of the HCs in the current study. This finding is compatible with two previous studies. In one study, depressed elderly participants had significantly higher functional connectivity between the PCC and the MPFC after treatment relative to that before treatment; however, the significance disappeared after adjusting for WM hyperintensity burden [ ]. In another study, relative to placebo, acute citalopram administration increased rsFC between the PCC and MPFC [ ]. The 5-HT neurotransmitter system primarily modulated the regions within the core subsystem; however, the core subsystem had widely anatomical and functional connections with the dMPFC subsystem [ ,  ]. Therefore, in the current study, the change of the rsFC related to the core subsystem (rsFC within this subsystem and rsFC between the core and dMPFC subsystem) might indicate that escitalopram increases rsFC within the core subsystem by blocking the reuptake of the 5-HT and this effect extends to the rsFC between the core and dMPFC subsystem. The core subsystem is considered to integrate external or internal information with one’s prior episodic knowledge and current affective experience [ ]. The dMPFC subsystem is primarily active when participants are making affective self-referential cognition, which is correlated with the core subsystem [ ]. Thus, in the current study, the decreased rsFC related to the core subsystem in the patients with MDD at baseline might reflect the abnormalities in self-related processes in these patients and these abnormalities could be reversed by escitalopram treatment. This speculation can be supported by previous studies. Both of the decreased emotional response or brain activity to positive autobiographical memories and increased emotional response or brain activity to negative autobiographical memories are observed in the patients with MDD [ ,  ]. More importantly, the decreased brain activity in the amygdala to positive autobiographical memories in the SSRI responders after treatment was changed to a level similar to that seen in HCs [ ]. Future studies can use measurements on autobiographical memories or other self-related processes to test this speculation. In brief, our finding on the rsFC related to the core subsystem might be important to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms of escitalopram action in patients with MDD. \n\nIn the current study, the decreased within-subsystem rsFC in the dMPFC and MTL subsystems persisted in the patients with MDD after treatment. Decreased neurochemical changes within the dMPFC subsystem and decreased rsFC within the MTL subsystem have been reported in previous studies [ ,  ]. However, 12-week treatment of escitalopram did not change the decreased within-subsystem rsFC in the dMPFC and MTL subsystems in our study, which indicated that the decreased within-subsystem rsFC in the two subsystems might be independent of the presence of escitalopram therapy and thus might reflect disease-specific features of MDD. Therefore, these observations imply that the hypoconnectivity within the dMPFC and MTL subsystems may not be modulated by escitalopram and thus may reflect the abnormal neural circuit implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD. It is possible that the persistent abnormal functional connectivity within the dMPFC and MTL subsystems following treatment in patients with MDD may indicate a biomarker of diagnosis of MDD. However, due to the limited follow-up period (12 weeks), the possibility that the rsFC will be changed to a level similar to that seen in HCs after long-term treatment (e.g., 6 months or longer) cannot be excluded. Given the heterogeneity of MDD, future studies should recruit a large sample size and conduct a longitudinal design with a long follow-up period to validate the current findings. \n\nMoreover, our main results were confirmed by using the DMN regions from the Power 264 atlas, except for the group effect on within-subsystem rsFC in the MTL subsystem or the clinical correlates of this subsystem. The unstable finding in the MTL subsystem might be due to the difference between the two atlases. The ROIs obtained from the Power atlas were spheres with 5 mm radius, but those in Yeo’s template were clusters covering the whole ROI. The difference in ROIs might affect the estimation of rsFC, which has been repeatedly discussed in previous studies [ ,  ]. In the future, we hope to recruit other suitable templates to verify whether the group main effect in the MTL subsystem can be observed. \n\nInsignificant correlations were found between the changes of the DMN subsystem connectivity and the clinical improvement after the 12-week treatment of escitalopram. The correlation between the changes of rsFC and clinical improvement in depression severity, which suggests a match between symptomatic recovery and MDD neurobiology, must be further explored [ ]. However, only a few studies on the antidepressant’s effect on the rsFC have reported this correlation [ ,  – ], other works did not find [ ,  ,  ] or did not report this correlation [ ,  ]. The inconsistent findings combined with the small sample size across these studies (  N   = 12–21) appeal to future research with a large sample size to build a robust relationship between rsFC and clinical improvement. \n\nThe present study has several limitations. First, although patients who completed the study included responders (  N   = 28) and non-responders (  N   = 8) after the 12-week treatment of escitalopram, no difference was found between the responders and non-responders. Future studies must recruit additional MDD samples to find differences in the rsFC of the DMN between the responders and non-responders and verify the current results. Second, a placebo effect cannot be ruled out because we did not include a single group of MDD patients taking a placebo in the current study. The optimized controls would be groups of placebo-used or unmedicated patients with MDD. However, ethically speaking, asking patients with MDD who were experiencing depressive symptoms to remain untreated is a challenge. Therefore, recruiting patients with moderate depressive symptoms using a placebo for a short term could be helpful to confirm drug-specific effects in the future. Third, recent studies have shown that regions defined in the group-level atlas are suboptimal compared to individually specified regions in connectivity analyses [ ,  ]. Therefore, future work could use the individual-level functional mapping which may better identify the variations in the effect of antidepressant treatment on brain functions in patients with MDD. Finally, the state of mind was not evaluated during the resting-state scanning. Future studies should use inventories to quantify the resting-state cognition, including sleepiness, comfort, and discontinuity of mind [ ] to further understand the functional implications of the DMN subsystem connectivity. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur findings suggest that the DMN core subsystem may be a key DMN subsystem that plays an important role in the effect of escitalopram on brain functions for patients with MDD. We also found that the decreased within-subsystem rsFC in the dMPFC and MTL subsystems persisted in patients with MDD after treatment, indicating that the abnormality is independent of the presence of escitalopram therapy in MDD. The dissociation effect of escitalopram on the rsFC of DMN subnetworks deepens our understanding of the neural basis of antidepressants in patients with MDD. In addition, the persistent abnormal functional connectivity within the dMPFC and MTL subsystems following treatment in these patients may indicate a biomarker of diagnosis of MDD. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"2fc8bcda03ebd692d6960d92850643df"},

However, the implicit assumption of stationary and nondirectional functional connectivity (FC) in most previous resting-state fMRI studies raises an open question of JME-related aberrations in dynamic causal properties of FC. Here, we introduces an empirical method incorporating sliding-window approach and a multivariate Granger causality analysis to investigate, for the first time, the reorganization of dynamic effective connectivity (DEC) in DMN for patients with JME. DEC was obtained from resting-state fMRI of 34 patients with newly diagnosed and drug-naïve JME and 34 matched controls. Through clustering analysis, we found two distinct states that characterize the DEC patterns (i.e., a less frequent, strongly connected state (State 1) and a more frequent, weakly connected state (State 2)). Patients showed altered ECs within DMN subnetworks in the State 2, whereas abnormal ECs between DMN subnetworks were found in the State 1. Furthermore, we observed that the causal influence flows of the medial prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus were altered in a manner of state specificity, and associated with disease severity of patients. Overall, our findings extend the dysconnectivity hypothesis in JME from static to dynamic causal FC and demonstrate that aberrant DEC may underlie abnormal brain function in JME at early phase of illness. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nJuvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), characterized by myoclonic jerks of upper limbs after awakening, is the most common idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) syndrome in adults, accounting for up to 10% of all epilepsy cases ( ,  ,  ). Although response to appropriate antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is good, more patients seem to relapse after stopping AEDs than in any other epilepsy syndrome ( ). Patients with JME typically show various cognitive impairments, such as deficits in working memory, attention, and executive functions ( ,  ,  ), and these cognitive impairments severely affect patients’ quality of life and to some extent increase social and economic burden. Because of these apparent cognitive comorbidities, continuous efforts have been made to understand the fundamental mechanisms underlying the neuropsychology of JME ( ,  ,  ). \n\nWith advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques, researchers have made significant progress in understanding the pathogenesis of JME ( ,  ). There has been ample evidence of disrupted brain networks, including thalamo-cortical, fronto-insula, default modal, basal ganglia, sensorimotor networks, etc., in JME patients ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). However, studying the dysfunctions of brain networks in patients who have been treated with AEDs makes it difficult to differentiate brain changes caused by the disease itself from a potential prominent changes caused by AEDs. Thus, it is extremely essential to identify the changes of brain networks at early phase of the disease without the confounding effects of pharmacological treatment. \n\nThe default mode network (DMN) that is activated in a task-free state and suppressed during passive tasks, plays a pivotal role in many cognitive processes, such as remembering, envisioning the future and making social inferences ( ,  ). The main cortical regions within the DMN include the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC), precuneus (PCU), inferior parietal cortex, and hippocampus ( ). Functional disruption of the DMN have been recently revealed in patients with JME. For example, patients with JME showed decreased functional interactions between the PCC and MPFC ( ); the coupling of spontaneous fluctuation and functional connectivity (FC) in posterior regions of the DMN was altered in patients and associated with clinical symptoms during seizures ( ); aberrant FC in hippocampus was also involved in the cognitive dysregulation of JME ( ). Taken together, these findings suggested that the DMN is prominently affected in patients with JME ( ), and a specific investigation targeting DMN may lead new insights to revealing the pathogenesis of JME at the early phase of this disorder. It is noteworthy mentioning that the above-mentioned studies have measured FC by estimating the full time courses over the entire scan, and thus blurred the dynamic properties of brain activity over time. \n\nThe functional interaction in the brain is known to be highly dynamic rather than static ( ,  ). The dynamic FC therefore is considered to be a more efficient way for uncovering specific functional integration properties in healthy and disease ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The dynamic FC analysis have been utilized to explore time-varying abnormalities of resting-state networks (RSNs) in different subtypes of IGE as well as JME. For example, children with absence seizure (AS) showed altered dynamic connectivity maps in the thalamic network and the DMN across three different seizure intervals ( ); state-specific connectivity disruptions that mainly related to DMN were observed in patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) ( ). For patients with JME, hyper dynamic characteristics in temporally fluctuating functional networks have been found ( ). Our previous study also demonstrated altered FC dynamics within and between RSNs, which were associated with the disease severity of JME patients ( ). These studies suggested aberrant dynamic connectivity patterns of RSNs, particularly the DMN, are remarkable characteristics in patients with IGE. However, previous dynamic studies only characterized FC based on the temporal correlation between brain signals, ignoring the causal influences among brain regions (e.g., the influence of one brain regions on another ( )) that may provide more reasonable evidence for diagnosis, prognosis, and assessment of treatment responses of neurological and psychiatric disorders ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). To the best of our knowledge, no study has explored dynamic effective connectivity (DEC) in patients with JME, and the time-varying aspect of the causal influences among DMN regions for this disorder remains unclear. \n\nThe primary aim of this study is to investigate the differences in DEC within the DMN between healthy controls and patients with newly diagnosed and drug-naïve JME. To achieve this goal, we identified the default mode (DM) components by using a group independent component analysis (gICA), and then characterized DEC among the DM components by combining a sliding window approach with multivariate Granger causality analysis (mGCA). We further evaluated causal influence flows of DM components as well as temporal properties of dynamic states after clustering all DEC matrices into two EC states. Our DEC approach offers a practical way of examining the temporal patterns of the DMN connectivity in JME. Based upon the previous literature describing dysconnectivity of DMN and abnormalities of dynamic FC in JME, we hypothesized that patients with JME would exhibit atypical dynamic causal influence and temporal properties in the DMN vs. healthy controls, and these abnormal DEC patterns would be linked to clinical severity of JME. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe study sample consisted of 38 patients with newly diagnosed JME recruited at the Epilepsy Center of Lanzhou University Second Hospital between August 2016 and June 2018 and 37 matched healthy controls recruited from the local community through advertisements. The patients were diagnosed as JME based on the epilepsy classification criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) guidelines ( ). Routine MRI scans were normal, and routine scalp EEG showed 3–6 Hz generalized spike-wave or polyspike-wave discharges (GSWDs). Patients were excluded if they had any of the following characteristics: 1) a history of antiepileptic medication-intake, 2) had other neurological or psychiatric illness, 3) had other developmental disabilities, such as autism and intellectual impairment, and 4) had acute physical illness that would affect the scanning. To assess seizure severity, each patient was requested to perform the National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale (NHS3) prior to the MRI scans. The NHS3 measures seizure severity in a manner compatible with the subjective impression of people with epilepsy, focusing solely on the objective clinical events of a seizure ( ). It contains six seizure-related factors and generates a total score from 1 to 23. Healthy controls were additionally screened for history of febrile convulsions, seizures, or family history for epilepsy. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Lanzhou University Second Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant or one of his/her legal guardians after the explanation of the experimental protocol prior to imaging. \n\n\n### Data acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired on a Siemens Verio 3.0 T scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with 16 head-coil at the Department of Magnetic Resonance of Lanzhou University Second Hospital. Participants were instructed to keep still and remain as motionless as possible before the scanning. Participants were additionally required to stay awake with their eyes closed and not to think systematically during the scan. In order to further minimize the head motion, form pads provided by the scanner manufacturer were used to fix the head. Resting-state functional images were acquired for each participant using an echo-planar imaging sequence with the following settings: repetition time [RT] = 2000 ms; echo time [TE] = 30 ms; flip angle = 90°; slice thickness = 4 mm; in-plane matrix resolution = 64 × 64; field of view [FOV] = 240 × 240 mm ; slices = 33; number of total volumes = 200. For anatomical localization and normalization, high-resolution structural 3D T1-weighted images were obtained using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (TR = 1900 ms; TE = 2.99 ms; flip angle = 90°; slice thickness = 0.9 mm; acquisition matrix = 256 × 256; FOV = 230 × 230 mm ; in-plane resolution = 0.9 × 0.9 mm ; slices = 192). \n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nResting-state functional images were preprocessed using DPARSF software ( ) based on SPM12 ( ). The main procedures included discard of the first 10 functional images, realignment, time-slicing and head motion correction, spatial normalization into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half maximum. To minimize the effects of head motion on the estimation of dynamic EC, participants were excluded if they had: (1) head movement over than 2 mm translation or 2° rotation and (2) mean frame-wise displacement (FD) over than 0.3 mm. Seven participants (4 patients and 3 controls) failed to pass these criteria were excluded due to excessive head motion during MRI scanning. The detailed demographic and clinical characteristics of the included participants are shown in   and  .   \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of all participants. \n    \n\n\n### Overview of dynamic effective connectivity analysis \n  \nA schematic diagram of the analysis framework to investigate atypical dynamic EC of the DMN in JME was presented in  . Specifically, there were four major analysis steps in this framework. First, a group independent component analysis (ICA) was performed to decompose the preprocessed functional data into multiple independent components (ICs) and the DM components were identified according to their spatial activation maps. Second, to measure DEC among DM components, the time courses of DM components were divided into a set of windows by using a sliding window approach, and then the causal influence matrix in each window was constructed by using a multivariate Granger causality analysis (mGCA). Third, a k-means clustering method was implemented to cluster all DEC matrices into discrete EC states, which represented transient causal influences patterns during data acquisition time. Finally, state-specific causal influence flows among DM components and temporal properties of dynamic states were evaluated for each participant and their group differences between patients and controls were further compared. The detailed methods used for DEC analysis were provided in the following subsections.   \nAnalysis flowchart to study dynamic effective connectivity of the default mode network in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. \n  \n\n\n### Group independent component analysis \n  \nAfter data preprocessing, resting-sate data of all participants were decomposed into multiple ICs using spatial GICA with GIFT software ( ). The principal component analysis was first applied to reduce subject-specific data into 120 principal components, and then all participant-reduced data across time was concatenated and decomposed into 100 ICs using the infomax algorithm ( ). The infomax ICA algorithm was repeated 20 times in ICASSO to ensure the reliability and stability. After estimating the group spatial maps, a back reconstruction approach was used to obtain subject-specific spatial maps and corresponding time courses. We then applied a combination of spatial template-matching and visual inspection to identify DM components. Templates were derived from the ICA analyses as described in previous studies ( ,  ). Components were further evaluated according to the following criteria: 1) peak activation coordinates were located primarily in gray matter; 2) low spatial overlap with known vascular, ventricular, motion, and susceptibility artifacts; and 3) time courses were dominated by low-frequency fluctuations ( ). Moreover, to remove remaining noise sources, a post-processing was performed on the time courses of selected DM components, including detrended linear, quadratic and cubic trends, regressed out six realignment parameters and their temporal derivatives, despiked detected outliers using 3DDESPIKE algorithm, and low-pass filtered with a cutoff frequency of 0.15 Hz. \n\n\n### Dynamic effective connectivity estimation \n  \n#### Multivariate Granger causality analysis \n  \nAs a popular method for predicting causal influence of one system exerts over another, the Granger causality analysis (GCA) has been widely used to explore EC between brain regions in resting-state fMRI data ( ,  ). Different from other measures of EC, GCA quantified the causal influence among multiple brain regions in a data-driven way without requiring any predefined model ( ). The idea of GCA can be simply depicted as, for two time signals   s  (  t  ) and   s  (  t  ), if knowing the past information of   s  (  t  ) could help to predict the future of   s  (  t  ),   s  (  t  ) has a causal influence on   s  (  t  ). In this study, the causal influences among the time courses of DM components were evaluated using the mGCA method ( ). For each participant, the time courses set was defined as   S  (  t  ) = (  s  (  t  ),   s  (  t  ), …,   s  (  t  )), where   n   denotes the number of DM components. The influence from all other seed components to target component   k   was evaluated by the multivariate auto-regressive model as follow: where   p  ,   C  ,   S   and   R   denote the auto-regressive model order, model coefficient matrix, time courses matrix of different components and residual error matrix, respectively. The model order   p   was determined using Akaike’s information criterion and the model coefficient matrix   C   was calculated using a standard least squares optimization. To assess the statistical significance of Granger causality results, random-effect Granger causality maps were further calculated for each participant. The statistical thresholds for these maps were corrected with false discovery rate (  P   < 0.05). \n\n\n#### Sliding window approach \n  \nThe DEC among DM components was estimated using the sliding window approach, which is the most common way to investigate dynamics of brain connectivity in previous studies. A tapered window was created by convolving a rectangle window of 22 TRs (44 s) size with a Gaussian (σ = 3), and then slid it along time in steps of 1 TR, resulting in total 169 windows for each participant across the entire scan (190 TRs). Particularly, the window size of 22 TRs was selected because it has been demonstrated to provide a good cutoff between the ability of dynamics detection and the quality of correlation matrix estimation ( ). Using the time courses of all DM components within each window, 169 EC matrices with   n   ×   n   size were obtained for each participant, representing the dynamic changes of EC within DMN during resting-state data acquisition time. Since previous studies suggested that dynamic connectivity patterns could be captured stably in the range of 30 to 60 s, DEC was also estimated in other window sizes, such as 15, 18, 20, 25, 28, and 30 TRs to validate our main results. \n\n\n#### Clustering analysis \n  \nTo identify the reoccurring DEC states (depicting transient EC patterns over time), a k-means clustering method was performed on the windowed EC matrices for all participants. These matrices were categorized into a set of distinct clusters (corresponding different states) based on the similarity between matrices and cluster centroids. Here, the similarity was measured using the L1 distance (Manhattan distance) function, which is a practical method for high dimensional data ( ). The k-means clustering algorithm was repeated 100 times to reduce the random selection bias of initialized centroid position. The optimal number of clusters was estimated using the silhouette statistic (defined as the ratio of similarity between windows in the same cluster to similarity with windows in a different cluster) and the gap statistic (defined as the standardized pooled within-cluster sum of squares in within-cluster dispersion that is expected under a reference null distribution). In addition, the state was considered as a reliable state when it covered at least 10 windows in this study. \n\n\n\n### Causal influence flows analysis and temporal properties analysis \n  \nWe performed a causal influence flows analysis to investigate state-specific directed interactions among DM components and compared it between patients and controls. Two weighted degree measures including in-weighted degree and out-weighted degree, the most common used measures of causal influence flows ( ), were calculated in each state. Here, we defined in-weighted degree of a component (or node) as the sum of influence strength from any other component to it, while defined out-weighted degree of a component as the sum of influence strength from it to any other component. In general, the component with high in-weighted degree (out-weighted degree) was considered to be a hub receptor (hub generator) of the network and often played an important role in functional integration. To assess net influence for each component, we further calculated the in-out-weighted degree on DEC matrices, which is defined as the subtraction of in-weighted degree and out-weighted degree. \n\nIn line with previous studies ( ,  ), we computed three different variables including fractional windows, number of transitions, and mean dwell time to evaluate the temporal properties of DEC states for each participant. Specifically, the fractional windows was defined as the proportion of windows belonging to each state, the number of transitions was defined as the transition times between states and represented the stability over time, and the mean dwell time was defined as the average number of consecutive windows belonging to each state and represented the staying time in a certain state. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe group differences in DEC parameters, including state-specific EC patterns, causal influence flows among DM components, and temporal properties of DEC states, were explored using two-sample   t  -test. Furthermore, Spearman’s correlation analyses were applied to investigate the relationships between altered DEC parameters and clinical features in JME patients, with age, gender, and mean FD regressed out. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0 and results were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR;   P   < 0.05). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Default mode components \n  \nEleven ICs were identified as DM components, located in multiple brain regions including the medial frontal gyrus (MFG; IC19, IC51, and IC87), hippocampus (Hip; IC41), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; IC42), precuneus (PCU; IC48 and IC50), angular gyrus (Ang; IC66 and IC81), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; IC73), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL; IC91). According to their spatial locations, these components can be further divided into two subnetworks such as anterior DMN (IC19, IC42, IC51, and IC87) and posterior DMN (IC41, IC48, IC50, IC66, IC81, IC 73, and IC91). The spatial maps of the DM components are shown in  A. We also computed the group averaged static causal influences among DM components over the entire scan and the corresponding EC matrix is shown in  B. The detailed information of these DM components is provided in  .   \nDefault mode components identified by a group independent component analysis. (A) Eleven independent components (ICs) were defined as default mode components according to their spatial activation maps. (B) Group averaged static effective connectivity (EC) between default mode component pairs was computed using an entire scan. The color-coded legend located on the left and at the bottom side of the matrix in (B) matches the overlaid colors of the spatial maps in (A). \n  \n\n\n### Effective connectivity patterns in dynamic states \n  \nTwo structured EC states across all participants were identified using the k-means clustering method. As shown in  , the DEC patterns (cluster centroids) among DM components are very different between the two states. Specifically, in State 1, the DEC pattern showed stronger inter-influence but lower percentages of total occurrences (31.03%), whereas in State 2, the DEC pattern showed weaker inter-influence but more frequently total occurrences (68.97%). We also estimated and clustered DEC matrices with other sliding window sizes, and found that the DEC patterns were consistent across different sliding window sizes (see details in  ).   \nClustering analysis results for each state across the entire group.

Compared with controls, patients with JME exhibited increased EC from IC50 to IC42 and decreased EC from IC81 to IC51 in State 1; and showed increased EC from IC51 to IC42 and decreased EC from IC81 to IC66 as well as from IC66 to IC48 in State 2 ( B,   P   < 0.05 with FDR corrected). We also observed that these changed ECs in State 1 were located between DMN subnetworks, while in State 2 were located within DMN subnetworks.   \nDynamic effective connectivity patterns for two groups.

In State 1, compared with controls, patients exhibited significantly decreased in-weighted degree from other DM components to IC51, decreased out-weighted degree from IC81 to other DM components, and decreased in-out-weighted degree of IC51 (  P   < 0.05, FDR corrected). In State 2, patients exhibited significantly increased out-weighted degree from IC51 to other DM components, but significantly decreased out-weighted degree from IC81 to other DM components and in-out-weighted degree of IC51 (  P   < 0.05, FDR corrected). We further explored the temporal properties (fractional windows, number of transitions, and dwell time) in each group, but no significant between-group differences were found. The statistical results of these temporal properties are provided in  .   \nCausal influence flows of dynamic effective connectivity.

We further explored the associations between abnormal causal influence flows and clinical features. As shown in  , we found that the NHS3 total scores of patients were significantly correlated with out-weighted degree from IC81 to other DM components in State 1 (  r   = -0.41,   P   = 0.016, FDR corrected) and in-out-weighted degree of IC51 in State 2 (  r   = -0.43,   P   = 0.011, FDR corrected).   \nRelationships between clinical features and causal influence flows.

The primary findings are as follows: first, we found that the transient patterns of causal influences within the DMN have two distinct configurations, a less frequent, strongly-connected state (State 1) and a more frequent, weakly-connected state (State 2), across the two groups; second, compared with controls, patients with JME showed state-specific EC changes among several DMN regions, particularly exhibited altered ECs between DMN subnetworks in State 1 as well as abnormal ECs within DMN subnetworks in State 2; third, causal influence flows among DMN regions were also altered across two states and associated with the disease severity of JME assessed by the NHS3 score. All these results provide a new account of neuropsychological mechanisms of JME at the early phase of the disease. \n\nThe present work from the perspective of EC identified two distinct dynamic state profiles, a less frequent state characterized by strongly-connected inter-influence among DM components (State 1) and a more frequent state characterized by weakly-connected inter-influence among DM components (State 2). The identified states were in line with the dynamic FC patterns presented in prior findings ( ). Indeed, dynamic FC analysis usually estimates and characterizes windowed FC matrices into several distinct connectivity states that represent the transient patterns of FC over time ( ,  ). Although the underlying cognitive processes remains largely unknown, these diverse FC states are believed to reflect distinct internal states of the brain (e.g. a state of alertness or drowsiness), in terms of functional interactions ( ,  ,  ). This can be supported by the evidence that dynamic FC states derived from rs-fMRI are linked to discrete mental states observed in EEG measurements ( ). Our results may extend to previous findings, suggesting that different causal influence patterns might also be related to discrete brain cognitive states during resting-state. Furthermore, previous research suggested that the DMN is in charge of both the internal thoughts and response to external stimuli in resting-state, and these two aspects can be reflected by distinct connective patterns of the DMN ( ) and related to the switches between different phases of attention ( ). Considering the role of the DMN in supporting the internal mentation and monitoring the external environment, we can speculate that the State 1 may be an internal-oriented state which supports internally constructed representations, and the State 2 may be an external-oriented state which supports externally constrained representations. Our speculation can be supported by the findings of whole-brain dynamic network connectivity analyses that diverse dynamic FC states may reflect the forms of functional communication in the brain networks and thus support different cognitive processes ( ,  ). Future studies are needed to disentangle the relationships between these different states of the DMN and specific cognitive processing. \n\nPatients in this study exhibited changed ECs among multiple DM components, specifically between the PCU (IC48 and IC50), ACC (IC42), MFG (IC51), and Ang (IC66 and IC81). The PCU is a key region of the DMN and associated with emotion regulation ( ). Previous studies have suggested that the PCU plays an important role in onset of spike-and-wave discharge in JME ( ). Our altered ECs between PCU and other regions are in line with previous studies, which have revealed PCU-related dysconnectivity in JME ( ,  ), suggesting a critical role of emotional dysregulation in the development of JME. The ACC is typically related to emotional processing ( ), and its alterations in structure and function have been revealed in patients with JME ( ,  ). Our altered ECs of ACC suggest that atypical emotional processing has been implicated in the neuropsychology of JME. The MFG has been associated with internal mentation and self-reference processing ( ,  ). Previous studies have frequently reported dysconnectivity of MFG with motor system in patients with JME (Christian  ,  ). Consistently, our altered ECs of MFG suggest that abnormal internal cognitive process may contribute to myoclonic jerks in JME. In addition, the Ang is involved in social cognition and language ( ,  ), and its dysconnectivity with other DMN regions has been reported in JME ( ). Overall, the altered ECs among these DMN components may implicate neuropsychological impairments in patients with JME. More importantly, we found that these changed ECs were located between anterior (e.g. ACC and MFG) and posterior DMN (e.g. PCU and Ang) regions in State 1, whereas within anterior and posterior DMN regions in State 2, suggesting state-specific abnormalities in EC patterns. Previous static FC studies have indicated that JME patients had lower mean connective strength between anterior and posterior DMN regions ( ). The present study extends current research to temporal dynamic domain and further suggests that disrupted functional integration between DMN subnetworks may be dominated by an internal-oriented state, whereas disrupted functional segregation within DMN subnetworks may be dominated by an external-oriented state in patients. \n\nOur results also showed that the causal influence flows related to MFG (IC51) and left Ang (IC81) have been altered across two states in the patient cohort, suggesting a disrupted role of these regions as a hub receptor and generator in functional interaction. Previous studies have demonstrated that the causal influence flows among the DMN regions were correlated with their neuronal activity levels ( ). The abnormal activity in the MFG and Ang have been widely found in JME ( ,  ), the altered causal influence flows of these regions may reflect disabilities in receiving and generating influences with other DMN regions. Interestingly, the MFG showed decreased in-weighted degree in Stated 1, whereas exhibited increased out-weighted degree in State 2, indicating state-specific alterations of causal influence flows in patients with JME. The MFG has been implicated in integrating the external environment with stored internal representations ( ), and the abnormal MFG connectivity is associated with abnormal internal representations on specific cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, and consciousness, for both chronic illness and newly diagnosed JME patients ( ,  ). Also, the MFG is involved with the thalamo-cortical circuit, and its connectivity reduces with the basal ganglia reflects the disruption of external interaction which is related to executing voluntary movements in JME ( ). Our state-specific results suggest that, for patients with newly diagnosed drug-naïve JME, the MFG became less important in supporting internally constructed representations when it served as a hub receptor in the DMN; on the contrary, as a hub generator of the DMN, the MFG played a more important role in supporting externally constrained representations. This can be seen as a compensatory process, where the functional interaction decreases in an internal-oriented state while increases in an external-oriented state in patients with JME. \n\nWe also found that the altered causal influence flows were significantly correlated with NHS3 scores in patients with JME, suggesting the lower directed interactions are corresponding to the greater disease severity. These results were consistent with previous observations of associations between atypical brain dynamics and epileptic symptoms ( ; H.  ). A recent study reported that patients with GTCS showed enhanced temporal variability of FC in large-scale brain functional networks, with these excessive variability anti-correlated with the duration of disease ( ). Our previous study also suggested that reduced dynamics within and between RSNs were linked to greater disease severity in JME ( ). Taken together, the established associations in this study indicate that the early identified abnormalities in brain networks may be implicated in the progress of the disease, and can be an indication of disrupted developmental processes in JME. \n\nOur study was subject to various considerations and limitations. First, although the GCA is considered to be an effective method for evaluating EC in rs-fMRI data, it has been claimed that the changes in directionality can be caused by the differences in hemodynamic coupling among different brain regions ( ). Recently, other models, particularly the dynamic causal model (DCM) - a hemodynamic model ( ), have been proposed to detect dynamic EC among hidden neuronal states ( ,  ). Therefore, it would be interesting to see future attempts utilizing DCM to examine the reorganizations of dynamic EC in patients with ME. Second, previous studies have suggested that the epileptic transients may have significant effect on the functional connectivity ( ). However, in the present study, the EEG data was not recorded during rs-fMRI scanning since it is difficult for participants to continue to not move their head during scanning. In the future, it would be important to evaluate the influence of the interictal epileptic discharges on dynamic brain networks by using a simultaneous EEG-fMRI analysis. Third, in order to investigate the intrinsic disease process on reorganization of dynamic EC rather than the effect of direct pharmacological treatment, we opted for a homogeneous cohort of newly diagnosed drug-naïve JME. Although this is an advantage of the study, our sample size is subsequently small. Our sample size was comparable with other recent studies that examined patients with newly diagnosed JME ( ) and dynamic FC ( ). Nonetheless, further study with a larger sample set is needed to investigate the replicability of our findings. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe current study adopts a novel DEC method that combined a sliding window approach with a multivariate Granger causality analysis to study the dynamic alterations of causal influence within the DMN in patients with newly diagnosed and drug-naïve JME. Our results showed that temporal patterns of causal influences within the DMN are altered in patients, and were associated with clinical symptoms in patients. Our findings extend current research regarding the DMN disruption in JME patients and suggest that dynamic effective connectivity could be a potential way to uncover the pathophysiology of JME at the early phase of illness. \n\n\n## Contributor’s statements \n  \nZZ designed the study and performed statistical analyses, drafted the manuscript, and approved the final manuscript as submitted.

Previous studies have suggested that brain tumors can induce a loss of functional connectivity and alter the brain network architecture. Little is known about the effect of brain metastases on whole-brain functional and structural connectivity networks. In this study, 14 patients with brain metastases and 16 healthy controls underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We constructed functional connectivity network using rs-fMRI signal correlations and structural connectivity network using DTI tractography. Graph theoretical analysis was employed to calculate network properties. We further evaluated the performance of brain networks after metastases resection by a simulated method. Compared to healthy controls, patients with brain metastases showed an altered “small-world” architecture in both functional and structural connectivity networks, shifting to a more randomness organization. Besides, the coupling strength of functional-structural connectivity was decreased in patients. After removing nodes infiltrated by metastases, aggravated disruptions were found in both functional and structural connectivity networks, and the alterations of network properties correlated with the removed hubs number. Our findings suggest that brain metastases interfere with the optimal network organization and relationship of functional and structural connectivity networks, and tumor resection involving hubs could cause a worse performance of brain networks. This study provides neuroimaging guidance for neurosurgical planning and postoperative assessment of brain metastases from the aspect of brain networks. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMetastases are the most prevalent tumors in the brain and are commonly associated with high morbidity and mortality [ ]. Lung, breast, and skin are the three most common primary sites for brain metastases [ ]. Possibly as a result of improvements in detection and treatment of primary cancers, the incidence of brain metastases has an increasing trend [ ]. For brain metastases close to or located in eloquent areas, both itself and it’s treatment could lead to neurological deficits or cognitive dysfunctions [ , ]. The neurocognitive dysfunctions caused by tumors generally are involved in alterations of widespread functional networks rather than a focal alteration of brain functions [ ]. \n\nSeveral neuroimaging studies have investigated the functional connectivity alteration in tumor patients. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocorticographic studies reported a decrease of functional connectivity in patients with cortical lesions such as tumors [ , ].Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), Bartolomei et al. [ , ] found that brain tumors can induce diffuse, not focal, decreases in functional connectivity, and alter the network architecture of the brain. Douw et al. [ ] investigated the effects of tumor treatment on functional connectivity in 15 tumor patients using MEG, and found that functional connectivity changed in a complex manner after tumor resection. Using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI), previous studies have demonstrated that altered activation patterns are not only found within the lesion regions but are often present in distant brain regions in tumor patients [ , ]. Thus, functional connectivity analysis can help us to understand the effect of a brain tumor on spatially distributed but temporally correlated network in the brain [ ]. \n\nIn addition to functional connectivity, structural connectivity in tumor patients could also be altered when brain tumors are close to or located in the white matter of the brain. Therefore, it is crucial to know the alterations of functional and structural connectivity networks in tumor patients. Functional connectivity network can be constructed by using EEG, MEG or BOLD-fMRI [ ]. Unlike EEG and MEG based functional connectivity networks which were measured by extra-cerebral sensors, functional connectivity network by using BOLD-fMRI depicts temporal dependencies between distinct brain regions [ ]. Structural connectivity network based on white matter tracts quantified by diffusion tractography [ ], gives insights into microstructural white matter architecture. Prior studies have proved that structural connectivity is highly predictive of and places constraints on functional interactions across the human brain network [ , ]. Accordingly, structural connectivity is considered as the physical substrate of functional connectivity [ ]. In turn, functional connectivity may influence structural connectivity through brain plasticity [ ]. The relationship (coupling) between functional and structural connectivity has been found to enhance with age during normal development [ ], and disrupt in disease states [ – ]. So, it could be more sensitive to detect subtle brain pathophysiological abnormalities by using the coupling of functional-structural connectivity than any single modality [ ]. Moreover, the human brain network is an efficient complex network with a “small-world” topology [ ]. Using graph analysis, Bartolomei et al. [ ] found that tumor patients showed a changed “small-world” network architecture in the functional connectivity network. Assessment at network level allows to inspect topological properties of normal and pathological brain networks [ ]. \n\nOn the basis of the aforementioned findings, we predict that brain metastases may alter network topological characteristics as well as the relationship of functional and structural connectivity. Therefore, one aim of the present work is to evaluate the impact of brain metastases on whole-brain functional and structural connectivity networks. For patients with less than three metastases, surgical resection is generally considered as a valid treatment to extend the survival time [ ]. However, little is known about whether regions infiltrated by metastases can be resected since its resection may induce neurocognitive impairments [ ]. Thus, our second aim is to investigate changes of functional and structural connectivity networks after tumor removal and further assess the association between these changes and the removed region numbers from the aspect of brain networks. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study included 16 patients (13 males, mean age: 61.00 ± 7.80 years) with newly diagnosed brain metastatic tumors and 16 healthy controls (11 males, mean age: 57.13 ± 10.92 years), matched in age (  p   = 0.1861, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test) and sex (  p   = 0.6851, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test). The recruitment was performed from September 2016 to May 2017. Some of these participants have been used in our previous study [ ]. For each subject, we performed a conventional MRI protocol for routine investigation, including T1/T2-weighted imaging, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging and diffusion weighted imaging. The patients were recruited from the department of neurosurgery at Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College. The inclusion criteria were: 1) the age was greater than or equal to 18 years; 2) the number of metastases was no more than three; 3) the patients had known primary tumor sites; 4) the patients had no history of brain surgery or other neurological disease (e.g. traumatic brain injury, stroke or other focal brain lesions); 5) the patients had no intra-tumoral hemorrhage or prior cerebral hemorrhage; 6) the patients had no significant peritumoral brain edema. Then, one patient with five metastases and one with obvious encephalomalacia caused by prior cerebral hemorrhage were excluded, and 14 brain metastatic patients were therefore used for the following analyses. Out of 14 patients, nine patients had suffered from a single brain metastasis and five from two to three brain metastases. Thirteen patients had the primary tumor site in the lung and one in the rectum. Demographic and clinical data of brain metastases are shown in  . The healthy controls were recruited from the staff of Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College. The inclusion criteria included: 1) no gross brain abnormalities in brain MRI images; 2) no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. \n\nThe study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China. The methods used in this study were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to enrollment in the experiments. Authors had no access to information that could identify individual participants during or after data collection. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nAll imaging data were collected on a 3.0-T MR scanner (Discovery 750; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis). During data acquisition, subjects were instructed to relax with their eyes closed, not to fall asleep, and to keep their heads still. Foam padding and earplugs were used to minimize head motion and scanner noise. The resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data were acquired by using an echo-planar-imaging sequence with the following parameters: repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE] = 2000/30 ms, field of view = 220×220 mm , matrix = 64×64, voxel size = 3.44×3.44×3.2 mm , 35 axial slices without slice gap, flip angle = 90°, and a total of 210 volumes for each subject. The diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were collected by using a single-shot echo-planar-imaging sequence, including 25 volumes with diffusion sensitizing gradients applied along 25 non-collinear directions (b = 1000 s/mm ) and one volume without diffusion weighting (b = 0 s/mm ). The acquisition parameters were: TR/TE = 8637/64.1 ms, field of view = 96×96 mm , matrix = 128×128, voxel size = 0.75×0.75×1.5 mm , 81 axial slices without slice gap, and flip angle = 90°. The high-resolution T1-weighted structural images were also acquired by using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence with the following parameters: TR/ TE = 6.652/2.928 ms, field of view = 256×256 mm , matrix = 256×256, voxel size = 1×1×1mm , 192 sagittal slices without slice gap, and flip angle = 12°. Here, the acquisition parameters for the rs-fMRI and T1-weighted structural data were the same as in our previous study [ ]. \n\n\n### Brain network construction \n  \n#### Network node definition \n  \nWe employed the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template [ ] to parcellate the whole brain into 90 cortical and subcortical regions ( ). Furthermore, we constructed a high-resolution network with 1024 regions. See   for details. The two parcellation schemes were defined as AAL-90 and AAL-1024 respectively and applied to the following network analyses, as our previous study [ ]. \n\n\n#### Edge definition of functional connectivity network \n  \nFunctional images were corrected for temporal differences and head motion, and then normalized to MNI space. For the patients, we additionally used a cost-function modification to avoid transformation bias since the tumor tissue may lead to distortions during normalization [ , ]. Then, several nuisance parameters were regressed out of the data at each brain voxel. The resulting residuals were temporally band-pass-filtered (0.01–0.1 Hz). We acquired the correlation matrix for each subject using Pearson correlation analysis. The absolute correlation coefficient |  r  | between region   i   and   j   was defined as the weighted edge   w   of functional connectivity network. Since the mechanisms of negative functional connectivity are still less understood [ ], we also constructed weighted functional connectivity network with only positive correlation coefficient and performed the following network analyses. See   for details. \n\n\n#### Edge definition of structural connectivity network \n  \nDiffusion weighted images were corrected for head motions and eddy current distortions. The diffusion tensor models were then estimated by using the Diffusion Toolkit [ ], and fiber tracking was implemented in the DTI native space using Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking (FACT) algorithm [ ]. For structural connectivity network, nodes were defined in the DTI native space [ , ]. Here, a cost-function modification was also additionally used to avoid tumor-induced transformation bias in the patients [ , ]. We constructed weighted structural connectivity network and defined its weighted edge   w  (  e  ) as:  .   S   and   S   are two-dimension intersects of the individual’s white matter with AAL region   i   and   j  , respectively [ , ];   F  (  e  ) refers to the fibres set connecting regions   i   and   j  ;   l  (  f  ) refers to the length of the fiber   f  . Structural connectivity weights were further scaled by the maximum of this matrix in each subject [ ]. See   for details. \n\n\n\n### Network topological analysis \n  \nWe performed graph theoretical analysis to compute network topological properties via the Brain Connectivity Toolbox ( ) [ ]. The global network properties such as connectivity strength   S  , normalized weighted clustering coefficient   γ  , normalized weighted characteristic path length   λ   and the small-worldness   σ   were evaluated. To determine the global role of each node in the brain networks, we also computed the nodal properties including nodal connectivity strength   S  , efficiency   E   and normalized betweenness centrality   b  . Nodes with high connectivity strength, efficiency or betweenness centrality (> mean + SD) were considered as global hubs in the brain network [ ]. See   for details. \n\n\n### Coupling analysis of functional-structural connectivity \n  \nIn line with our previous studies [ , ], we constrained the coupling analysis by the edges with existing (non-zero) structural connectivity. The coupling of functional-structural connectivity was obtained by calculating Pearson’s correlation between functional and structural connectivity values. See   for details. \n\n\n### Network analysis after tumors removal \n  \nTo describe the influence of tumor resection on brain functional and structural networks, a simulated procedure was performed. Firstly, we identified the nodes infiltrated by brain tumors in each patient. Then, we computed the functional-structural connectivity coupling, and global network properties of functional and structural networks after removing these nodes and the corresponding connections for each patient. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe network topological parameters may change with the threshold selection. To comprehensively evaluate the tumor-induced network changes, we computed network topological properties using a range of cost thresholds (0.1≤cost≤0.26 for the AAL-90 scheme, 0.019≤cost≤0.036 for the AAL-1024 scheme) ( ). To avoid possible bias on network analysis from single threshold, we further computed the area under the curve (AUC) of network topological properties. \n\nFor group comparisons of global network properties and the coupling of functional-structural connectivity between controls and patients, two-sample two-tailed   t  -test was performed. The statistical significance for these group comparisons was determined using a nonparametric permutation test method [ , ]. The permutations were performed 5000 times to test whether the group differences were significant. A threshold of   α   = 0.05 was used for testing network properties and coupling strength. \n\nFurthermore, paired-samples   t  -test was employed to assess the difference of global network properties and the functional-structural connectivity coupling in patients before and after tumor removal. The significance threshold strategy was carried out as above. To further evaluate the relationship of altered network properties and coupling strength with the tumor removal, Spearman correlation analysis was performed between these network alterations and the number of hubs infiltrated by tumors. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Hub distributions \n  \nWe calculated nodal properties and identified global hubs which had high connectivity strength, efficiency or betweenness centrality. The hub distributions were similar to those reported in previous studies [ , , , , ]. For the functional connectivity network under AAL-90 parcellation, twelve nodes were identified as global hubs in both controls and patients, including bilateral insula, left precuneus, angular gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, medial orbital part of superior frontal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus ( ). For the structural connectivity network under AAL-90 parcellation, thirteen nodes were considered as hubs in both controls and patients, including bilateral orbital part of superior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, left insula, middle occipital gyrus, right dorsolateral part of superior frontal gyrus, superior parietal gyrus and putamen ( ). The similar hub distributions were found in the functional and structural connectivity networks using the AAL-1024 scheme ( ). In addition, we also displayed the hub distributions of functional connectivity networks constructed by only positive correlation coefficients in the two groups ( ), which were partly different to those of functional connectivity networks constructed by absolute correlation coefficients. \n   Hub distributions of AAL-90 FCN and SCN in healthy controls and patients with brain metastases.  \nThe results are visualized with the BrainNet viewer (NKLCNL, Beijing Normal University, China). (a) functional connectivity network, twelve hubs were identified in both healthy controls and patients, including bilateral insula, left precuneus, angular gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, medial orbital part of superior frontal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus. (b) structural connectivity network, thirteen hubs were identified in both healthy controls and patients, including bilateral orbital part of superior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, left insula, middle occipital gyrus, right dorsolateral part of superior frontal gyrus, superior parietal gyrus and putamen. The red spheres and the grey dots denote hub and non-hub regions, respectively. The nodal regions are located according to their centroid stereotaxic coordinates.

Additionally, functional connectivity networks constructed by both AAL-90 and AAL-1024 schemes in patients showed a decreased normalized characteristic path length   λ  , while structural connectivity network constructed by AAL-1024 scheme had a decreased small-worldness   σ   and normalized clustering coefficient   γ   (permutation testing,   p  <0.05) ( ). To compare the integrated AUC of each global network property, we found a similar patterns of topological alterations in patients: decreased normalized characteristic path length   λ   for the functional connectivity network under AAL-90 parcellation, and decreased small-worldness   σ   and normalized clustering coefficient   γ   for the structural connectivity network under AAL-1024 parcellation (permutation testing,   p  <0.05) ( ). \n   Global network properties of brain networks as a function of cost threshold.  \n(a) functional connectivity network under AAL-90 scheme.

The alteration of connectivity strength   S   was negatively correlated with the number of removed hubs for both functional and structural connectivity networks under AAL-90 parcellation (  r   = −0.7970,   p   = 0.0006 for the former;   r   = −0.6708,   p   = 0.0086 for the later). There was a negative correlation trend between the removed hubs number and the alteration of the small-worldness   σ   (  r   = −0.4974,   p   = 0.0704) and normalized clustering coefficient   γ   (  r   = −0.4883,   p   = 0.0764) for the structural connectivity network under AAL-1024 parcellation ( ). \n   Correlations between altered network properties and the removed hubs number in patients with brain metastases.  \n(a) altered network connectivity strength   S   of AAL-90 FCN negatively correlated with the removed hubs number (  r   = −0.7970,   p   = 0.0006). (b) altered network connectivity strength   S   of AAL-90 SCN negatively correlated with the removed hubs number (  r   = −0.6708,   p   = 0.0086). (c) altered small-worldness   σ   of AAL-1024 SCN showed a negative correlation trend with the removed hubs number (  r   = −0.4974,   p   = 0.0704). (d) altered normalized clustering coefficient   γ   of AAL-1024 SCN showed a negative correlation trend with the removed hubs number (  r   = −0.4883,   p   = 0.0764).

Consistent with the results from the functional connectivity network constructed by absolute correlation coefficients, a decreased normalized characteristic path length   λ   under AAL-90 parcellation was found in patients compared to controls (  and   Figs). After removing the nodes infiltrated by tumors in patients, we also found a decreased connectivity strength   S   under AAL-90 parcellation ( ), which negatively correlated with the number of removed hubs (  r   = −0.8546,   p  <0.001) ( ). \n\n\n### Functional-structural connectivity coupling \n  \nFunctional connection values distributed over a wide range whether there existed structural connections or not. Constrained by existing structural connections, a positive correlation was found between functional connectivity values and structural connectivity values in each subject. These features of functional-structural connectivity coupling were found for both AAL-90 and AAL-1024 parcellations ( ). \n  \nFunctional-structural connectivity coupling under AAL-90 scheme (a-c) and AAL-1024 scheme (d-f).

Paired-samples   t  -test was employed for group comparison in patients before and after tumor removal. FC, functional connectivity; SC, structural connectivity; n.s., no significant difference; patients_del, patients after tumor deletion. \n  \nCompared to controls (0.3236±0.0440 for AAL-90 and 0.3482±0.0322 for AAL-1024), the patients with brain metastases (0.2790±0.0444 for AAL-90 and 0.3224±0.0467 for AAL-1024) revealed a significant decrease in the coupling strength of functional-structural connectivity (  p   = 0.0034 for AAL-90;   p   = 0.0388 for AAL-1024). There was no significant difference of the coupling strength in patients before and after tumor removal for neither AAL-90 nor AAL-1024 parcellations ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis is the first study to investigate the effect of brain metastases on both functional and structural connectivity networks using graph theoretical analysis. Our main findings are as follows: (i) patients with brain metastases had an altered “small-world” architecture in both functional and structural connectivity networks, suggesting a more randomness organization of brain networks; (ii) the coupling strength between functional and structural connectivity networks was significantly decreased in patients; (iii) after removing nodes infiltrated by tumors, some network properties showed a more decrease in patients, and the alteration negatively correlated with the removed hubs number. These findings demonstrate a tumor-induced alteration of network organization and relationship between functional and structural connectivity, providing neuroimaging guidance for neurosurgical planning and postoperative assessment of brain metastases from the aspect of brain networks. \n\nIn the present study, both functional and structural connectivity networks exhibited a small-world topology in either healthy controls or patients with brain metastases. Small-world topology reflects a general organization principle in the human brain networks, allowing global and local parallel information processing [ , ]. This topology has been thought to sustain our normal cognitive functioning [ , ]. \n\nNevertheless, some altered topological patterns were found in patients with brain metastases compared to healthy controls: a decrease of small-worldness   σ   and normalized clustering coefficient   γ   for the structural connectivity network. The small-world network represents an optimal organization between regular and random networks [ ]. Thus, our results indicate that structural connectivity network in patients with brain metastases has a less optimal topological organization (lower   σ  ), and shifts to a more random network architecture (lower   γ  ). In a previous study based on MEG, Bartomomei et al. [ ] found that functional connectivity network showed a tendency to more random configuration in brain tumor patients. Similarly, our result of reduced normalized characteristic path length   λ   for the functional connectivity network also suggest a more random organization in patients with brain metastases. Unlike structural connectivity network, no differences were found for the small-worldness   σ   and normalized clustering coefficient   γ   in functional connectivity network between controls and patients. Structural connectivity of the adult mammalian brain can essentially keep constant for a long time without brain lesion, while functional connectivity can substantially reconfigure within a very short time [ ]. Brain metastases may lead to shift or even damage of anatomical regions or white matter tracts nearby [ ], and then directly alter the network topology of structural connectivity. However, functional connectivity could be rapidly reconfigured to response to the influence of tumor. Moreover, the reduced normalized characteristic path length   λ   could favor the speed of global information processing [ ]. Therefore, the topological alterations of functional connectivity network (a significant decrease for   λ  , but no difference for   σ   and   γ  ) may reflect a compensatory mechanism to the less optimal organization of structural connectivity network in patients with brain metastases. \n\nCombining rs-fMRI and DTI techniques, we investigated the relationship of functional and structural connectivity networks in patients with brain metastases and healthy controls. It is proved that structural connectivity is highly predictive of and places constraints on functional interactions, while functional connectivity may influence structural connectivity through brain plasticity [ ]. The relationship between functional and structural connectivity is complex, since strong functional connectivity still exists without direct structural connectivity [ ]. Thus, similar to our previous studies [ , ], we only investigated the function-structure relations on the direct (non-zero) structural connections. Previous studies have reported a reconfigured relationship of functional and structural connectivity under either physiological [ , ], or pathological states [ – ]. Consistently, we found a decreased coupling strength of functional-structural connectivity in patients with brain metastases. The finding indicates a loose relationship of functional and structural connectivity, and may reflect an abnormal mechanism of brain networks induced by brain metastases. \n\nTo assess the influence of tumor resection on functional and structural connectivity networks, a simulated procedure was performed to evaluate the network performance after removing the nodes infiltrated by brain metastases. We found a further decrease of network connectivity strength   S   for both functional and structural connectivity networks, as well as a further decrease of the small-worldness   σ   and normalized clustering coefficient   γ   for the structural connectivity network in patients after metastases removal.   S   measures the global connectivity strength in the brain networks [ ].   σ   and   γ   are important indices to evaluate whether the network is optimal for global and local parallel information processing [ , ]. Thus, our results reflect a worse network performance in patients after metastases removal, which may be attributed to the removal of some important regions like “hubs” infiltrated by metastases. Hubs are thought to be crucial for the global coordination of information flow and maintaining network integrity [ ]. Previous studies have demonstrated a more deleterious effect of hub lesions on information flow and network stability in both normal and diseased state [ , , ]. Indeed, we found a negative correlation of these altered topological properties with the number of removed hubs in patients. Our findings indicate that the more hubs are removed during metastases resection, the worse performance brain networks have, which should be paid special attention to when designing surgical plan. \n\nPrevious studies have reported negative functional connectivity in the resting state [ , ], but the mechanisms of negative functional connectivity are still less understood [ ]. To avoid uncertainty, we also computed and compared network properties of weighted functional connectivity network constructed by only positive correlation coefficients in the two groups. Interestingly, although the hubs distributions were partly different, the results of altered network properties in patients before and after metastases resection were consistent with those for the functional connectivity network constructed by absolute correlation coefficients. These findings may suggest that the topological organization of functional connectivity network is intrinsic whether considering negative functional connectivity or not. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the decreased connectivity strength   S   for both functional and structural connectivity networks were found only under AAL-90 parcellation not under AAL-1024 parcellation after metastases resection, which could be related to the number of removed hubs in patients. The percent of removed hubs under AAL-90 parcellation (≤3.3% for the functional connectivity network, ≤4.4% for the structural connectivity network) was larger than that under AAL-1024 parcellation (≤0.7% for the functional connectivity network, ≤2.5% for the structural connectivity network) in patients. According to the definition of hubs in this study, the hubs generally have large connectivity strength. Thus, the decreased connectivity strength was found under AAL-90 parcellation due to the relatively large percent of removed hubs, which could be further verified by the negative correlation of the decreased connectivity strength with the removed hubs number. Besides, the decreased small-worldness   σ   and normalized clustering coefficient   γ   for the structural connectivity network were found only using the AAL-1024 scheme not using the AAL-90 scheme in patients before and after metastases removal. The “small-world” parameters (e.g. small-worldness and clustering coefficient) have been demonstrated to vary largely in value under different parcellation scales [ ]. Therefore, our findings indicate that finer parcellation scale could be more sensitive to capture alternations of network organization, and network analyses on different parcellation scales can provide more comprehensive information in disease state. \n\nThere are some limitations in the current study. First, the sample size of patients was relatively small. Even so, some statistically significant alterations of brain networks were detected. It should be noted that these preliminary findings need to be verified in a large sample size in future study. Second, there was a low overlap of metastases locations in our relatively small sample size. Subgroup analyses based on tumor locations in a large sample size may provide more specific guidance for neurosurgical planning and postoperative assessment of brain metastases. Third, there exists biased sex proportion (thirteen males vs. one female) in patients with brain metastases. Previous studies have reported the effect of sex differences on functional and structural connectivity networks [ , – ]. Although no statistically significant difference was found in sex between controls and patients, there should be some reservation about the extent to which our findings can be generalized to patients with brain metastases as a whole. Finally, we assessed the influence of tumor resection on brain networks by a simulated tumor (node) removal. However, it is difficult to know the real changes of brain networks, especially functional connectivity networks, resulting from tumor resection only by a simple node removal method. Recently, Wang et al. [ ] proposed a critical dynamical model method and successfully simulated functional connectivity matrices from structural connectivity matrices, which may provide a new idea to simulate changes of functional connectivity networks after node removal. Overall, the current results need to be verified by using postoperative neuroimaging data in future work. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis study for the first time assessed the effect of brain metastases on both functional and structural connectivity networks using graph theoretical analysis. Patients with brain metastases showed an altered topological organization as well as a decreased coupling strength of functional and structural connectivity networks. Moreover, the removal of metastases aggravated disruptions of functional and structural connectivity networks in patients, and the alterations of network properties correlated with the removed hubs number. Overall, our results indicate that brain metastases interfere with the optimal network organization and relationship of functional and structural connectivity networks, and the hubs removal could lead to a worse performance of brain networks. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"7c30483e515709212bb2256ad8d84aae"},

This study aimed to detect alterations of static functional network connectivity (FNC) and dynamic FNC in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and to estimate the association between the altered FNC and clinical features related to HFpEF. \n\n\n## Methods and results \n  \nThe clinical and resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of HFpEF patients (  n   = 35) and healthy controls (HCs) (  n   = 35) were acquired at baseline.

The associations between the FNC abnormalities and clinical features related to HFpEF were analysed. Compared with HCs, HFpEF patients showed decreased functional connectivity within the default mode network, left frontoparietal network, and right frontoparietal network and increased functional connectivity within the right frontoparietal network and visual network. Negative correlations were observed between decreased dynamic FNC and the left ventricular end‐diastolic diameter (LVDd) (  r   = −0.435,   P   = 0.015) as well as the left ventricular end‐systolic diameter (LVDs) (  r   = −0.443,   P   = 0.013). \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe FNC disruption and altered temporal properties of functional dynamics in HFpEF patients may reflect the neural mechanisms of brain injury after HFpEF, which may deepen our understanding of the disease. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHeart failure (HF) is a rising global epidemic disease with relatively high mortality. Three main phenotypes describe HF according to measurement of the left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF): HF with reduced EF (HFrEF), HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), and HF with mid‐range EF. Almost half of HF patients are HFpEF, and the prevalence is increasing.  Cognitive decline in executive function, attention, episodic memory, language, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial ability is typical for patients with HF, with differences between HFrEF and HFpEF.  Neuroimaging research indicates that HF patients exhibit a diverse range of brain structural alterations and then lead to cognitive impairment. ,  ,   Frey   et al  . recently found that reduced hippocampal volume observed at baseline was associated with impaired cognitive function in patients with predominantly mild HF.  It is essential to determine the aberrant functional connectivity (FC) in HFpEF for understanding the ongoing injurious processes, which would help guide intervention strategies for neural protection in the condition. \n\nNon‐invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures have been implemented to evaluate brain alterations associated with HF. Recent works have shown alterations in several brain regions serving automatic, sensorimotor, mood, and cognition, including medial temporal lobes, cingulate gyrus, mammillary bodies, and fornix thalamus. ,  ,   Park   et al  . found that the topology of functional integration and specialized characteristics in HF are significantly changed in regions showing altered FC, an outcome that would interfere with brain network organization.  These prove that impaired resting‐state functional organization may lead to temporal neuropsychologic and physiologic pathology in HF and may exacerbate the potential for further injury. However, the inter‐network interactions in patients with HFpEF remain unclear in HF. In view of the ability to isolate various brain function networks, the independent component analysis (ICA) has been widely applied for identifying resting‐state networks (RSNs) to define different remote interaction patterns. ,   Meanwhile, the functional network connectivity (FNC) can represent the temporal correlation between these RSNs.  Therefore, exploration of the RSNs and FNC may provide unique dysconnectivity information to understand the underlying neural mechanisms in patients with HFpEF. \n\nIn this study, we aimed to evaluate the whole brain network connectivity in patients with HFpEF using static FNC (sFNC) and dynamic FNC (dFNC) based on resting‐state functional MRI (fMRI). Moreover, the associations between the altered FNC and clinical features related to HFpEF were analysed. This study will enable us to understand how HFpEF influences brain function connectivity change and provide some evidences of the neural mechanisms of brain injury after HFpEF. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects and clinical data \n  \nThirty‐five patients with HFpEF and 35 age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) matched healthy controls (HCs) were prospectively enrolled between January 2016 and October 2019. HFpEF was diagnosed according to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for HF 2016.  First, the patient should have symptoms and signs typical of HF. Second, echocardiography should show normal or only slightly reduced LVEF (reduced LVEF is defined as <50%). Finally, structural heart disease, such as LV hypertrophy and enlargement of the left atrium (LA), or direct and indirect measures of diastolic LV dysfunction, such as elevated E/e′ or low e′ or tricuspid regurgitation velocity, should be used.  The patients were excluded if they met the following criteria: (i) diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension, significant valvular disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization; (ii) previous cardiac surgery; and (iii) estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min. Besides, age and sex matched HCs were also recruited and met the following inclusion criteria: (i) without a history of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidaemia; (ii) had normal exercise capacity by cardiopulmonary exercise testing; (iii) not on any medications; (iv) normal resting echocardiograms and electrocardiograms; and (v) underwent the same neuroimaging tests as HFpEF patients. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nanjing Medical University. All participants provided written informed consent before undergoing MRI. \n\nThe demographic characteristics, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and relevant medical history were collected. Fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein, and high‐density lipoprotein were derived from laboratory blood tests. LVEF, fractional shortening (FS), left ventricular end‐diastolic diameter (LVDd), and left ventricular end‐systolic diameter (LVDs) were derived from echocardiography. Diastolic dysfunction was assessed by the ratio of early diastolic mitral flow velocity and early diastolic myocardial velocity (E/Em ratio). LV mass was calculated by area‐length method and indexed to body surface area (LVMI). \n\n\n### Cognitive function assessment \n  \nMini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE)  and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)  were used to evaluate the neurocognitive state of all participants. MMSE was conducted prior to MoCA for each participant. Similar sections on ‘Orientation’ and ‘Serial subtraction starting at 100’ in both tests were tested only once and scored based on their response to the task in MMSE to avoid familiarization. The subjects with scores of ≥25 for MMSE or ≥26 were considered cognitively normal, and lower scores indicated poorer cognitive abilities. \n\n\n### Imaging procedure \n  \n#### Functional magnetic resonance imaging scan parameters \n  \nAll participants completed fMRI scan on a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner (Ingenia, Philips Medical Systems) using an eight‐channel digital head coil receiver and parallel imaging technology. T1‐weighted images of the whole brain were acquired for each subject with a three‐dimensional turbo fast echo (3D‐TFE) sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR): 8.1 ms; echo time (TE): 3.7 ms; slices: 170; thickness: 1 mm; gap: 0 mm; acquisition matrix: 256 × 256; flip angle (FA): 8°; and field of view (FOV): 256 mm × 256 mm. The structural sequence took 5 min and 28 s. The resting‐state‐fMRI (rs‐fMRI) blood oxygen level‐dependent (BOLD) scans were acquired axially using a gradient echo‐planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: TR: 2000 ms; TE: 30 ms; slices: 36; gap: 0 mm; thickness: 4 mm; FOV: 240 mm × 240 mm; FA: 90°; and acquisition matrix: 64 × 64. The rs‐fMRI sequence scan took 8 min and 6 s. During all resting‐state scans, scanner noise and head motion were reduced by using earplugs and foam padding, and the participants were instructed to close their eyes and rest peacefully. \n\n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nData preprocessing was carried out using GRETNA software ( ) implemented in MATLAB (Version R2013b), which included the following: (i) data format conversion (DICOM data transformed into NIFI format); (ii) removal of volumes (the first 10 volumes were removed from each time series); (iii) slice‐timing correction; (iv) realignment (head movement >2.0 mm translation or >2.0° rotation were excluded); (v) spatial normalization (warping individual T1 image to standard MNI space ); and (vi) spatial smoothing (a Gaussian smoothing kernel). \n\n\n### Resting‐state networks selection and analysis \n  \nAfter data preprocessing, resting‐state data of all participants were analysed using spatial ICA as implemented in the GIFT software ( ) to select RSNs. The number of independent components (ICs) was determined by using the minimum description length (MDL) criteria.  First, a set of spatial ICA was executed on the aggregate data of the participants, resulting in an estimate of the ICs.  Then, the strength value of connectivity within each IC was converted into a   z  ‐score to reflect the degree of correlation between the time series of a given voxel and the average time series of its corresponding components. Among the 34 components resulting from ICA, six significant components were identified as RSNs through visual observation based on previous studies. These ICs were classified into six RSNs (  Figure  ): attention network (AN), default mode network (DMN), left frontoparietal network (LFPN), right frontoparietal network (RFPN), sensorimotor network (SMN), and visual network (VN), which have been widely reported in previous resting‐state fMRI research. ,   For each RSN, the single‐sample   t  ‐test was first used to obtain the   z  ‐maps for each group, the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct, and the statistical figure was obtained at the threshold of   P   < 0.01. Then, the two‐sample   t  ‐test was used to compare the voxels within a union mask on the   z  ‐maps of the RSNs between‐group. Between‐group effects were thresholded at   P   < 0.01, corrected by FDR correction. \n  \nFunctional relevant resting‐state networks (RSNs). The spatial maps of six independent components (ICs) were selected as the RSNs for further analysis. AN, attention network; DMN, default mode network; LFPN, left frontoparietal network; RFPN, right frontoparietal network; SMN, sensorimotor network; VN, visual network. \n  \n\n### Static functional network connectivity analysis between resting‐state networks \n  \nFirst, a time‐domain band‐pass filter (band‐pass 0.00–0.25 Hz) was used to reduce the influence of low‐frequency drift and high‐frequency physiological noise on the time process. Pearson correlation between any two RSN time processes for each participant was calculated to generate an FNC correlation matrix with the dimensions of 6 (ICs) × 6. In the general linear model, FNC group difference estimation was performed for each pair of RSNs. The significance threshold was   P   < 0.05; FDR was used to correct for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n### Dynamic functional network connectivity analysis between resting‐state networks \n  \nThe temporal dFNC toolbox within the GIFT software was used for the analysis. The dFNC between ICA time courses was computed based on a sliding time‐window approach.  We used a tapered window created by convolving a rectangle (width = 30 s, 15 TRs) with a Gaussian (σ = 3 TRs) and advancing 1 TR at each step.  A   k  ‐means algorithm with the squared Euclidean distance, 500 iterates, and 150 replicates dFNC windows were partitioned into four clusters.  The number of states was determined using the elbow criterion (the ratio of within‐cluster distance to between‐clusters distances). The connectivity pattern of each subject for each state was estimated as a subject median of the subject windows that were assigned to this state. Using subject state vectors, we also computed the percentage of occurrence of each dFNC state for each subject. The group difference was computed using two‐sample   t  ‐tests at each state and results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the FDR (  P   < 0.05). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristic were analysed using commercially available software (SPSS for Windows, Version 19.0; SPSS). Continuous data are shown as the mean ± SD, whereas categorical variables are presented as absolute and relative frequencies. The differences between HFpEF patients and HCs were assessed using the   χ   test for categorical variables and an independent‐samples   t  ‐test or Fisher's exact test for continuous variables.   P   < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. For FNC analysis, group comparisons between HFpEF and HC groups were performed using two‐sample   t  ‐tests. Pearson's correlation coefficients between dFNC values and echocardiographic parameters, dFNC values, and cognitive scores were analysed with a significance level of   P   < 0.05. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Participants and clinical data \n  \nAmong 70 participants in the study, four patients were excluded due to excessive head motion artefacts after the fMRI data head motion check. Thirty‐one HFpEF patients [17 men and 14 women; mean age (years ± SD) 59.39 ± 6.51; range, 47–69] and 35 subjects [22 men and 13 women; mean age (years ± SD) 56.77 ± 6.25; range, 43–70] were analysed. The education, MMSE scores, and MoCA scores were not significantly different between HFpEF groups and HC groups. The high‐density lipoprotein in HFpEF groups was significantly lower than that in HC groups (1.06 ± 0.23, 1.34 ± 0.42;   t   = 3.205,   P   = 0.002); the other laboratory blood tests (fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein, SBP, and DBP) were not significantly different in two groups. Echocardiography examination was performed in patients with HFpEF. In HFpEF group, LVEF was (61.19 ± 5.33)%; FS was (33.48 ± 3.36)%; LVDd was (47.48 ± 4.36) mm; and LVDs was (30.97 ± 3.89) mm (  Table  ). There were no significant differences of echocardiography information between HFpEF group and HCs. The HFpEF patients had higher E/Em ratio and LVMI than the HCs (  Table  ). \n  \nDemographic clinical characteristic in patients with HFpEF and HCs \n    \n\n### Independent component analysis and component selection \n  \nA total of 34 ICs were extracted by ICA, among which 6 components were selected as the RSNs for further analysis. Six networks with these components were labelled as follows (  Figure  ): The attention network (AN) (IC27) mainly included the dorsal anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortices, as well as part of the prefrontal areas. The default mode network (DMN) (IC2) included the posterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal, and medial prefrontal cortex nodes. The left frontoparietal network (LFPN) (IC13) included the inferior parietal lobule, superior parietal lobule, and temporal lobule. The right frontoparietal network (RFPN) (IC28) included the left middle frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, superior parietal lobule, and angular gyrus. The sensorimotor network (SMN) (IC14) was mainly focused at the bilateral primary somatosensory cortex, including precentral and postcentral gyri areas. The visual network (VN) (IC34) included the primary visual cortex [the bilateral calcarine sulcus and medial extra‐striate region (e.g. the lingual gyrus and cuneus)]. \n\n\n### Group functional connectivity differences within resting‐state networks \n  \nThe FC analysis showed four RSNs had significant differences between HFpEF and HC groups, including the DMN, LFPN, RFPN, and VN (  Table   and   Figure  ). Compared with the HC group, the HFpEF group exhibited decreased FC within the DMN (right inferior frontal operculum), LFPN (left superior frontal lobe), and RFPN (right medial superior frontal lobe and right middle frontal lobe). Moreover, there was increased FC in the RFPN (left superior frontal lobe) and VN (right superior occipital lobe) in the HFpEF group compared with the HC group. Based on voxel‐wise analysis, the resting‐state FC did not show significant alteration in AN and SMN. \n  \nBrain regions with significant differences connectivity within resting‐state networks between heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients and healthy controls \n      \nGroup functional connectivity (FC) differences within resting‐state networks (RSNs).

Relative to the HC group, the HFpEF group exhibited significantly decreased negative network interactions between DMN and AN. \n\n\n### Group differences in dynamic functional network connectivity \n  \nTime‐varying FNC over the scan duration can be represented by five states. FNC states are characterized by the cluster centroids (Supporting Information,   Figure  ). Significant differences between groups in dFNC were observed only in State 3 (16% dFNC) (Supporting Information,   Figure  ). Clustering results with   k   = 5 are shown in   Figure  . Reoccurrence fraction in State 3 (0.08 ± 0.09 vs. 0.23 ± 0.17) and mean dwell time in State 3 (7.32 ± 5.91 vs. 13.78 ± 9.34) in HFpEF group were significantly shorter than those in HC group (  t   = 4.329,   P   < 0.001;   t   = 3.305,   P   = 0.002) (  Figure  ) (Supporting Information,   Table  ). Group differences in dFNC using the window width of 40, 50, and 60 s corresponding to 20 TRs, 25 TRs, and 30 TRs, respectively, were also shown in the Supporting Information,   Figures  . \n  \n(A) Mean dwell time in windows vs. cluster states between HC and HFpEF; (B) reoccurrence fraction in State 3 and (C) mean dwell time in State 3 between HC and HFpEF were plotted using violin plots.

The significant negative correlations were found between reoccurrence fraction in State 3 and LVDd (  r   = −0.435,   P   = 0.015) (  Figure  ) and reoccurrence fraction in State 3 and LVDs (  r   = −0.443,   P   = 0.013) (  Figure  ). In addition, a significant negative correlation was found between the mean dwell time in State 3 and LVDd (  r   = −0.403,   P   = 0.025) (  Figure  ). However, we did not find any significant correlations between the dFNC values and the E/Em ratio and LVMI (  P   > 0.05). Moreover, there were no significant correlations between dFNC values and cognitive scores. \n  \n(A) The significant negative correlations were found between reoccurrence fraction in State 3 and LVDd (  r   = −0.435,   P   = 0.015), (B) reoccurrence fraction in State 3 and LVDs (  r   = −0.443,   P   = 0.013), and (C) mean dwell time in State 3 and LVDd (  r   = −0.403,   P   = 0.025).

Others studies have also reported that patients with HF have brain changes related to cognitive function. ,   However, the samples of these studies were heterogeneity. It is unclear whether the subtypes of HF (HFpEF) will cause brain changes. In our study, we found decreased FC within LFPN, RFPN, and DMN and increased FC within RFPN and VN in HFpEF. Park   et al  . demonstrated that HF patients had aberrant spontaneous functional connections in various brain areas using rs‐fMRI, which were related to sensorimotor, autonomic, mood, and cognitive regulation.  DMN is widely known to be associated with cognitive and emotional processing,  and FPN is critical for the ability to coordinate behaviour in a rapid, accurate, and flexible goal‐driven manner. \n\nHeart failure patients had tissue injury in most of brain regions (including hippocampus, anterior thalamus, fornix, mammillary bodies, caudate nuclei, putamen, cerebellum, and frontal cortices) that regulate cognitive, behavioural, and planning functions.  In this study, we found that the decreased FC was mainly in right inferior frontal operculum, left superior frontal lobe, right medial superior frontal lobe, and right middle frontal lobe in patients with HFpEF. The frontal lobes have progressively acquired a central role in most aspects of cognition and behaviour. In addition, the RFPN (left superior frontal lobe) and VN (right superior occipital lobe) showed increase in patients with HFpEF. The FPN is pivotal in visual–spatial attention and motor function. The VN is associated with the processing of visual information. Given all this, the results of the increased RFPN and VN may suggest a compensatory mechanism to lessen the consequences of nerve damage caused by DMN and FPN and help maintain the patient's cognitive abilities. \n\nIt is worth pointing out that the HFpEF group exhibited significantly decreased negative interactions between DMN and AN, which was an important finding that had not been previously reported in HFpEF. The DMN is responsible for control and integration of primary perception and advanced cognition.  The decline in attention and reduction in volume of the attention‐related cortex reflects the impaired function of AN.  Athilingam   et al  . showed that HFpEF patients had delayed recall and reduced abstraction abilities scored by MoCA.  Therefore, we believed that the changes in the interactions between DMN and AN may provide further information on how HFpEF patients can adjust the connectivity of the related networks during cognitive tests. \n\nThe dFNC could capture uncontrolled but reoccurring patterns of interactions among intrinsic networks during task engagement or at rest, which has not been explored in HFpEF patients. The five reoccurring dFNC states, significantly different from static connectivity, suggest the human brain is highly dynamic.  Our results showed that HFpEF patients demonstrated shorter time in State 3, including the reoccurrence fraction and dwell time, which had negative correlations with LVDd and LVDs. The mechanism proposed for brain injury in HF is multifactorial. The cerebral blood flow, the neurohormonal axis, and the inflammatory axis in HF were thought to have a role in the interaction between HF, cognition, and structural brain changes.  A possible explanation of our results might be found in the complex interaction between the LVDd and LVDs in the HFpEF patients and its effect on the reoccurrence fraction and mean dwell time in State 3. The correspondence between changes in LVDd and LVDs and changes in dFNC suggest that variability in the reoccurrence fraction and mean dwell time in State 3 may contribute from fluctuations in autonomic tone and their potential psychological correlates. In addition, the window size from 30 s to 1 min had relatively little impact on dynamics. \n\nThere are several limitations and shortcomings in the present work that have to be considered. First, this is a preliminary cross‐sectional study of FNC changes in HFpEF with limited sample size, so that it is difficult to direct the casual relationship between brain functional network and HFpEF. More longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed. Second, other brain networks may play an important role in the pathophysiology of brain injury in HFpEF, and detecting the variation of the FC and FNC in multiple networks will provide insight into the neural mechanism in depth. Finally, the ICA method cannot reveal the directionality of the interactions between networks. Further studies are required to assess the specific and directional function in coupling with other brain networks in HFpEF. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nTo summarize, this is the first study to assess function connectivity and the FNC properties in HFpEF. Our findings demonstrated that decreased negative network interactions between DMN and AN in sFNC and shorter dwelling time and reoccurrence fraction in dFNC and decreased dwelling time and reoccurrence fraction in dFNC were associated with LVDd and LVDs in HFpEF. We believe these findings could potentially help our understanding of the neural mechanisms of brain injury after HFpEF. \n\n\n## Conflict of interest \n  \nThe authors declare that there is no potential conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nNone. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"df15c266f511279c9d39add5dcfe6a28"},

To better characterize this cognitive subtype of PTSD, this study investigated (1) alterations in specific FPCN and LN subnetworks and (2) chronicity of PTSD symptoms. In a post-9/11 veteran sample (  N   = 368, 89% male), we identified EF subgroups using a standardized neuropsychological battery and a priori cutoffs for impaired, average, and above-average EF performance. Functional connectivity between two subnetworks of the FPCN and three subnetworks of the LN was assessed using resting-state fMRI (  n   = 314). PTSD chronicity over a 1–2-year period was assessed using a reliable change index (  n   = 175). The impaired EF-PTSD subtype had significantly reduced negative functional connectivity between the FPCN subnetwork involved in top-down control of emotion and two LN subnetworks involved in learning/memory and social/emotional processing. This impaired EF-PTSD subtype had relatively chronic PTSD, while those with above-average EF and PTSD displayed greater symptom reduction. Lastly, FPCN-LN subnetworks partially mediated the relationship between EF and PTSD chronicity (  n   = 121). This study reveals (1) that an impaired EF-PTSD subtype has a specific pattern of FPCN-LN subnetwork connectivity, (2) a novel above-average EF-PTSD subtype displays reduced PTSD chronicity, and (3) both cognitive and neural functioning predict PTSD chronicity. The results indicate a need to investigate how individuals with this impaired EF-PTSD subtype respond to treatment, and how they might benefit from personalized and novel approaches that target these neurocognitive systems. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHeterogeneity in PTSD’s symptom presentation, neurobiology, treatment efficacy, and longitudinal course has impeded progress in preventing and treating this disorder. To address this issue, researchers have begun to identify potential subtypes of PTSD, based on a range of clinical, behavioral, and biological indicators, that may help explain this heterogeneity. One approach to understanding subtypes of PTSD has been through the examination of cognition, as cognitive impairments in memory, attention, and executive functioning may underlie a number of fundamental aspects of the disorder. Recent work has suggested that cognitive subtypes of PTSD, or PTSD with specific patterns of cognitive dysfunction, have unique clinical characteristics, longitudinal clinical trajectories, and treatment efficacy [ – ]. \n\nWe recently found evidence for a cognitive subtype of PTSD with impaired executive functioning. Initially, in a large sample of post-9/11 veterans, we found that PTSD was associated with reduced negative resting-state connectivity between the frontal parietal control network (FPCN) and limbic network (LN) [ ]. The FPCN is thought to support executive functions (EF) like goal maintenance, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control, whereas the LN is important for processing and learning emotional and threatening information [ ]. Aberrations in this FPCN-LN circuitry are commonly observed in PTSD and are a core feature of many neurobiological models of PTSD [ ,  ] (e.g., EF and emotional regulation models [ ,  ]). Critically, we identified that this connectivity marker was most prominent   specifically   in those with both PTSD and clinically significant impairments in EF. Thus, we identified an impaired EF-PTSD subtype with a specific neural signature (aberrant FPCN-LN connectivity). \n\nDespite this discovery, the potential translational utility of this impaired EF-PTSD subtype remains unclear, including its implications in the development and longitudinal course of PTSD, as well as treatment response. However, previous work suggests that executive functioning impairments and FPCN/LN dysfunction may increase risk for developing PTSD [ – ], contribute to the maintenance of PTSD [ ], and reduce treatment efficacy [ – ]. Thus, in the current study, we hypothesized that the impaired EF-PTSD subtype would have a more chronic longitudinal course of PTSD over a 1–2-year period, compared to individuals with PTSD but no EF impairment. \n\nA limitation of the study that characterized this impaired EF-PTSD subtype was the use of a relatively coarse network parcellation. Recent literature indicates that large-scale networks such as the FPCN and LN consist of reliable and functionally distinct subnetworks that exhibit unique connectivity patterns [ – ]. For instance, several studies have identified that the FPCN subnetwork (FPCN ) exhibits increased connectivity with the dorsal attention network. In contrast, a second FPCN subnetwork (FPCN ) exhibits increased connectivity with the default mode network [ ]. These subnetworks are thought to contribute differentially to executive functioning; the FPCN  predominantly supports executive control of externally-focused attention, whereas the FPCN  predominantly supports executive control of internally-focused attention and emotion [ ]. Similarly, different limbic subnetworks may be functionally distinct [ – ]. Thus, investigating how these subnetworks differ in the EF-subtype of PTSD could help isolate the neurocognitive dysfunction in these individuals and suggest refined targets for interventions. \n\nIn the current study, we examined neurobiological and longitudinal evidence for an impaired EF subtype of PTSD. First, we examined whether this impaired EF-PTSD subtype had unique connectivity signatures between subnetworks of the FPCN and LN. Second, we examined if this impaired EF-PTSD subtype, and its corresponding neural marker(s), were predictive of the longitudinal course of PTSD symptoms. We also explored if this subtype of PTSD had differentiable comorbidities and cognitive functioning in other related domains (e.g., attention, memory, and the Gradual Onset Continuous Performance Task [gradCPT; a computer-based measure of inhibitory control]).Together, determining if this impaired EF-PTSD subtype has specific brain markers (i.e., subnetworks) and greater symptom chronicity would substantiate its clinical relevance, help explain heterogeneity in PTSD, and point toward personalized interventions. \n\n\n## Methods and materials \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were 368 post-9/11 veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn that met the following criterion. All participants took part in the Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) study, had verified clinical and cognitive data at baseline that passed performance validity testing (see  : Assessment of PTSD, comorbidities, and demographics;  : Performance Validity), participated in an MRI scan at baseline (  n   = 314), participated in a 1–2 year follow-up assessment (  n   = 175; chronicity analyses restricted those with PTSD diagnosis at baseline), or both scanning and longitudinal assessment (  n   = 121; Fig.  ). Details regarding recruitment, exclusion criterion, and assessments are described in a recent publication [ ]. The sample for this study is not independent of our prior study [ ], but includes an additional 97 participants. This study is thus an extension of our previous work, investigating chronicity of PTSD symptoms in those with longitudinal data, as well as subnetwork connectivity in the larger sample. All research procedures were approved by the IRB of Human Studies Research at the VA Boston Healthcare System. Participants provided informed consent and were compensated for their participation.    Participants.  \nThe participants available at the start of the study were collected in TRACTS between 2010 and 2017. The current study includes the first 368 participants with verified clinical data, cognitive data, who passed a performance validity test and had either neuroimaging or longitudinal clinical data. Of these 368 participants, 314 had verified resting-state fMRI and anatomical neuroimaging (181 meeting criteria for PTSD). 175 participants with PTSD had a follow-up clinical assessment, and 121 of these participants had both baseline neuroimaging and a follow-up clinical assessment. Scanner 1 was a 3 T Siemens TIM Trio scanner using a 12-channel head coil, Scanner 2 was a 3 T Siemens MAGNETOM PrismaFit scanner using a 20-channel head coil. \n  \n\n\n### Assessment of PTSD, comorbidities, and demographics \n  \nThe Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS-IV [ ]) was administered to diagnose PTSD and assess symptom severity. Primary analyses considered PTSD diagnosis, however, overall symptom severity and symptoms clusters, and other clinical comorbidities and demographic variables were considered in the Supplemental Results: Follow-up regression models. \n\n\n### Assessment of executive functioning \n  \nEF subgroups were defined in an a priori manner using a previously validated procedure that employs a battery of six neuropsychological tests with five measures examining EF (see Table  ). Using DSM-5 criteria for mild neurocognitive impairment, impaired EF was defined as performance falling greater than one standard deviation below normative expectations on two or more neuropsychological measures of EF. In addition, we used a parallel approach to identify individuals with above-average EF as evidenced by performing at greater than one standard deviation above normative expectations on two or more neuropsychological measures [ ]. All other participants scoring between these cutoff ranges were considered to have average EF. We used these previously published and normative-based cutoffs to characterize clinically significant differences in EF and increase reliability [ ,  ,  ]. In addition, a continuous measure of EF was assessed with a composite mean z-score across all five measures. \n\n\n### Additional cognitive measures \n  \nWe examined composite measures (z-scores) of attention and verbal memory to determine the specificity of the impaired EF-PTSD subtype to EF (see  : Attention and Memory Cognitive Composites; Table  ). In addition, in a subset of participants (  n   = 107), we examined performance on a computer-based cognitive assessment of sustained attention and inhibitory control known as the Gradual Onset Continuous Performance Task (gradCPT). The gradCPT is a well validated, reliable go/no-go continuous performance task [ – ]. We examined gradCPT as an independent, but mechanistically related EF measure that has been associated with PTSD is several studies [ – ]. The gradCPT has two primary measures of task ability [ ]: accuracy and reaction time variability (see  : gradCPT). \n\n\n### Neuroimaging methods \n  \n#### Acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nAnatomical and 12 min of resting-state fMRI were acquired with a 3 T Siemens TIM Trio scanner, using a 12-channel head coil (  n   = 261) or a 3 T Siemens MAGNETOM PrismaFit scanner using a 20-channel head coil (  n   = 53). See Fig.   and the  : MRI Acquisition for more details on scanning parameters. Scanner differences were considered as covariates in neuroimaging analyses. Preprocessing protocols matched our prior publication [ ]. Details regarding preprocessing and quality control are found in the  : Image Processing. \n\n\n#### Brain parcellation and functional connectivity \n  \nIn the current study, we used a standardized cortical 17 network parcellation [ ] with 200 regions of interest (or parcels). Based on our previous study [ ], the current study focused on the connectivity between the FPCN and LN by selecting the two FPCN subnetworks (FPCN  and FPCN ) and two LN subnetworks (LN , LN ) from this cortical atlas. An additional network (LN-medial temporal; LN ) included four medial temporal brain regions (bilateral amygdala and hippocampus) [ ], used in our previous studies [ ,  ,  ], as these structures are commonly implicated in neurobiological models of PTSD (Fig.  ). Following preprocessing ( : Brain Parcellation), average time series were extracted from each network (averaged across voxels in each parcel and then parcels within each network) and correlated (Pearson) with their respective between-network pairs (e.g., LN  correlated with FPCN ) for a total of six between-network correlations. The connectivity (correlation) values were Fisher transformed prior to running group-level statistics.

Of these, we focused the following analyses on the 175 with a PTSD diagnosis at baseline, in order to assess chronicity of PTSD. With this additional assessment, we calculated a reliable change index to measure the chronicity of PTSD symptoms. The reliable change index is a continuous regression-based change measure developed by McSweeny et al. [ ], and subsequently updated by Hilton-Bayer [ ]. This method, unlike a simple subtraction-based measure, adjusts for regression to the mean, test-retest reliability, and inequality of variance. First, the total CAPS score at follow-up was adjusted for the total CAPS at baseline (residual change), while also adjusting for test-retest reliability of CAPS-IV [ ] (see  : Reliable Change Index). Since there was a wide range of time between baseline and follow-up assessments, we included time between baseline and follow-up as a covariate in the reliable change index analysis. This analysis controlled for any systematic differences of time between baseline and follow-up on chronicity of PTSD symptoms (e.g., those with more chronic PTSD could have shorter time between baseline and follow-up). In a subset of these participants (  n   = 91), we were able to examine medical records between baseline and follow-up to identify those who had sought treatment for PTSD. Treatment was investigated as a potential covariate in reliable change index analyses (see  : Treatment). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \n#### Clinical, cognitive, demographic differences between EF subgroups \n  \nUsing the full sample (  n   = 368, Fig.  ), we examined if EF subgroups (impaired, average, and above average) differed in clinical symptoms, cognitive measures (in addition to EF), and demographics. To do this, we conducted linear regressions treating EF subgroups ordinally, predicting: age, gender identity, education, verbal ability, CAPS symptom clusters, mild TBI, alcohol use, anxiety, depression, sleep, pain, attention, and memory. In subsequent EF subgroup analyses (fMRI, chronicity), we considered factors that significantly differed across EF subgroups as potential covariates, to isolate the unique predictive power of EF (above and beyond these additional clinical, cognitive, and demographic correlates of EF), as well as other relevant confounds that could be related to functional connectivity (i.e., scanner, head motion) or reliable change (i.e., time between baseline and follow-up, treatment-seeking). These covariates were considered in separate analyses by isolating the effect of EF by category of covariates (e.g., demographics, clinical measures, or cognition). See  : Follow-up Regression Models and Table  . \n\n\n#### Subnetwork connectivity differences between EF subgroups of PTSD \n  \nWe used six multiple linear regression models to determine if the impaired EF-PTSD subtype had a unique connectivity profile in one or more of the FPCN-LN subnetwork connections (  n   = 314, see Fig.  ). A significant interaction between PTSD diagnosis and EF subgroups (treated ordinally) predicting connectivity between FPCN (A and B) and LN (A, B, and MT) subnetworks would indicate that the combination of EF and PTSD, above and beyond the main effects of each, uniquely predicts subnetwork connectivity. A significant interaction would extend our previous work which found that PTSD alongside EF impairments was associated with whole-network FPCN-LN dysconnectivity in a smaller sample using a more course (7 networks) brain parcellation. The six interactions were investigated with and without specific categories of covariates (e.g., demographics, clinical, cognitive, scanner, head motion, and treatment [See  : Follow-up Regression Models and Table  ]). We followed up on significant interactions by investigating the relationship between EF and connectivity in those with and without PTSD, separately. \n\n\n#### PTSD chronicity differences across EF subgroups of PTSD \n  \nWe used linear regression to test whether EF subgroups (treated ordinally) predicted chronicity of PTSD symptoms (i.e., RCI), in those with a PTSD diagnosis at baseline (  n   = 175, see Fig.  ). This main effect was tested with and without covariates. Exploratory analyses considered whether the inclusion of FPCN-LN subnetwork connectivity improved prediction of the reliable change index and potentially mediated the effect of EF on PTSD chronicity (  n   = 121, see Fig.   for sample information). We conducted a mediation analysis using the Preacher and Hayes Method [ ] and the Mediation package in R. First, we assessed if EF remained a significant predictor of chronicity in this smaller sample (  n   = 121), followed by determining if functional connectivity predicted chronicity while controlling for EF. Lastly, we calculated the indirect effect connectivity had on chronicity while calculating confidence intervals using a bootstrapping procedure [ ]. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical, cognitive, demographic differences between EF subgroups \n  \nEF subgroups differed in verbal abilities, total CAPS score (especially hyperarousal symptoms), alcohol use, sleep dysfunction, attention, and memory (  p   values < 0.038, see Table  ). Therefore, in our subsequent analyses examining whether the impaired EF-PTSD subtype had unique subnetwork connectivity, we considered these significant demographic, clinical, and cognitive measures as separate categories of covariates to ensure these brain signatures were unique to PTSD and EF (See  : Follow-up Regression Models, Table  ). These covariates were considered in our chronicity analysis (except for baseline PTSD symptoms which were already used to residualize the reliable change index [RCI], see Methods), determining if prediction of PTSD-chronicity was unique to EF and not driven by these related factors. We did not explicitly test for proportional differences in EF subgroups related to race. This is because there were proportionally few American Indian, Asian, Black, and Pacific Islander participants relative to White participants, limiting the statistical power to detect meaningful differences. However, the racial distribution across the subgroups are reported in Table  .   \nSample characteristics. \n  \n β   and   p   values are from regression analyses in which EF groups predicted demographics, clinical, and cognitive measures. Significant effects are bolded, and these were included as covariates in follow-up functional connectivity and chronicity analyses.

Both primary measures from the gradCPT (accuracy and reaction time variability) were significantly predicted by EF subgroups, indicating clinically significant differences in EF based on neuropsychological measures are also associated with these related cognitive processes (  p   values < 0.01; see  : gradCPT). This substantiates our EF groups using an independent measure of EF (i.e., inhibitory control). \n\n\n### Subnetwork connectivity differences between EF subgroups of PTSD \n  \nWe determined if the impaired EF-PTSD subtype had a unique FPCN-LN connectivity profile using six multiple linear regression models examining the main effects and interaction between PTSD diagnosis and EF subgroups predicting connectivity between FPCN (A, and B) and LN (A, B, and MT) subnetworks. We observed significant PTSD by EF interactions for FPCN -LN  connectivity (  β   = −0.59,   p   = 0.006,   FDR-q   = 0.018) and FPCN -LN  connectivity (  β   = −0.55,   p   = 0.010;   FDR-q   = 0.021, see Table   and Fig.  ), but not for the other FPCN-LN subnetworks (  p   values > 0.520; see Table  ). For both the FPCN -LN  and FPCN -LN  connectivity, the significant interaction indicated reductions in negative connectivity with more impaired EF, but only for those with PTSD. These interactions remained significant after controlling for demographic, clinical, and cognitive covariate categories identified in the previous analysis (  p   values < 0.05; see Table  ) and differences in scanner parameters and head motion (  p   values < 0.012 see Table  ). These interactions also remained significant across various network parcellation sizes (  p   values < 0.016; 300–1000 parcels; see   and Table  ). We also investigated the interaction between EF and CAPS symptom clusters to determine if this effect was specific to re-experiencing, avoidance, or hyperarousal. This analysis revealed no evidence for specificity to any one symptom cluster (see   and Table  ). In sum, the PTSD by EF interaction uniquely predicted FPCN -LN  and FPCN -LN  connectivity when accounting for a number of covariates including, demographic, clinical, cognitive correlates of EF, or differences in MRI scanners, regardless of parcellation size ( : Follow-up Regression Models, Table  ).   \nSubnetwork connectivity differences between EF subgroups of PTSD. \n  \nRegression models were conducted (  n   = 314) to determine if PTSD diagnosis, EF subgroups, and their interaction explained FPCN-LN subnetwork connectivity. \n\n Adj   Adjusted,   FPCN   frontal parietal control network,   LN   limbic network,   MT   medial temporal,   EF   executive function. \n\nIndicates   p   < 0.05. \n\nIndicates   p   < 0.01. \n  \n\nGiven these interactions, we next examined how EF subgroups predicted FPCN -LN  and FPCN -LN  separately for those with a diagnosis of PTSD and without a diagnosis of PTSD (Fig.  ). EF subgroups predicted connectivity, but only for those with PTSD (FPCN -LN :   Adj R   = 0.05, EF-  β   = −0.23,   p   = 0.002; FPCN -LN :   Adj R   = 0.04, EF-  β   = −0.21,   p   = 0.005) and not for those without PTSD (FPCN -LN :   Adj R   = 0.002, EF-  β   = 0.08,   p   = 0.400; FPCN -LN :   Adj R   = 0.001, EF-  β   = 0.08,   p   = 0.355). Further, using independent samples   t  -tests, we investigated differences in FPCN -LN  and FPCN -LN  connectivity between EF subgroups in the PTSD sample (Table  ). The impaired EF-PTSD subtype had reduced negative connectivity relative to those with PTSD and average EF(FPCN -LN —  t  (48.60) = 2.67,   p   = 0.010; FPCN -LN —  t(  45.46) = 3.92,   p   < 0.001) or above-average EF (FPCN -LN —  t  (48.34) = 3.49,   p   = 0.001; FPCN -LN —  t  (51.95) = 3.37,   p   = 0.001). Next, we investigated if the average negative connectivity of each EF-PTSD subgroup was significantly different from zero (one-sample   t  -test). This analysis would determine if the connectivity for each EF-PTSD group was significantly negative (i.e., negative connectivity), or not (i.e., reduced negative connectivity). The connectivity for both average and above-average EF groups was significantly different from zero (average EF: FPCN  ~ LN  t  (126) = −4.54,   p   < 0.001, FPCN  ~ LN  t  (126) = −7.03,   p   < 0.001; above-average EF: FPCN  ~ LN  t  (26) = −4.12,   p   < 0.001, FPCN  ~ LN  t  (26) = −4.26,   p   < 0.001), whereas the connectivity for the impaired EF group was not (FPCN  ~ LN :   t  (24) = 0.32,   p   = 0.751; FPCN  ~ LN  t  (24) = 0.44,   p   = 0.664). These analyses indicate that the impaired EF-PTSD subtype had a unique neural signature of reduced negative connectivity between FPCN -LN  and FPCN -LN  compared to the average and above-average EF-PTSD groups. \n\n\n### PTSD chronicity differences across EF subgroups \n  \nWe used linear regression to examine whether PTSD chronicity (i.e., reliable change index; see Methods) differed between the impaired EF-PTSD subtype and the other EF subgroups in those with a PTSD diagnosis at baseline. The EF subgroups significantly predicted PTSD chronicity (  R   = 0.04,   β   = −0.22,   p   = 0.003), such that those with clinically impaired EF at baseline were more likely to have worsening PTSD symptoms, whereas those with above-average EF at baseline showed a decrease in symptom severity (Fig.  ). EF subgroups remained a significant predictor of chronicity after controlling for different categories of covariates including, demographic, clinical, cognitive factors associated with EF, the number of days between baseline and follow-up assessments (  β   = −0.22,   p   = 0.004), or treatment seeking (  β   = −0.34,   p   = 0.017; see  : Follow-up Regression Models and Table  ).    PTSD chronicity.  \n A   Change in PTSD over time for each EF subgroup. Higher RCI scores indicate increasing scores on the CAPS-IV (worsening symptoms) whereas lower RCI indicates decreasing scores on the CAPS-IV (improving symptoms), ** indicate a significant main effect of EF subgroups predicting reliable change index,   p   = 0.003. Within each box, the dot denotes the mean, and the horizontal line denotes the median.

EF executive functioning, RCI reliable change index, Imp impaired EF subgroup, Avg average EF subgroup, Abv above-average EF subgroup, FPCN frontal parietal control network, LN limbic network. \n  \n\nNext, using independent samples   t  -tests, we investigated differences in reliable change index between EF subgroups of PTSD. The impaired EF-PTSD subtype did not differ in chronicity from those with average (  t  (36.74) = 1.23,   p   = 0.215), but did from those with above-average EF (  t  (42.81) = 2.85,   p   = 0.007). In addition, there was reduced chronicity in those with above-average EF compared to average EF (  t  (28.07) = −2.38,   p   = 0.024). These analyses indicate that individuals with PTSD and clinically significant EF impairments had relatively stable and chronic PTSD, whereas those with above-average EF had the most symptom reduction over time (Fig.  ). This suggests a possible additional PTSD-subtype with above-average EF and marked reduction in PTSD symptoms over time. \n\n\n### PTSD chronicity differences across EF subgroups are mediated by FPCN-LN connectivity \n  \nLastly, we considered how functional connectivity predicted change in PTSD symptoms (i.e., reliable change index) and how it may mediate the EF-chronicity relationship. This analysis was conducted in a sample that had both functional connectivity and longitudinal clinical data (  n   = 121, see Fig.  ). To consider whether FPCN -LN  or FPCN -LN  functional connectivity improved prediction of PTSD chronicity, we first considered whether functional connectivity between these subnetworks predicted PTSD chronicity. The FPCN s-LN  predicted the reliable change index (  R   = 0.07,   β   = 0.28,   p   = 0.002), while the FPCN -LN  connectivity did not (  R   = −0.01,   β   = 0.03,   p   = 0.715). Next, we confirmed that EF remained a significant predictor of the reliable change index in this smaller sample (  β   = −0.19,   p   = 0.041). Third, we examined if both FPCN -LN  and EF subgroups predicted unique variance in PTSD chronicity (i.e., reliable change index) when entered as simultaneous predictors in the regression model. In this model (  R   = 0.08, p = 0.002), EF was no longer a significant predictor (  β   = −0.13,   p   = 0.138) while FPCN -LN  remained significant (  β   = 0.26,   p   = 0.005). Finally, we found that FPCN -LN  significantly mediated the relationship between EF subgroups and the reliable change index (Fig.  ; Average Causal Mediation Effect = −0.238, bootstrap = 1000, 95% CI = [−0.51, −0.02],   p   = 0.026). This analysis suggests that EF may predict PTSD chronicity via its relationship to FPCN -LN  connectivity. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe examined neurobiological and longitudinal evidence for a subtype of PTSD with impaired executive functioning (impaired EF-PTSD subtype). To do this, we examined three normative-based groups with impaired, average, or above-average EF in a sample of post-9/11 veterans with and without PTSD. First, we found that those with impaired EF also had worse memory, attention, PTSD symptoms, and alcohol misuse. Second, we found that the impaired EF-PTSD subtype was characterized by specific frontal parietal control network (FPCN) – limbic network (LN) subnetwork connectivity profiles. Namely, this group exhibited reduced negative connectivity between the FPCN -LN  and FPCN -LN  subnetworks. Next, we found that this impaired EF-PTSD subtype had more chronic PTSD relative to those with PTSD and above-average EF. In addition, this relationship between EF and chronicity of PTSD was partially mediated by FPCN -LN  connectivity. Critically, these neural and longitudinal associations with the impaired EF-PTSD subtype were robust to accounting for demographics, clinical, and cognitive factors associated with impaired EF. Together, this study provides evidence that an impaired EF-PTSD subtype has a reliable neural signature, and suggests that both EF and FPCN -LN  connectivity impact the longitudinal trajectory of PTSD. \n\nWe found that the impaired EF-PTSD subtype had reduced negative connectivity between FPCN -LN  and FPCN -LN . This is consistent with prominent neurobiological models of PTSD, which suggest that impoverished recruitment of FPCN regions shown to regulate fear, emotion, and mnemonic processing in limbic regions underlies executive and emotional regulation deficits in PTSD [ ,  ]. Importantly, this study suggests that this neurobiological mechanism of PTSD is reflected primarily in a subset of individuals with clinically significant EF impairments and only between certain FPCN-LN subnetworks. The FPCN  includes brain regions distributed across the brain including rostral lateral and superior prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and middle temporal gyrus [ ,  ]. Recent literature indicates that FPCN  is associated with the control of internal mental processes, such as mind wandering [ ] and emotion processing [ ], and displays increased connectivity with the default mode network [ – ]. Our results indicate that the FPCN has functionally relevant subnetworks that differentially relate to PTSD. The LN  subnetwork—composed of temporal pole regions that are infrequently implicated in the PTSD literature (although see [ ,  ]) has shown connectivity to amygdala and hippocampal regions [ ] which are more commonly associated with PTSD [ ,  ]. These temporal pole regions have been associated with social and emotional processing [ – ] and damage to the temporal pole can lead to unstable mood [ ]. The hippocampus and amygdala (LN ) on the other hand are commonly associated with fear, learning, and memory [ ]. Our results suggest that dysregulated circuitry underlying the cognitive control of social-emotional processes (FPCN -LN ) as well as fear and memory (FPCN -LN ) may characterize PTSD primarily when occurring alongside impaired EF. \n\nThe impaired EF-PTSD subtype exhibited reduced negative resting state connectivity, suggesting a reduction in an antagonistic relationship between FPCN and LN subnetworks (i.e., hypoconnectivity). This is consistent with previous intracranial EEG work that identified antagonistic electrophysiological relationships between brain networks [ ]. However, the direction of resting state connectivity can be driven by different aspects of pre-processing [ ], and describing relative effects across groups is more meaningful. Therefore, an alternative interpretation describes the effect as an increase in functional connectivity between FPCN and LN subnetworks at rest in the impaired EF-PTSD subgroup (i.e., hyperconnectivity). Regardless of the direction of the interpretation (hypoconnectivity vs. hyperconnectivity), the aberrant resting state connectivity in the impaired EF-PTSD group may mark a disruption in emotion or memory regulation [ – ]. Future work using electrophysiological techniques [ ] or concurrent TMS and fMRI to identify the causal relationships between networks [ ,  ], or task-based imaging to isolate information processing [ ], could help adjudicate between these alternative interpretations. \n\nImpaired executive functioning was also associated with worse verbal memory, attention, and other comorbidities such as alcohol abuse. While this is consistent with the transdiagnostic role of EF in risk for a range of psychopathological outcomes [ ], the impaired EF-PTSD subtype had unique associations with FPCN-LN connectivity even when accounting for these cognitive and clinical factors. In addition, defining subgroups based on memory or attention did not reveal differences in FPCN-LN connectivity [ ]. We also found that those with impaired EF were impaired in an independent inhibitory control task, the gradCPT, which has been previously associated with PTSD symptom severity [ ,  ]. Inhibitory control impairments are thought to be the core aspect of EF linked to the development and maintenance of PTSD [ ,  ,  ]. For example, both response inhibition and distractor suppression have been uniquely associated with PTSD when compared to other executive functioning measures [ ]. Nevertheless, the functional networks and cognitive subgroups of PTSD implicated in this study may be related to other cognitive processes beyond EF. “Cool” EF assessed in this study, such as inhibitory control, are also important for other “hot” emotion-related cognitive processes related to PTSD, such as threat detection, fear learning and extinction, and emotional regulation [ ]. As these functions have also been associated with FPCN-LN circuitry [ ,  – ], future work should determine if these EF subgroups are better characterized within the context of these other “hot” cognitive processes related to PTSD. \n\nExecutive functioning and FPCN -LN  connectivity predicted differences in the chronicity of PTSD symptoms over a 1–2-year period. The impaired EF-PTSD subtype exhibited more chronic PTSD relative to those with above-average EF, who demonstrated a reduction in symptom severity compared to those with average EF. FPCN -LN  partially mediated the relationship between EF and PTSD chronicity. These results suggest the those with PTSD and above average EF, while they do not exhibit a unique neural signature, are the most distinct with regard to reduced chronicity, and may represent another PTSD-subtype. These results also lend support to the idea that executive dysfunction contributes to the maintenance of PTSD [ ,  ] and above-average EF may be a protective factor. Previous work has also identified executive dysfunction as a risk factor for developing PTSD [ ,  ] and better EF as indicative of improved treatment outcomes and less dropout [ ,  ,  ]. In addition, connectivity in regions associated with emotional regulation and EF predict PTSD symptoms post-trauma [ ], consistent with the role of FPCN-LN in mediating the relationship between EF and PTSD chronicity. Together, impaired EF may increase susceptibility to chronic PTSD via reduced negative connectivity between brain networks involved in emotion regulation (FPCN -LN ) whereas those with above-average EF have more neurocognitive resources that allows for better recovery after trauma. \n\nOne significant limitation of this study is that incomplete data was collected for treatment-seeking between baseline and follow-up. Without detailed information on treatment between baseline and follow-up, we could not with certainty determine whether EF subgroups differ in chronicity due to differences in treatment-seeking behaviors or differences in treatment resistance. However, we observed no differences in baseline medication usage across EF subgroups, suggesting that EF subgroups were not driven by medically-induced impairments at baseline. In a subset of participants, we found that treatment seeking was similar across EF subgroups (86–93%). While treatment seeking individuals were overall more chronic, this effect did not account for the EF subgroup effect on chronicity ( ). These results point to the challenge in treating PTSD [ ] in that those seeking treatment did not necessarily improve. Although, without treatment type and duration information available, the role of treatment in these EF subgroups remains inconclusive. \n\nAnother limitation is that data was not collected immediately post-trauma. Thus, it is unclear if the observed neurocognitive markers are risk factors, caused by chronic PTSD or related to other psychosocial factors such as work, family, and social support. We did observe that estimated pre-morbid verbal abilities differed across EF subgroups and predicted FPCN -LN  connectivity (Table  ). This indicates that FPCN -LN  connectivity may reflect multiple aspects of premorbid cognitive functioning and could be a vulnerability factor for PTSD. Future research that investigates pre-trauma or acute trauma assessments [ ] of cognitive ability and brain functioning will help determine how neurocognitive functions serve as risk or protective factors for the development of PTSD and related comorbidities. Additionally, this study has limited generalizability of the impaired EF-PTSD subgroup outside of white male veterans, who may have specific educational background and trauma experiences relative to other less represented individuals. Future work should invest resources towards recruiting a more representative sample to investigate the generalizability of this impaired EF-PTSD subgroup. Finally, future work that uses other neuroimaging approaches such as task-based fMRI may help better identify neurocognitive subtypes of PTSD [ ]. \n\nExplaining heterogeneity in PTSD is a critical goal to improving treatment and quality of life in victims of trauma. This study examined neurobiological and clinical longitudinal evidence for a cognitive subtype of PTSD. We found that this impaired EF-PTSD subtype exhibited dysconnectivity between specific subnetworks of the FPCN and LN. In addition, these individuals with PTSD and impaired EF had more chronic PTSD after ~2 years. The results suggest treatments personalized for this impaired EF-PTSD subtype should consider targeting EF (e.g., via cognitive training) or these FPCN-LN circuits (e.g., via brain stimulation) to improve PTSD and functional outcomes. Thus, the described impaired EF-PTSD subtype contributes to understanding risk and recovery, personalized treatment approaches, and neurocognitive models of PTSD. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"66b5130a25d57512322593e7ec52b675"},

The method utilizes 4-nodes networks of mutual interacted BOLD signals to obtains their temporal hierarchy and functional connectivity. Patterns of signal progression were defined at frequency windows by appealing to a hierarchy based upon phase differences, and their significance was assessed by permutation testing. Assuming consistent phase relationship between neuronal and fMRI signals and unidirectional coupling, we were able to characterize directed pathways in the visual system. The ventral and dorsal systems were found to have different functional organizations. The dorsal system, particularly of the left hemisphere, had numerous feedforward pathways connecting the striate and extrastriate cortices with non-visual regions. The ventral system had fewer pathways primarily of two types: (1) feedback pathways initiated in the fusiform gyrus that were either confined to the striate and the extrastriate cortices or connected to the temporal cortex, (2) feedforward pathways initiated in V2, excluded the striate cortex, and connected to non-visual regions. The multivariate measure demonstrated higher specificity than bivariate (pairwise) measure. The analysis can be applied to other neuroimaging and electrophysiological data. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nUnderstanding the organization of large scale neural networks is essential for the understanding of brain function . For this purpose, neuroimaging data of MRI, EEG and MEG can be used to construct structural (anatomical links), functional or effective connectivity macroscopic scale networks . Directed functional connectivity refers to methods that appeal to temporal precedence to infer directed connectivity . These include Granger causality , phase-transfer entropy  and the multivariate method we have recently introduced that is based upon nonlinear coherences among multiple time-series and systematic phase delays between the regions . Here, we used an elaboration of this method to identify pathways of signal progression within the visual system and compare characteristics of the dorsal and ventral streams. For these purposes we extended the method and introduced a statistical framework that enables to obtain model-free identification of signal progression patterns. By assuming a fixed relationship between neuronal and hemodynamic phases and a constant hemodynamic response (delays) across the measured systems, our method infers patterns of neural information flow. In contrast to other functional connectivity methods that are based on temporal similarity and connectivity strength (i.e. amplitudes), our method is based on temporal hierarchy between multiple time-series (i.e., the temporal order of signal progression) and on nonlinear coherence between them (i.e. phases). For the application of the method to functional MRI (fMRI) data, there is a need to assume that the hemodynamic lag faithfully reproduces temporal precedence at the neuronal level. Based on our  and others results, we will make this simplifying assumption to demonstrate the potential usefulness of our method for fMRI. Previous fMRI studies  showed that time-lag propagates within conventionally known resting-state networks and therefore can be used to infer MRI signal progression and its directionality . \n\nCortical visual processing is commonly thought to proceed along two distinct pathways: a fast, highly recurrent, dorsal pathway projecting into the parietal cortex and a slower ventral pathway projecting into the inferior temporal cortex. These pathways were identified in monkeys as anatomically and functionally distinct systems of multisynaptic connections emerging from the striate cortex . The initial conception of the ventral stream was that of a serial hierarchical pathway starting at the striate cortex (area V1), passing through a sequence of processing stages in the extrastriate cortex until complex object representations are formed in the anterior part of the inferior temporal cortex (area IT) . A more recent view based on electrophysiology measurements in macaques, claims that the ventral visual pathway is a recurrent and highly interactive occipitotemporal network linking early visual areas and the anterior IT cortex along multiple routes through which visual information is processed . Likewise, the original notion of the serial processing stages in the dorsal stream was challenged by recent findings suggesting several distinct pathways that emerge from this stream . Furthermore, previous studies have shown that the dorsal system is even more complex. For example, earlier activations in MT than in V1 have been demonstrated . Such findings suggest that the extrastriate cortex in the dorsal but not in the ventral stream is activated early enough to be able to influence subsequent processing through feedback connections to V1 . \n\nHere, we applied our directed functional connectivity method to resting-state fMRI data of 40 healthy young subjects. We aimed to test whether the pathways obtained in the visual system using resting-state data are in line with previous studies that mainly were obtained by stimulus driven data. Such findings will suggest common patterns of resting-state and stimulus driven data and on the other hand will validate the application of our method to fMRI data. Furthermore, based on the literature described above demonstrating different organizations of the ventral and dorsal streams, we aimed to capture these differences correctly, such that it would be possible to detect distinct patterns of coupling in normal subjects or, perhaps, aberrant patterns or disconnections in psychiatric disorders . \n\n\n## Mathematical Methodology \n  \nRecently we have shown that for a network composed of 4 coupled time-series, the network’s functional connectivity strength (i.e. amplitude) and the relations between the 4 time-series phases (i.e. coherence) can be analytically described as a function of time and frequency . Using wavelet analysis we have shown that for each time-frequency point there are three distinct forms of interactions between the 4 coupled time-series, each corresponding to a different coherence. The full interaction can be obtained (but used here only for comparison with bivariate strength, see below) by multiplying the 3 distinct expressions. The validity of the full interaction expression can be tested, for example, in the case where time-series 1 and 2 are equal and so are time-series 3 and 4. In this case, the full interaction converges to pairwise coherence as expected. The three distinct coherences (termed in hereafter “functional connectivity”, FC) equal: where,   is the wavelet coefficient in time and frequency of time-series ‘  j1  ’,   is the phase of time-series ‘  j1  ’,   ‘A’   is the coherence amplitude, *denotes the complex conjugate and   ‘i’   is the imaginary unit. The nonlinear coherence phases  , φ   , φ   and   φ  , can be computed according to Equation   and were used to obtain the phases of the time-series for each frequency and time point : where   is due to the freedom in the phase definition which requires specification of the sign . Following the logic that phases correspond to time-lags at each frequency and time points, Equation   can be used to define the hierarchical temporal order among the 4 time-series. Note that for the definition of directed functional connectivity given below, only the phases (Equation  ) were used and not the amplitude of functional connectivity. This is in line with the definition of related nonlinear coupling measures that are based on phase relationships, such as phase dispersion or phase locking analyses. Note that the phase differences of Equation   are different from the corresponding pairwise phase-differences since they include the effect of the other time-series as well. \n\nTo fully characterize a network of 4 time-series, the network’s temporal order of the time-series needs to be identified, namely the order of signal propagation among the time-series which is given by the temporal pathway that describes how the signal is propagating throughout the network. Acknowledging that the phases of the time-series (at each frequency) are related to time-delays, the phases can be used to outline a unique ordinal or hierarchical ranking of signal progression. A network of 4 time-series has 24 ( = 4!) possible pathways (listed in Table  ). Using the phases to define ordinal ranking requires to assume that all phases are below 2π.For example, consider the signal progression pathway: R1 → R2 → R3 → R4, where R1 to R4 represent the 4 time-series. If we use the phase of R1 as a reference, Equation   can be used to calculate the three phase-differences between the time-series:  . If  , the pathway can mistakenly be identified as R4 → R1 → R2 → R3. This demonstrates a bias in pathway identification. It also shows that pathway definition depends on the reference phase. To overcome these biases, we introduce the concept of “Circular Pattern” (CP). A circular pattern defines how signals propagate within the network. For example we note that pathways: R1 → R2 → R3 → R4, R2 → R3 → R4 → R1, R3 → R4 → R1 → R2 and R4 → R1 → R2 → R3 have all the same pattern of signal progressing but are differ in their starting point within this pattern. Circular-patterns are invariant to the choice of reference phase, and are less sensitive to phase values greater then 2  π  . We note that a CP does not give the temporal order of the time series but only its pattern of signal progression. To obtain a pathway from a CP, an assumption for the starting point has to be made. Table   show that for a network of 4 time-series there are six possible CPs, where each CP includes 4 different pathways. We note that the six CPs can be divided into three pairs (CP1 and CP4; CP2 and CP3; CP5 and CP6) where each CP in the pair is of an opposite flow pattern. These pairs are the consequence of the intrinsic directional freedom in the definition of phases that mathematically is expressed by the   sign in Equation  . Note that the above CP analysis can be performed for each time-frequency point, therefore enabling one to characterize the dynamics of signal progression. In other words, one can in principle evaluate circular patterns instantaneously at any desired frequency. This enables to track dynamic changes in the hierarchical patterns of coupling. We will address this elsewhere.   \nThe six Circular Patterns (CPs) presented as squares with lines corresponding to flow organization among the four time-series (R1 to R4). \n  \nIn this illustration, flow is possible only along the lines connecting pairs of time-series. The four pathways corresponding to the CPs are listed below each CP. These pathways have the same flow pattern but they are different in their starting point. Note that CP1 and CP4; CP2 and CP3; and CP5 and CP6 correspond to pairs of opposite flow. \n  \n\nTo test for the significance of the CPs, we adopted the common approach used in coherence studies. A group expectation value was calculated for each CP. This expectation value was named “Circular-Pattern Index” (CPI) and is defined on the phases as: where ‘k’ is a specific CP (k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6). In Equation  , it is tested for each subject separately whether the 4 time-series network’s phases are in line with the CP, i.e. if they are consistent with one of the four pathways which characterize the CP (Table  ). The calculations for the 6 CPs (Equation  ) are all done according to the same selection of phase direction in Equation  . This selection reduces the degeneracy of the CP pairs. Equation   is defined similarly to the definition of the Phase Locking Value (PLV)  or the Phase Lag Index (PLI) . Namely, for each subject and each CP, a value of 1 is assigned when the network phases are in agreement with this CP, and zero is assigned when there isn’t an agreement. Consequently, if the probability to obtain a specific CP ‘k’ among the N subjects is low, the CPI  will be close to zero. On the other hand, for a high probability of obtaining this CP, CPI  will be high and approach unity. Permutation-based non-parametric tests with uncoupled time-series were used to obtain the CPI null distributions for each CP at each frequency and assign a   p  -value for certain CPI  which is defined in terms of pattern-specific indicator functions. \n\nFigure   illustrates how the pathways are defined. A 4 time-series network is assigned a CP when its pathway is among the four relevant pathways included in the CP, as listed in Table  .   \nAn illustration of the process applied to define directed multivariate functional pathways in a 4 time-series network. (  A  ) A network of 4 time-series (R1, R2, R3 and R4), where the first three are the average BOLD signals from predefined seeds and the forth is the BOLD signal of a voxel. (  B  ) 2D representation (mod) of the wavelet decomposition into time and frequency. (  C  ) Coherence between the 4 time-series, obtained by Equation  . (  D  ) The three relative phases of the time-series for a certain time-frequency point. (  E  ) These phase relations define the hierarchical order of the network. To infer directionality, an additional assumption is required, for example: positive Δ  means the direction is   i  →  j  . (  F  ) The directed pathway. \n  \n\nTo infer directionality within the CPs, i.e. whether a signal is progressing in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction and to define its starting point (i.e. the directed pathway), an assumption or prior knowledge must be used. Note that in the definition of a CP only the phase-differences are considered and the functional connectivity amplitudes are not used. This distinguishes the current analysis of multivariate directed functional connectivity from other (bivariate) functional connectivity analyses, since the majority of other analyses focus on the amplitude. In other words, while most functional connectivity analyses are based on temporal similarity between pairs of time-series, our analysis is based on temporal hierarchy between multiple time-series. This means that in a hypothetical network of 4 identical time series, functional connectivity analyses that are based on temporal similarity (i.e. amplitude) will result with maximum functional connectivity, while our analysis that is based on temporal hierarchy will not assign a pathway to such a network since no temporal hierarchy can be defined. In this respect, our CPI measure is similar to the pairwise PLI (Phase Lag Index) measure. However, the key difference between our new method and the existing PLI method is that our method considers high order mutual information (characterized in terms of wavelet coefficients and phases) which makes it a multivariate measure versus the bivariate measure used in PLI. In other words, our method is a high order measure of directed functional connectivity versus the second order (pairwise PLI) measure of directed functional connectivity. \n\nTo identify significant CPIs in the whole brain, we constructed   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs  . A   3-seed-CPI   -SPM   is a statistical parametric map of CPI number k.   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   are seed-like SPMs but instead of using a single seed, three seeds are used and a CPI based on 4 time-series networks is calculated. A   3-seed-CPI   -SPM   is composed of N CPI, where N is the number of voxels that were calculated using Equation  . For each subject, the phases of 4 BOLD time-series were used in the CPI calculations. Each of the 4 time-series networks was constructed using 3 seed time-series and a fourth time-series of a voxel. These networks were calculated for every voxel and every subject. The 3 seed time-series were the average BOLD signals from 3 predefined regions, identified by masks based on Brodmann areas (see below). \n\nWe further used the 3 seed approach to identify a fourth seed that showed coupling with the initial (early visual) 3 seeds. This then allowed us to look at different combinations of 3 seeds and identify sets of four time-series within which we could identify significant circular patterns. This analysis was repeated for four frequency scales obtained by binning a wavelet decomposition into four cardinal frequency bins. \n\nIn summary, we used high order (multivariate) characterization of directed functional connectivity to construct statistical parametric maps (SPM) of nonlinear coupling between every voxel in the brain and a set of (three) seeds or reference regions. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Circular patterns of the visual system \n  \nResting-state fMRI data of 40 heathy young subjects were used to calculate   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   of the ventral and the dorsal visual systems for the right and left hemispheres. Directed pathways from these networks were then inferred. Due to the interaction of the visual system with many other brain systems and our goal to characterize specifically the ventral and dorsal systems, three seeds were chosen in the early visual stages (V1, V2 and V3) and were confined to the dorsal or ventral systems. The fourth seed was chosen from the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   that were obtained using the first 3 seeds (for the ventral and dorsal systems, separately). All 4 combinations of   3-seed-CPI  -  SPMs   calculations, each using 3 seeds, were performed. The 25 frequency scales of the wavelet analysis were grouped into 4 frequency scales: scale 1 = 0.01–0.03 Hz; scale 2 = 0.03–0.044 Hz; scale 3 = 0.047–0.067 Hz and scale 4 = 0.074–0.1 Hz. \n\n#### The ventral system \n  \nFor the ventral system, we used the following four predefined seeds: the primary visual cortex (in hereafter termed ‘V1’), the secondary visual cortex of the ventral system (in hereafter termed ‘V2_ventral’), the associative visual cortex of the ventral system (in hereafter termed ‘V3_ventral’) and a region that was found significant by   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   of the first three seeds, and was within the fusiform gyrus (in hereafter termed ‘FG’). The analyses were done separately for seeds of the right and left hemispheres. A 3D plot of the four seeds is shown in Supplementary Figure  . 3  -seed-CPI   -SPMs   were calculated for the following seed combinations: (1) R1 = V1, R2 = V2_ventral, R3 = V3_ventral; (2) R1 = V1, R2 = V2_ventral, R3 = FG; (3) R1 = V1, R2 = V3_ventral, R3 = FG and (4) R1 = V2_ventral, R2 = V3_ventral, R3 = FG. \n\nFor the first seed combination, all significant networks obtained by the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   calculations were characterized by CP no. 1 and were found in frequency scales 2 and 3, for both hemispheres. A ‘network’ refers hereinafter to the functional connectivity of 4 time-series; the BOLD signals of the three seeds and a voxel, defined by Equation   that passed the statistical cutoff (see method). In this respect, the number of networks equals to the number of significant voxels. These voxels are aggregated in clusters due to the applied cluster-size statistical threshold and are shown by 3D plots. Figure   show 3D plots of the 3  -seed-CPI   -SPMs   networks for seeds in the left hemisphere (left column) and seeds in the right hemisphere (right column). All significant clusters were located in the fusiform gyrus, known to be part of the ventral stream. Table   presents the number of significant networks, their CP and frequency scale.   \n3-  seed-CPI   -SPMs   of the ventral stream. The figure shows 3D representations of significant clusters included in the circular-patterns (CPs). Different CPs are indicated by the color bar. (  A  )   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   for seed combination 1 (R1 = V1, R2 = V2_ventral, R3 = V3_ventral) of the left and right hemispheres.

(  C  )   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   for seed combination 3 (R1 = V1, R2 = V3_ventral, R3 = FG) of the left and right hemispheres. (  D  )   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   for seed combination 4 (R1 = R2_ventral, R2 = V3_ventral, R3 = FG) of the left and right hemispheres. ‘FG’ indicates a cluster defined within the fusiform gyrus. \n    \nNumbers of ‘4 time series’ networks of the ventral and the dorsal systems. \n  \nNetworks were made from time series of 3 seeds and a voxel and are defined by the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs  . Numbers of networks are given for the four seed combinations arranged by their CP’s, frequency scales and hemisphere. For the ventral system the seed combinations were: combination 1: V1, V2_ventral, V3_ventral; combination 2:V1, V2_ventral, FG; combination 3: V1, V3_ventral, FG; combination 4: V2_ventral, V3_ventral_FG. For the dorsal system the combinations were: combination 1: V1, V2_dorsal, V3_dorsal; combination 2:V1, V2_dorsal, SP; combination 3: V1, V3_dorsal, SP; combination 4: V2_dorsal, V3_dorsal_SP. ‘FG’ indicates a cluster within the fusiform gyrus and ‘SP’ indicates a cluster defined within the superior parietal gyrus. \n  \n\nFor the second seed combination, significant networks obtained by the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   calculations for the left hemisphere were characterized by CP no. 1 in scale 2 and CP no. 2 in scales 1 and 2. For the right hemisphere, significant networks were characterized by CP no. 2 in scales 1 and 2 (Table  ). Figure   show 3D plots of the 3  -seed-CPI   -SPMs   networks for seeds in the left hemisphere (left column) and right hemisphere (right column). Significant clusters were found within the ventral system including V2_ventral, V3_ventral and the fusiform gyrus. Significant clusters were also found in the dorsal system including V3_dorsal and regions within the temporal gyrus. \n\nFor the third seed combination, significant networks obtained by the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   calculations for the left hemisphere were characterized by CP no. 6 in scales 2 and 3. For the right hemisphere, significant networks were characterized by CP no. 6 in scales 2 and 3 (Table  ). Fig.   show 3D plots of these 3  -seed-CPI   -SPMs   networks for the left and right hemispheres. Significant clusters were found bilaterally in the extrastriate cortex, mainly within its ventral parts. \n\nFor the fourth seed combination, significant networks obtained by the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   calculations for the left hemisphere were characterized by CP no. 4 in scale 1. For the right hemisphere, significant networks were characterized by CP no. 4 in scale 1 (Table  ). Figure   show 3D plots of the 3  -seed-CPI   -SPMs   for seeds in the left hemisphere (left column) and right hemisphere (right column). Whereas significant clusters of the left hemisphere were mainly restricted to associative somatosensory and frontal areas, the right hemisphere included multiple clusters distributed across the cortex and subcortex. \n\n\n#### The dorsal system \n  \nFor the dorsal system, we used the following four predefined seeds: the primary visual cortex (V1), the secondary visual cortex of the dorsal system (in hereafter termed ‘V2_dorsal’), the associative visual cortex of the dorsal system (in hereafter termed ‘V3_dorsal’) and a fourth seed that was constructed by the use of significant clusters obtained by   3-seed-CPI   -SPM  s of the first three seeds and included clusters within the superior parietal gyrus (in hereafter termed ‘SP’, see method). The analyses were done for seeds of the right hemisphere and for seeds of the left hemisphere separately. A 3D plot of the four seeds is shown in Supplementary Figure  . 3  -seed-CPI   -SPMs   were calculated for all combinations of choosing three out of the four seeds: (1) R1 = V1, R2 = V2_dorsal, R3 = V3_dorsal; (2) R1 = V1, R2 = V2_dorsal, R3 = SP; (3) R1 = V1, R2 = V3_dorsal, R3 = SP and (4) R1 = V2_dorsal, R2 = V3_dorsal, R3 = SP. \n\nFor the first seed combination, all significant networks obtained by the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   calculations were characterized by CP number 4. For the left hemisphere, networks were found in scales 1,2,4 and for the right hemisphere in scales 1 and 2 (Table  ). Fig.   show 3D plots of the 3  -seed-CPI   -SPMs   for seeds in the left hemisphere (left column) and seeds in the right hemisphere (right column). Networks in the right hemisphere were found within the extrastriate and associative somatosensory cortices and in addition in lateral frontal areas, including the frontal eye fields (FEF). Networks of the left hemisphere were found in the same areas with larger clusters. For both hemispheres, the distribution of clusters highly overlapped with the dorsal attention network (DAN), including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the FEF. For the left hemisphere, additional clusters were indicated in the ventral attention network (VAN), including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and ventral frontal cortex (VFC). \n\nFor the second seed combination, significant networks obtained by the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   calculations for the left hemisphere were characterized by CP no. 3 in scales 1 and 2 and CP no. 4 in scale 1. For the right hemisphere, significant networks were characterized by CP no. 2 in scale 3, CP no. 3 in scales 1,2 and CP no. 4 in scale 2 (Table  ). Fig.   show 3D plots of the 3  -seed-CPI   -SPMs   for seeds in the left hemisphere (left column) and seeds in the right hemisphere (right column). Significant clusters of CP numbers 2 and 3 were within the extrastriate and associative somatosensory cortices, which are known to be a part of the dorsal system, whereas significant clusters of CP no. 4 included also remote regions such as the frontal gyrus and specifically the FEF. The left TPJ, IPS and FEF were included in networks of both left and right hemispheres.   \n3-  seed-CPI   -SPMs   of the dorsal stream. The figure shows 3D representations of significant clusters included in the circular-patterns (CPs). Different CPs are indicated by the color bar. (  A  )   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   for seed combination 1 (R1 = V1, R2 = V2_dorsal, R3 = V3_dorsal) of the left and right hemispheres. (  B  )   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   s for seed combination 2 (R1 = V1, R2 = V2_dorsal, R3 = SP) of the left and right hemispheres. (  C  )   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   for seed combination 3 (R1 = V1, R2 = V3_dorsal, R3 = SP) of the left and right hemispheres. (  D  )   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   for seed combination 4 (R1 = R2_dorsal, R2 = V3_dorsal, R3 = SP) of the left and right hemispheres. ‘SP’ indicates a cluster defined within the superior parietal gyrus. \n  \n\nFor the third seed combination, significant networks obtained by the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   calculations for the left hemisphere were characterized by CP no. 4 in scales 1,2,3 and CP no. 5 in scales 1,2. For the right hemisphere, significant networks were characterized by CP no. 4 in scales 1,2,3 and CP. no 5 in scale 2 (Table  ). Fig.   show 3D plots of the 3  -seed-CPI   -SPMs  . Significant clusters of CP no. 5 of the left hemisphere were found within the striate and extrastriate cortices, and significant clusters of CP no. 4 for both hemispheres were distributed in the entire dorsal system, including regions in the DAN and VAN. Note that much more networks were found for seeds in the left hemisphere compared to the right hemisphere, with widespread involvement of almost the entire cortex. \n\nFor the fourth seed combination, all significant networks were characterized by CP no. 4. For the left hemisphere, networks were found in scales 1,2,3 and 4. For the right hemisphere, networks were found in scales 1,2 and 3 (Table  ). Figure   show 3D plots of the 3  -seed-CPI   -SPMs  . Significant clusters were found within the ventral system and the entire bilateral dorsal system. Whereas networks of seeds in the left hemisphere covered almost the entire cortex and subcortex, networks of the right hemisphere were smaller, less distributed and included the DAN. \n\nTable   suggests that there was no effect of frequency (scale). Permutation-based non-parametric tests show that for the dorsal system the number of networks for seeds in the left hemisphere was significantly higher than the number of networks for seeds in the right hemisphere in seed combinations 3 and 4. This was due to more networks in the left hemisphere that connected the dorsal system with non-visual regions characterized by CP no. 4 (e.g. the DAN). In contrast, the number of networks that were confined to the dorsal system, were about equal between the hemispheres. An additional finding of greater significance was the higher number of networks in the dorsal system compared to the ventral system, for either right or left hemispheres. These results support pathways of information flow specifically between the dorsal visual system and the VAN and DAN. \n\n\n\n### Comparison of 4 time-series to pairwise coherences analyses \n  \nTo examine the extent to which the results above are unique for the new multivariate 4 time-series analysis, we compared it to bivariate pairwise coherence analyse. Specifically, we aimed to test whether the differences found between the dorsal and ventral systems namely, a greater extent of connectivity of the left dorsal system to non-visual regions, can be also identified by second order pairwise coherence analysis. \n\nPairwise functional connectivity was obtained similarly to previous studies : \n\nAverage over time was performed for the resting-state data as in the multivariate analysis. For testing coherence phase significance, we used the Phase Lag Index (PLI)  method since it is more similar to the CPI than the phase locking value (PLV). The V2 region was chosen for comparison, and the pairwise coherence analyses was computed for the V2_ventral and V2_dorsal seeds of the left and right hemispheres, the same seeds that were used in the multivariate analysis.   Seed-PLI-SPMs   were obtained by calculating pairwise coherences (between a seed and a voxel time-series, for all voxels in the brain) for each frequency, using wavelet analysis with the same frequency scales.   Seed-PLI-SPMs   of V2_ventral and V2_dorsal seeds of the right and left hemispheres are shown in Supplementary Figure  . \n\n Seed-PLI-SPMs   of different frequency scales were largely overlapping, suggesting no effect of scale, similarly to the finding for the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs  . As seen in Supplementary Figure  ,   Seed-PLI-SPMs   of V2 regions were confined to the early visual areas and were almost invariant to left and right choices. This contrasts with the results for the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   that were very different for the left and right hemispheres (Figs   and  ).   Seed-PLI-SPMs   of V2_ventral had about twice significant pairwise coherences compared with the V2_dorsal which is opposite to the results obtained with   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs  . Note also that the number of significant pairwise coherences was much lower compared with the number of significant networks obtained by the multivariate analysis. \n\nTo test whether the differences found in coherence phases between the multivariate and bivariate analyses were complimented by differences in coherence strength (amplitude), we calculated the average coherence strength for both analyses over all voxels. Namely, the average bivariate coherence strength of the left and right V2_ventral and V2_dorsal seeds over all voxels and frequency scales. Similarly, we calculated the average multivariate coherence strength of the left and right ventral and dorsal 3-seed networks of combination IV (using R1 = V2_ventral, R2 = V3_ventral, R3 = FG for the ventral stream and R1 = V2_ventral, R2 = V3_dorsal, R3 = SP for the dorsal stream), over all voxels. Supplementary Figure   shows these results. Whereas there were no differences between ventral and dorsal bivariate coherence strengths for all scales, significant differences were found between the ventral and the dorsal 4 time-series networks’ strength for the right and the left hemispheres (with p < 0.01 paired t-test for all comparisons besides the comparison of the left hemisphere at scale 1). For the 4-timeseries analysis, the ventral stream had stronger coherence strength for all scales with differences in strength a function of scale. Note that the amplitude values, for the bivariate and the multivariate analyses, changed approximately as 1/f, as expected. \n\nTaken together, the results suggest marked differences between the 4 time-series and pairwise coherence analyses with higher specificity of the former. \n\n\n### Directed pathways in the visual system \n  \nTo obtain directed pathways from the CPs, two assumptions are needed. A global assumption for the directionality of signal progression within the CP and a local assumption for the region in which the pathway starts. We assume that fMRI BOLD time-lags are related to neuronal time-lags and therefore BOLD signals, in the majority of pathways, progress from lower to higher visual areas. This is based on previous studies suggesting neuronal flow from V1 to higher visual areas . To determine the global flow directionality, we used the following two considerations: one, in all the four possible seed combinations, the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   calculations were performed with the first three seeds (R1, R2 and R3 in Table  ) chosen according to the expected hierarchy of the system, where R1 is the lower visual area of the three seeds and R3 the highest visual area (e.g. R1 = V1 R2 = V2 and R3 = V3). Second, as shown in Figs   and   and Table  , most networks were characterized by CP no. 4 (i.e. R4-R3-R2-R1). Taking together the above and expecting that the majority of pathways will correspond to signal flow from lower to higher visual areas, this implies that the directionality within CP no. 4 is R1→R2→R3→R4 which is a counter-clockwise directionality. Although Equations   and   do not infer that the same directionality exists in all networks (i.e. networks with different seeds), we argue that once directionality is defined it is valid to all CPs. This is since BOLD temporal signals of all regions are locked such that the phase-difference’s signs, that determine directionality, are related. Consequently, to construct directed pathways for all other CPs, we need also to assume counter-clockwise directionality. For the local definition of where the pathway starts in each CP, the expected low ↔ high visual hierarchal organization is used. Note, that even without using the last assumption, our analysis infer the existence of both feedforward and feedback pathways in the visual system. \n\n#### The ventral system \n  \nFour CPs were identified in the ventral system. For the first seed combination, CP no. 1 (V1-V2-V3-R4) was identified where R4 included clusters within the fusiform gyrus. Counter clockwise directionality and low ↔ high hierarchal organization suggest the directed pathway: FG → V3 → V2 → V1. For the second seed combination, CP no. 2 (V1-V2-R4-FG) was identified where R4 included clusters within V2_ventral, V3_ventral, the fusiform gyrus and regions known to be part of the left dorsal stream (e.g. the middle temporal gyrus). Counter clockwise directionality and low ↔ high hierarchal organization suggest the following directed pathways: FG → V3/V2 → V2 → V1 and FG → MT → V2 → V1. For the third combination, CP no. 6 (V1-R4-V3-FG) was identified where R4 included clusters within V2_ventral. Counter clockwise directionality and low ↔ high hierarchal organization suggest the directed pathway: FG → V3 → V2 → V1. For the fourth seed combination, CP no. 4 (V2-R4-FG-V3) was identified where R4 included various distributed clusters in both hemispheres. Applying the same assumptions as above, this leads to the directed pathway: V2 → V3 → FG → R4. \n\n\n#### The dorsal system \n  \nSeven CPs were identified in the dorsal system. The majority of networks were characterized by CP no. 4 (96%). For the first seed combination, CP no. 4 (V1-R4-V3-V2) was identified where R4 included largely distributed clusters. Counter clockwise directionality and low ↔ high hierarchal organization suggest the following directed pathway: V1 → V2 → V3 → R4. For the second seed combination, CPs no. 2,3, and 4 were identified. R4 clusters in CP no. 2 (V1-V2-R4-SP) were mainly found within the extrastriate cortex. Counter clockwise directionality and low ↔ high hierarchal organization suggest the directed pathway: V1 → V2 → V2/V3 → SP. R4 in CP no 3 (V1-SP-R4-V2) included clusters within the superior parietal gyrus. Counter clockwise directionality and low ↔ high hierarchal organization suggest the directed pathway: V1 → V2 → R4 → SP. CP no. 4 (V1-R4-SP-V2) included R4 clusters in multiple remote areas of the dorsal stream. Counter clockwise directionality and low ↔ high hierarchal organization suggest the pathway: V1 → V2 → SP → R4. For the third seed combination, CPs no. 4 and 5 were identified. CP no. 4 (V1-R4-SP-V3) included R4 clusters across the entire dorsal stream. For this CP, counter clockwise directionality and low ↔ high hierarchal organization suggest the pathway: V1 → V3 → SP → R4. CP no. 5 (V1-SP-V3-R4) included R4 clusters within the striate and extrastriate cortices, and its directionality is suggested to be: V1 → R4 → V3 → SP. For the fourth seed combination, CP no. 4 (V2-R4-SP-V3) was identified where R4 clusters were mainly distributed outside the visual system, in addition to clusters within the entire dorsal and ventral streams. Counter clockwise directionality and low ↔ high hierarchal organization suggest the pathway: V2 → V3 → SP → R4. \n\nFigure   summarizes these pathways for the ventral (4A) and dorsal (4B) systems in a box-arrow diagram. In the figure, arrows represent the predominantly direction of coupling. For both streams, pathways that connect the visual system with other systems (e.g. frontal regions) were feedforward. Pathways within the early visual cortex were of opposite directionality between the streams: dorsal pathways were feedforward while ventral pathways were feedback. Note, that whereas pathways of the ventral stream that included regions outside the visual system didn’t contain the striate cortex, pathways of the dorsal stream that included regions outside the visual system involved the striate and the extrastriate cortices.   \nDirected functional pathways of the ventral and dorsal systems during resting-state acquisition with eyes open. Pathways were inferred from the circular-patterns (CPs) that were obtained by the 3  -seed-CPI   -SPMs   calculations. The method enables to infer directed functional pathways of 4 stages. Solid arrows indicate the inferred directions and different pathways are indicated by colors.

The analysis enables to obtain functional patterns of signal progression in a network of 4 time-series In our approach, three are the average BOLD signals of predefined regions and the forth is the BOLD temporal signal of a voxel. A circular-pattern flow, one out of possible 6 which characterizes the signal progression, was assigned to each network using only the network’s phases (Fig.  ). In this respect, our analysis is different from most other connectivity analyses which utilize connectivity strength. An intrinsic limitation of the analysis is that it is limited to four network nodes. This may possibly result with an over simplified description of signal progression and with a limited ability to characterize accurately a certain pathway. However, this remains an advantage of the method over existing functional connectivity analyses that are limited to two nodes. Another limitation that is specific for resting-state data is the need to average along time. The wavelet coefficients used in the analysis were associated with time-averaged signals and thus the directionality found is the average directionality. This limitation, however, is common to all resting-state data analyses. We note that the analysis can be used with other imaging types including stimulus driven data for which no time averaging is required enabling dynamic study. Last, for simplicity, we have limited our analysis to continuous pathways. The case of general flow patterns will be dealt in a future study. \n\nOur results were obtained with resting-state fMRI data therefore, could be limited to this type of data. However, increasing evidence suggests that neurons   in vivo   are active in the absent of external input and that this spontaneous activity has a coherent structure. In support of this possibility, neurophysiological studies have shown that the activity of individual neurons is similar across spontaneous and stimulus-driven brain states . Furthermore, multiple neuroimaging studies have shown a correspondence between spontaneous and stimulus-driven states consistent with the idea that the brain has an intrinsic functional architecture . Additionally, interhemispheric coupling of somatosensory regions and of auditory cortices were synchronized in response to stimulus at 20–30 Hz and 7–12 Hz respectively and these frequencies were also selective to these interregional interactions during spontaneous activity . Consequently, we assume that our findings are applicable to the visual system in general, and in the discussion below we refer to previous findings of single- or multi-unit recordings as well as of stimulus driven data to support our findings. \n\nCoherence between 4 time-series at a given time-frequency window implies that all four time-series are mutually coupled. This means that key characteristics of the signals (within these windows) coexist in all the time-series. For such mutual coupling to occur, interaction between the four time-series must happen simultaneously (i.e., within the time-resolution of the data). This implies that the time resolution of data acquisition might affect the results, giving a higher weight to faster signal transfer processes. Several other scenarios that enable such mutual coherences can be considered, including recurrent connections. The issue of whether we can discern feedforward (or unilateral feedback) connections from reciprocal or recurrent connections is outstanding. Local processing and recurrent connections could either increase or decrease phase differences, with subsequent effects on our circular pattern statistics. We therefore limit ourselves to interpreting any significant hierarchical ordering of phase delays in terms of predominantly unidirectional (feedforward or feedback) coupling. We will present a simulation analysis of the effect of recurrent connections in a subsequent work. \n\nBy obtaining   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   and   seed-PLI-SPMs   using the same seeds of the V2 region and equal statistical thresholds, we showed that the clusters found to be connected to the V2 seeds by pairwise coherences were limited to the early visual system, were largely overlapped for the right and left hemispheres and were smaller compared to those detected by the 4 time-series analysis (Supplementary Figure  ). In contrast, major differences between the ventral and dorsal systems and between the hemispheres were found using the 4 time-series multivariate analysis (Figs   and  ). Furthermore, the average bivariate pairwise coherences’ strengths over all voxels of the V2_dorsal and V2_ventral seeds were found to be equal for all scales (Supplementary Figure  ). In contrast, the average multivariate 4 time-series coherence’s strengths over all voxels for networks of seed combination IV (and the other seed combinations) were found to be different between the ventral and the dorsal systems (Supplementary Figure  ). The dorsal system was shown to have lower coherence’s strength and the differences in strength were scale depended. The fact that such differences were only detected by the new analysis, suggests that it can distinguish between diverse coherence types that are not detectable by pairwise coherences. With regards to the reasons for dorsal coherence’s strength to be lower compared to ventral coherence’s strength, we note that in general coherence’s strength decreases as the phase-differences (between the time-series) increase. This is also evident from the observed scale dependency shown in Supplementary Figure  : Assuming a fixed or pseudo-fixed time-delay between time-series for the different scales, the corresponding phase-differences increase with scale. It remains to be explained why dorsal networks had larger phase-differences. At this level we can only speculate that the higher recurrent flow that is expected in the dorsal system resulted with an effective higher phase-differences. This issue will be further studied in the future. \n\nOne of the most pronounced finding was the higher number of networks for the dorsal system compared to the ventral system, where most of these were networks that connected visual and non-visual systems. This suggests that signal transfer between visual and non-visual regions has different characteristics in the ventral and dorsal systems. Indeed, multiple studies have shown faster signal flow in the dorsal compared to the ventral system . This fast flow in the dorsal system (the’magnocellular advantage’) was suggested to enable top-down influence of higher brain regions on visual processing and organization by multiple local and remote recurrent loops. We therefore suggest that the higher number of networks observed in the dorsal system is the result of faster neuronal flow in that system. \n\nThe number of networks in the left dorsal system for seed combinations 3 and 4 was found to be higher than in the right hemisphere. In these seed combinations, the last two seeds were V3_dorsal and a seed within the parietal cortex (the SP seed). The parietal cortex in the non-dominant hemisphere (right hemisphere of 77.5% of the subjects) is well known to be involved in visualization of spatial relationships and imagery as well as non-verbal memory. An injury to the parietal cortex in the non-dominant hemisphere might cause various “visual-related” clinical symptoms such as spatial disorientation, constructional apraxia including difficulties in dressing, drawing and navigating, loss of imagery and neglect of the left-side world including space and self. No such symptoms are related to parietal injuries in the dominant hemisphere (left hemisphere) where injury leads to non-visual symptoms such as Gerstmann syndrome, receptive aphasia and mathematical problems. Consequently, the right parietal lobe is thought to be more involved with visual processing. Although the intuitive assumption might be that the right hemisphere should have more visual networks, our data shows the opposite. Based on our findings, we claim that the more local and less distributed connectivity found in the right hemisphere compared to the left, implies higher sensitivity to visual deficits following injuries and therefore relates to the clinical symptoms described above. In other words, we suggest that the higher number of visual networks for the left hemispheres and their unspecific widespread distribution with multiple clusters that almost covered the whole cortex might reduce its sensitivity for visual deficits following injuries. Furthermore, the data suggests that these networks are feedforward pathways that include V3 and the parietal cortex, suggesting a strong dependency on hierarchical order (i.e. including all visual stages). \n\nOur results showed that the dorsal and ventral systems are functionally connected. Networks connecting the dorsal to the ventral systems were mainly of the left hemisphere with the connecting region in the superior parietal gyrus (seed 4). This is in line with several studies suggesting that information retro-injected from the parietal cortex is used to guide further processing of parvocellular and koniocellular information in the inferotemporal cortex . Much fewer networks were found to connect the ventral system to the dorsal system, suggesting that interaction between the two systems is predominantly from the dorsal system. \n\nFigure   presents the predominant direction of coupling found during resting-state acquisition with eyes open. As seen, although the majority of pathways in both streams were feedforward, major differences were found between the two streams. The directionality of the pathways shown in Fig.   is the direct consequence of the assumption of lower to higher processing and of low ↔ high hierarchal organization. However, the use of other assumptions (e.g. opposite directionality) will retain the major differences found between the dorsal and ventral systems. Within the assumption of lower to higher processing, almost all feedforward pathways of the dorsal system were connected to non-visual systems and initiated in the early visual stages (V1 and V2). In contrary, about half of the pathways in the ventral system were feedforward, all connected to non-visual systems and initiated in V2. Furthermore, all pathways that were confined to the striate and extrastriate cortices in the ventral system were feedback pathways that initiated in the fusiform gyrus while the few that were confined to these regions in the dorsal system were feedforward and initiated in V1. These findings demonstrate a major organization difference between the two streams. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe extended our novel multivariate analysis method to obtain directed functional pathways of BOLD signal progression within the brain. In contrast to most other connectivity analyses that are based on temporal similarity (i.e. connectivity strength), our analysis is based on the temporal order between multiple regions (i.e. coherences). We show that the new analysis contains more information compared with functional connectivity based on pairwise coherences since it discriminates between the two streams. Within the limitation of interpreting hierarchical ordering by means of phase delays in terms of unidirectional (feedforward or feedback) coupling, we show that the organizations of the ventral and dorsal systems are remarkably different. Whereas the dorsal system consisted of mainly feedforward pathways that included the striate, extrastriate cortices and non-visual regions, the ventral system included fewer pathways that were classified into two types: feedback pathways that initiated in the fusiform gyrus and either confined to the striate and extrastriate cortices or connected to the dorsal system, and feedforward pathways that initiated at V2 and included non-visual regions. Finally we note that the new analysis can be further extended to include more regions, applied on other neuroimaging data types (e.g. MEG) and thus open possibilities for characterization of complex neural systems. \n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThe same sample was used as in our previous publication . The sample was composed of 42 healthy control young subjects (20 women, age: 24.14 ± 2.67 years). Subjects were recruited among students at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Before inclusion, all subjects were clinically interviewed using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-CV) to exclude past or present psychiatric or neurological disorders. One male subject was excluded due to family history of schizophrenia and another male subject was excluded due to anxiety during the MRI scan, which yielded a final sample of 40 subjects (20 women, age: 24.15 ± 2.74 years). 13 men and 18 women were right handed. The study was approved by the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center Ethics Committee. All participants provided written informed consent prior to inclusion in the study in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nMagnetic resonance images were acquired with a 3T Siemens MR scanner at the Neuroimaging Unit of the Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Each participant underwent 10-minute of resting-state functional MRI during which they were instructed to fixate on a visual crosshair, remain still and awake. Immediately after the scan, each participant confirmed not falling asleep. Functional images were acquired using T -weighted gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) sequence with TR = 2 sec, TE = 30 ms, image matrix = 64 × 64, field of view = 192 × 192mm, flip angle = 90°, resolution = 3 × 3 × 3mm, interstice gap = 0.45 mm. Each brain volume comprised 30 axial slices, and each functional run contained 300 image volumes. High resolution anatomical images were acquired using a sagittal T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence with TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, inversion time = 900 ms, flip angle = 9°, resolution = 1x1x1mm. T1-weighted images were acquired for coregistration and normalization of the functional images. \n\n\n### Functional MRI data preprocessing and functional connectivity analysis \n  \nStandard initial preprocessing of functional MRI data was done using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, United Kingdom,  ). First, functional images were spatially realigned using a least squares approach and a six parameter (rigid body) spatial transformation. Subsequently, functional images were coregistered to high resolution T1 anatomical images, normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and resampled at an isotropic voxel size of 2 mm. The normalized images were smoothed with an isotropic 8 mm full-width-at-half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Motion parameter estimates were carefully checked for each individual separately. Subjects were excluded if head motion reached voxel size in any direction. Average maximal displacement for subjects was <1 mm. Further preprocessing was done using CONN toolbox . Censoring was done according to the method of Power   et al  . . Confounds were removed by regression, including the six motion parameters, their first order derivatives, scrubbing parameters and 3 principle components of the CSF and the white matter. Prior to regression of principal components, the white matter and CSF masks were eroded to ensure that only pure white matter or CSF signal was regressed from the data. Potential effects of scan initiation were removed by applying a step function convolved with the hemodynamic response function. Regression-out of confounds was done to minimize effects of motion and potential physiological and non-neuronal signals such as cardiac and respiratory signals, without the risk of artificially introducing anticorrelations into the functional connectivity estimates . Last, linear detrending and band-pass filtering (0.009-0.08 Hz) were applied. Note that a narrower frequency range was used compared to our previous publication, since previously most networks in the visual system were found in the lowest frequency range. \n\n\n### Multiple-region directed connectivity analysis \n  \nAll further calculations were performed with IDL version 8.2.0 (Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Inc.) using custom-developed software. The complex Morlet wavelet functions were chosen for wavelet analysis since they have been shown to provide a good trade-off between time and frequency localization . We used 3 for the smallest scale, 2 for the time resolution and 25 scales to cover the entire frequency window. Wavelet software was provided by C. Torrence and G. Compo available at: http://paos.colorado.edu/research/wavelets  . The 25 frequency scales were further averaged into 4 frequency scales: 0.01–0.03 Hz; 0.03–0.044 Hz; 0.047–0.067 Hz and 0.074–0.1 Hz. \n\n\n### Selection of brain regions \n  \nThe mask of Brodmann area 17 (primary visual area) obtained from the Talairach Daemon atlas  was manually divided to left and right hemispheres using MRIcron toolbox . The masks of Brodmann areas 18 (secondary visual area) and 19 (associative visual area) were manually divided to left, right, ventral and dorsal parts using the same toolbox. This resulted with a total of 10 masks: left and the right V1, left and right ventral V2, left and right dorsal V2, left and right ventral V3 and left and right dorsal V3. These masks were visually inspected to match the corresponding areas and no overlap was confirmed. Masks for the fourth seeds (for the ventral and dorsal systems) were obtained from the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   obtained by the first three seeds, to ensure their inclusion in the systems of interest. Brodmann masks rather than individualized ROIs were used to simplify the experiments and analysis and to minimize differences in seeds’s volumes between individuals. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \n#### CPI null distributions \n  \nTo define the significance of the Circular-Pattern-Indexes (CPI), permutation tests were used and the CPI’s null distributions were calculated for each CP and each scale. The null distributions were calculated as following: 4 time-series networks were constructed by 4 BOLD signals that were the average BOLD signals from different visual Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL)  regions, where each signal was taken from a different subject. These seeds where chosen from the visual system to obtain null distributions close as possible to the data. No randomization was used on the choice of the seeds. By using time-series from different subjects we guaranteed that no correlation between them is expected. For each network, functional connectivity (Equation  ) was calculated for each frequency separately and the phases were obtained according to Equation  . Averaging of the wavelet coefficients over time was performed before phase calculations. CPIs for the group of 40 subjects were calculated according to Equation  . Random number generator was used to select the subjects from which the time-series were taken. This process was repeated 10000 times and the CPIs were calculated each time. Consequently, 10000 numbers were obtained (for each CP and each scale). These numbers were used to construct the null distributions of each CP and each frequency. The distributions for the different CPs and different frequencies were approximately identical and therefore averaged together. Supplementary Figure   shows this average CPI’s null distribution. The distribution implies that CPI of 0.35 corresponded to an uncorrected voxel-level of p = 0.0001. This statistical cutoff was further used in all calculations. \n\n\n#### PLI null distributions \n  \nTo define the significance of the pairwise coherences used for comparison with the circular pattern analysis (see “Pairwise coherences of the visual system” section under results), we used the Phase Lag Index (PLI)  since it is more similar to the CPI than the phase locking value. Similarly to the CPI, significance was defined from the PLI’s null distributions that were calculated for each scale using permutation tests. The null distributions were calculated by using two uncoupled BOLD signals that were the average BOLD signals from two different visual AAL regions in different subjects (no randomization was used on these regions). Averaging over time of the wavelet coefficients was performed before PLI calculations. PLIs for the group of 40 subjects were calculated for each scale by the following equation: with Δ  φ   the phase-difference between the two BOLD signals of subject   n   at a specific time and frequency window. Random number generator was used to select patients from which time-series were taken. This process was repeated 10000 times and the PLIs were calculated each time. Consequently, 10000 numbers were obtained (for each scale). These numbers were used to construct the null distributions. The distributions for different scales were approximately identical and therefore were averaged together. Supplementary Figure   shows this average distribution. The distribution implies that PLI of 0.55 corresponded to an uncorrected voxel-level of p=0.0001. This statistical cutoff was used in the calculations. \n\n\n#### 3-seed-CPI -SPMs \n  \nTo obtain the statistical threshold of the   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   used in the circular-pattern calculations, a CPI uncorrected voxel-level p < 0.0001 and cluster-level threshold of 1000 voxels were used. This cluster size was chosen to ensure a corrected false discovery rate (FDR), given the number of multiple comparisons. Similar to fMRI analysis, the FDR corrected threshold was p < 0.001 which also correct for the multiple   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   calculations. \n\n\n#### Seed-PLI-SPMs \n  \nTo obtain the statistical threshold of the   seed-PLI-SPMs   used in the pairwise coherence calculations, a PLI uncorrected voxel-level p < 0.0001 with a cluster-level threshold of 1000 voxels were used. Together this gave a threshold of p < 0.001, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n#### Permutation based non-parametric tests for the number of networks in the dorsal system \n  \nTo test for differences in the number of networks between the right and left hemispheres, permutation based non-parametric statistics were used. For these comparisons, 50 pairs of pseudo groups each of 40 subjects were constructed. Each pseudo group included   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   calculated with seeds either in the left or right hemisphere (termed hereinafter “left SPM”, “right SPM”).   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   were calculated for seed combinations 1, 3 and 4. No tests were performed for seed combination 2 since the difference between left and right dorsal systems for this seed combination was neglectable. The number of left SPMs, within the group of 40 SPMs, was randomly selected with a distribution centered at 20. The number of right SPMs was 40 minus the number of the left SPMs. Pairs of such pseudo groups were constructed such that one group included N left SPMs and M right SPMs, while the other group included 40 minus N left SPMs and 40 minus M right SPMs, with no overlap of subjects between the groups.   3-seed-CPI   -SPMs   of these pseudo groups were calculated using the same calculations and statistical threshold as used in the actual data. The number of networks for each CP and scale was calculated for each pair. These yielded 50 sets of numbers (one set for each pair). The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the differences in the numbers of networks between the pseudo group pairs were calculated. The significant level was defined as mean ± 2*SD estimated at p < 0.05. \n\nAs expected, only networks of CP no. 4 (see results) were found significant in these calculations. Significant differences of the number of networks in the dorsal system between the left and right hemispheres were found for seed combinations 3 and 4. \n\n\n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"42961b543d48ed9e500fe9f96a472d64"},

In this study, differences in the epileptic brain functional connectivity states were explored through a network-based connectivity analysis between intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients and benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECT). Resting state fMRI imaging data were collected for 14 MTLE patients, 12 BECT patients and 16 healthy controls (HCs). Independent component analysis (ICA) was performed to identify the cortical functional networks. Subcortical nuclei of interest were extracted from the Harvard-Oxford probability atlas. Network-based statistics were used to detect functional connectivity (FC) alterations across intranetworks and internetworks, including the connectivity between cortical networks and subcortical nuclei. Compared with HCs, MTLE patients showed significant lower activity between the connectivity of cortical networks and subcortical nuclei (especially hippocampus) and lower internetwork FC involving the lateral temporal lobe; BECT patients showed normal cortical-subcortical FC with hyperconnectivity between cortical networks. Together, cortical-subcortical hypoconnectivity in MTLE suggested a low efficiency and collaborative network pattern, and this might be relevant to the final decompensatory state and the intractable prognosis. Conversely, cortical-subcortical region with normal connectivity remained well in global cooperativity, and compensatory internetwork hyperconnectivity caused by widespread cortical abnormal discharge, which might account for the self-limited clinical outcome in BECT. Based on the fMRI functional network study, different brain network patterns might provide a better explanation of mechanisms in different types of epilepsy. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEpilepsy derives from the long-term spontaneous abnormal discharge of neurons in the brain, resulting in hypersynchronization of the cortical-cortical and subcortical-cortical regions, thus leading to brain dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities. About 25% epilepsy patients with a dissatisfied clinical control of seizure even with the optimal anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) ( ). The most common drug-resistant epilepsy in adults is mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) ( ), accounting for 80% of temporal lobe onset seizures ( ). Inversely, some of the epilepsy patients have a good response to AEDs and even achieve a seizure-free result, such as benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECT). BECT is the most common form of childhood focal epilepsy and is usually idiopathic without structural brain abnormalities ( ). \n\nThe drug-resistance epilepsy might relate to brain decompensatory processes ( ) and self-limited epilepsy might contribute to compensatory cortical reorganization ( ,  ). Therefore, patients with MTLE and BECT might mark different prognosis by different brain compensatory patterns. The two patterns manifest brain networks abnormalities usually caused by epileptic discharges in widespread brain areas in MTLE and BECT. Thus, resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) could be used to detect the network -level epileptic effect. \n\nRoutine EEG examination and different imaging methods drive the conclusion that epilepsy is a network disease that is not only confined to the epileptogenic zones but also involved in widespread cortical and subcortical disturbances ( ,  ). Ictal EEG performance suggests that MTLE primarily involves the temporal lobes, and the abnormal network is known to have widespread extratemporal connectivity, such as the lateral temporal, insular, and frontal regions ( ,  ,  ). Imaging observations have suggested the presence of one or more common subcortical sources of widespread network dysfunction in MTLE. Hippocampal sclerosis is very significant and the most common pathological feature of MTLE. Moreover, the thalamus directly connected to the hippocampus has been shown to suffer atrophy ( ,  ). In addition, chronic network changes associated with MTLE have been identified by impaired RSFC within the hippocampus and enhanced RSFC within the medial temporal lobe with extensions to the lateral temporal lobes ( ,  ). \n\nIn the same vein, patients with BECT were found to have bilateral frontal and parieto-occipital regions that showed spectral changes in a resting-state EEG study ( ). A growing body of literature examining cognitive and behavioral outcomes by imaging methods suggests that BECTS children perform less well-than their peers ( ), including worse attention and visuomotor performance ( ,  ) and reversible speech and cognitive dysfunction ( ,  ). \n\nMTLE and BECT both suffer from neural abnormal discharges while their prognosis is obviously different. Moreover, alterations in the brain functional networks related to epileptic prognosis remain to be fully clarified, especially in the state of epileptic compensation. Thus, the fMRI approach was used to find the changes in functional networks and probably pathological mechanisms. We speculated that the network-based approach would be promising for revealing the complex network patterns to explain the mechanisms underlying the different prognosis in epilepsy. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFourteen MTLE patients and twelve BECT patients were recruited from the Epilepsy Clinic of Neurology and Neurosurgery Departments in Tianjin Medical University General Hospital. The diagnoses of MTLE and BECT were established by history, clinical symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and video electroencephalogram (VEEG) by 2 senior epileptologists (Q.Y. and Z.C.). The inclusion criteria for patients with MTLE and BECT were as follows: (1) typical clinical manifestations and specific EEG characteristics according to International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) ( ); (2) the presence of routine clinical scans, including high-resolution 3D T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI and high in-plane resolution 2D coronal T2-weighted MRI according to the Harmonized Neuroimaging Of Epilepsy Structural Sequences (HARNESS) ( ); (3) no evidence of other structural brain abnormalities due to hypoplasia of brain parenchyma, brain trauma, tumor, etc; and (4) MTLE patients should be diagnosed as the drugs resistance epilepsy ( ) and the patients with BECT should respond well to AEDs. Patients in both groups received oxcarbazepine/carbamazepine for seizures treatment. \n\nFor the lesion lateralization, there were 2 on right MTL and 3 on left MTL, and the rest of our drug-resistant MTLE patients were failed to detect the epileptogenic focus. And all of the BECT patients were bilateral abnormal discharges in EEG and we could not find the stationary focus on one side. Patient demographics and a clinical summary are shown in  . A healthy control group (  n   = 16) was matched by demographic characteristics from the local community. None of the HCs had a history of neurological or mental illness. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and completed according to the standards established in the Helsinki Declaration. Each subject gave written informed consent in accordance with the Hospital Research Ethics Committee. \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of all participants. \n  \n HCs, healthy controls; MTLE, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy; BECT, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes; SPS, simple partial seizure; CPS, complex partial seizure; SGTCS, secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure; BCT, bilateral centro-temporal; +CPT, BCT and centro-parieto-temporal; +CFT, BCT and centro-fronto-temporal; Sph1, left sphenoid electrode; Sph2, right sphenoid electrode  . \n  \n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nAll MRI scanning data were obtained on a 3-Tesla MRI scanner (Siemens Trio Tim). High-resolution T1-weighted data images were acquired using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (repetition time (TR) = 1,900 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.52 ms, field of view (FOV) = 256 mm × 256 mm, matrix 256 × 256, slice thickness 1 mm, 176 volumes). Resting-state functional blood oxygen level-dependent ( ) data images were acquired using an echo planar imaging sequence (TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle 90°, FOV = 220 mm × 220 mm, matrix 80 × 80, slice thickness 5 mm, 300 volumes). The patients were asked to not move and to stay with eyes closed and resting. Headphones and cushions were used to reduce noise interference and prevent excessive head movement. \n\n\n### Network-Based Functional MRI (fMRI) Analysis \n  \n#### Resting-State fMRI Preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing of the data was performed according to the Graph-theoretical Network Analysis Toolkit (GRETNA) ( ) fMRI preprocessing pipeline. The first 10 volumes were removed, and then slice-timing correction and head motion correction were performed. The data from patients with head motion exceeding 2 mm or head rotations <2° were excluded from further calculations, while head motion in controls was limited 1 mm or 1°,The motion-corrected functional images were normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space by applying an EPI template at a 3 × 3 × 3 mm  resolution, which led to our data showing a better match with the EPI template ( ). Subsequently, to avoid mixing white matter and gray matter signals, the normalized images were spatially smoothed using a 4-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel. The acquired smoothed data were utilized in independent component analysis (ICA). \n\nThe following denoising steps were performed with the unsmoothed images ( ): (1) removing the linear trends of time courses; (2) bandpass filtration (0.01–0.08 Hz) to minimize the influence of low-frequency drifts and high-frequency physiological noise; (3) linear regressing out the confounding signals that were unlikely to reflect neural activity, including the head motion effect ( ) (Friston 24 parameter), white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signals; and (4) an indispensable “scrubbing” procedure ( ). Concretely, in terms of the criteria of framewise displacement (FD) above 0.5 mm, functional imaging data presenting sudden head motion were discarded, together with one volume before and two volumes after the bad volume ( ). No patient had fewer than 200 volumes. BOLD signal differences of MTLE-HC and BECT-HC pair-wise contrasts were depicted by REST 18 toolbox ( ) to under two simple   t-  test (  p   < 0.05) with cluster sizes as 50 voxels, shown in  . \n  \nBOLD signal contrasts and seed regions from the 10 RSNs. BOLD signal of HC and MTLE was compared in   (A)  , and BECT-HC contrast in   (B)   (  p   < 0.05, cluster sizes: 50 voxels). Spatial maps of the 10 independent components computed across the entire samples. The color scale represents t values in each spatial component of RSN (maps thresholded at   p   < 0.01, FDR corrected). For networks construction, nodes of interest in the RSNs were extracted according to the peak coordinates of thresholding maps. Different RSNs were depicted as different colors in   (C)  . \n  \n\n#### Cortical Network Identification \n  \nRegions that exhibit correlated BOLD fluctuations, i.e., functional connectivity (FC), are regarded as the same functional network ( ). According to this theory, we used the group ICA (GICA) method to extract the spatial components of 10 defined resting state networks (RSNs). The Group ICA Of fMRI Toolbox was used for all participants for the group spatial ICA. The data were decomposed into 61 components that were estimated by GIFT, including data reduction by PCA, ICA separation, and back-reconstruction. Two-step PCA was used for data reduction. The maximum likelihood algorithm was used for group-level spatial ICA. A regular algorithm was used for stability analysis, and GICA was used for back-reconstruction. Each subject obtained a spatial component and the corresponding time-series component, and correlation coefficients were converted to a normal distribution by Fishers r-to-z transformation. For each component selection, we obeyed the selection criterion. In particular, ICA selection was independently completed by 2 senior neuroimaging physicians (J.Y. and A.A.) and referred to corresponding templates ( ). The spatial maps of each RSN were gathered across all the subjects by the intranetwork connectivity maximum for each cluster of voxels (  p   < 0.01, FDR corrected). The 10 statistic maps were   T  -value connectivity maps. We selected the total 38 ROIs in 10 RSNs based on where was the highest   T  -value in the bilateral sides. The methodology was according to King BR et al. ( ). For each local maximum, 38 regions of interest (ROIs) with a 6-mm radius sphere centered on the peak voxel were built with the xjView toolbox ( , version 9.6) and REST in MATLAB ( ). \n\n\n#### Subcortical Nucleus Identification \n  \nWe defined three core subcortical ROIs, the bilateral hippocampi, thalamus and putamen, based on the Harvard-Oxford subcortical atlas in MNI space ( ,  ). The subcortial ROIs selection criteria: hippocampus is crucial for MTLE pathological mechanism ( ) and putamen and thalamus are all key nuclei for patients with epilepsy. For local motor seizures, epileptogenic networks include thalamocortical circus ( ). And putamen is a core nucleus for basal ganglia neuromodulation for motor seizures treatment ( ). Therefore, we chose the 3 ROIs in subcortical. Because we did not focus on effects from particular sides of the ROIs, we regarded bilateral ROIs as one seed. In the current study, the hippocampus, putamen and thalamus are abbreviated Hip, Put and Tha, respectively. The selected subcortical ROIs are shown in  . Finally, we obtained 41 spatial mappings of RSNs and 41 average time series of ROIs. The brain networks were visualized with BrainNet Viewer ( , version 1.6). \n\n\n#### Intranetwork and Internetwork Analyses \n  \nThe corresponding time series of the ROI seeds were extracted with REST software, and RSFC in the BECT group, TLE group and HC group was calculated. We obtained three 41 × 41 RSFC matrices and performed Fishers z transformation. For completeness, plots depicting seed-level connectivity (i.e., 41 × 41 matrices) are provided in  . The significance level was set at   p   < 0.05 and corrected for multiple comparisons using network-based statistic (NBS) method ( ) (NBS, edge significance:   p   < 0.001, component significance:   p   < 0.05, iterations: 1,000). RSN matrices were acquired by averaging the NBS-corrected FC value (  p   < 0.05) in each group to generate 13 × 13 RSN matrices ( ). Cortical internetworks and cortical-subcortical interactions are shown in the off-diagonal line of the 13 × 13 RSN matrices. Intranetwork analysis results were revealed in the diagonal line and indicated the interaction between the inner seeds of each cortical network. \n\n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nDemographic information, including age and sex, was compared among the BECT, MTLE and HC groups. Seizure type and duration of epilepsy were compared between BECT and MTLE patients. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test discrepancies in age among the three groups. Chi-square tests were used to compare categorical data, such as sex among the three groups and seizure type distribution between the BECT and TLE groups. \n\nTwo-sample   t  -test was used to test the differences of duration between two patient groups. All the above analyses were performed in SPSS 25.0, and   p   < 0.05 was statistically significant. \n\nTen spatial components of thirty-eight seeds were chosen based on a one-sided one-sample   t  -test (  p   < 0.01, FDR corrected). Correlation maps for each seed in each RSN were computed by correlating regional time series (averaged over all voxels within the seed region) with every voxel in the brain. The 41 time courses, including 3 pairs of subcortical nuclei, were extracted to generate RSFC maps of the 41 × 41 matrix in the three groups. Correlation maps were converted to z maps using Fisher's r-to-z transformation ( ). Then, comparisons within each group were performed using one-sided one-sample   t  -tests (  p   < 0.05, NBS corrected) in GRETNA. For detecting intergroups differences, two sample   t  -test was used between MTLE/BECT and HC. And the age differences were taken into account in pairwise comparisons, and the level of significance for group differences was set at   p   < 0.05 (edge   p   < 0.001, NBS corrected). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Data \n  \nNo differences were found among the 3 groups in terms of gender (  p   = 0.951) and seizure type (  p   = 0.056) between the BECT and MTLE groups. For the analysis of duration, BECT shows significant different with MTLE group (  p   < 0.001). One-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference in age among the three groups (  p   < 0.001). A   post hoc   test was performed to find that the BECT-HC contrast (  p   < 0.001) and BECT-MTLE contrast (  p   < 0.001) were significant. The demographic and clinical information of the study participants is presented in  . \n\n\n### BOLD Signal Contrast and Resting State Networks \n  \nThe differences of BOLD signal between BECT-HC and MTLE-HC were shown in   (  p   < 0.05, cluster size: 50 voxels). A total of 61 components were identified by ICA. After selection by visual inspection and templates, 10 valuable components were identified. One-sample   t  -test showed a typical spatial pattern in each RSN and ROIs in each RSN are shown   and  . Spatial location of 38 ROIs were detailed in  . \n  \nResting state functional connectivity networks. \n  \n MNI coordinates and peak connectivity t value for the 38 seed regions extracted from the 10 networks of interest and labels and abbreviations based on the AAL template in MNI space. Ten RSNs were belonged to the following three types of intrinsic functional connectivity pattern: (1) task-positive RSNs (ECN, DAN and VAN); (2) intrinsic RSNs (DMN, SAN); (3) sensory RSNs (SMN, AN and VN). The DMN was subdivided into the anterior DMN (aDMN) and the posterior DMN (pDMN) in our outcomes. And SMN was divided into the medial SMN (mSMN) and the lateral SMN (lSMN)  . \n  \n\n### Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \n#### Internetwork Connectivity \n  \nOur findings showed different aberrations in network-based interactions in the MTLE ( ) and BECT ( ) groups. Compared with the HC group, the MTLE group had lower connectivity between the subcortical hippocampus and task-positive RSNs (ECN and DAN) and sensory RSN (SMN). Notably, the auditory network showed widespread abnormal connectivity with other functional networks, excluding the SMN ( ), which has been associated with impaired interictal connectivity with the temporal neocortex. \n  \nPairwise comparisons of Internetwork connectivity aberration. Values represented t-statistics between 10 networks and 3 subcortical regions of interest (ROIs: bilateral hippocampus, putamen and thalamus) in the pairwise comparisons of MTLE- HC (  A, C  ) and BECT- HC   (B, D)  . Tests of statistical significance were based on two-sample   t  -test corrected for multiple comparisons with a network-based statistic (NBS) threshold set to 0.05. Thredsholded edges and nodes corresponded results of internetwork connectivity   (A, B)  . Specially, we used AAL coordinates to symbolically depict the subcortical ROIs. To better elucidate the general trend, matrix maps were used   (C, D)  . Significant differences are also marked by yellow circuses in the connectivity matrices. The black rectangular box highlighted the characteristic networks, AN in MTLE-HC and lSMN in BECT-HC (details as shown in  ). \n  \nThe BECT group showed increased connectivity in the frontoparietal cortex, including the intrinsic RSNs, task-positive RSNs and sensory RSNs (  p   < 0.05, NBS corrected). The SMN showed an increased negative (farther from zero) connectivity with the attention networks (DAN and VAN) and VN ( ), indicating a relationship to visual attention deficit. Importantly, no particular differences in connectivity were revealed between the cortical networks and the subcortical ROIs, but a trend toward higher interconnectivity was observed (  p   > 0.05, NBS corrected). \n\n\n#### Intranetwork Connectivity \n  \nNo differences were found between the MTLE and BECT patients and the HC participants through a two-sample   t  -test. Some critical trends in intranetwork connectivity were revealed in each group. In the MTLE group, intranetwork connectivity was not different from that in the HC group, with the exception of the AN in the lateral temporal lobe. The BECT group showed higher levels of connectivity within most RSNs, such as the SN, pDMN, ECN and DAN (  Figure 4  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nA comparative study of epilepsy compensatory and decompensatory prognosis was conducted in this research. We recruited the patients with BECT and MTLE, the most common types of benign and drug-resistant epilepsies. With the utility of a network-based approach, we demonstrated the different network pattern changes caused by compensation and decompensation, and we also uncovered meaningful networks in a wide range of brain areas with implications for cognitive function. \n\n### RSN Alterations in Patients With MTLE \n  \nThe current study found that RSNs in the MTLE patients compared with the HCs had lower connectivity with subcortical ROIs, especially the hippocampus, which plays a core role in MTLE. The abnormal connectivity patterns of these networks with the hippocampus were related to functional and structural impairments in the hippocampus. Deactivation compared to the control condition corresponded to decreased synaptic activity, such as that caused by reduced neuronal input from the hippocampus ( ). In current study, the condition of impaired consciousness in most patients with MTLE (13/14) might have been caused by subcortical networks with extensive impairments in connectivity with the cortical functional networks ( ). These abnormal connections occurred with both task-positive networks and sensory networks. Task-positive networks (e.g., ECN, DAN, and VAN) are dominant in executive control and external attention. Sensory networks are primarily involved in primary somatomotor, somatosensory, visual and auditory processes. Our findings accorded with earlier observations, which showed that MTLE patients demonstrated diffuse neocortical hypometabolism and multitudinous brain connectivity perturbations ( ). \n\nThe AN showed higher connectivity with other widespread RSNs, including the DMN, which could be explained by the reconfiguration in the lateral temporal area in MTLE patients ( ). Blumenfeld and his colleagues used SPECT ( ) and found that ictal TLE patients had increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the temporal lobe, as well as an increase in CBF in bilateral midline subcortical structures. CBF activity coherence was interpreted as a BOLD signal effect between the lateral temporal and midline areas, manifested as a higher connectivity compared with HCs (see  ). Thus, damage to lateral temporal lobes, one of the functional network hubs, will affect the sets of functional brain areas at large ( ). \n  \nStrongly characteristic networks in MTLE and BECT. We detailed the black rectangular boxes in  , AN in MTLE-HC and lSMN in BECT-HC. In the analysis of pairwise seed connectivity, bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) were found hyperconnectivity with almost functional networks in MTLE-HC   (A)  . Bilateral postcentral gyrus (ProCG.L and ProCG.R) and right Rolandic operculum (ROL.R) showed hypoconnectivity with right intraparietal sulcus (SPG.R within DAN) and left temporoparietal junction (SMG.L within VAN)   (B)  . Tests of statistical significance were based on two-sample   t  -tests (  p   < 0.05, NBS corrected). \n  \n\n### RSN Alterations in Patients With BECT \n  \nA resting-state BOLD response was demonstrated to be consistent with interictal seizure discharges in the rolandic region in an EEG-fMRI study ( ). Initial studies have shown that the areas of increased connectivity and activity are usually the sensorimotor cortex and immediate regions surrounding the zone. Therefore, a network-based approach may expand our traditional knowledge about the organization of the sensorimotor cortex, especially the interaction between the motor system and the rest of the networks. \n\nThe network we refer to as “rolandic” has usually been recognized as a sensorimotor network (SMN) in large-scale RSNs. Effective connectivity studies have suggested that the rolandic area is the key region for the spread of interictal epileptic spikes to distal cortical regions. However, the effect of the rolandic regions is based on the regional distribution of its connectivity among the sets of functional brain areas. Consistent with the research, several studies have found that participants who reported using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and fMRI also detected a decreased oxyhaemoglobin (HbO) response and an increased deoxyhaemoglobin (HbR) response in the frontal and parieto-occipital lobes, indicating a widespread effect across distributed networks ( ,  ). \n\nSimilar findings of discrepant intranetwork connectivity have been previously reported ( ,  ), although the current results were not significant compared with the HC group ( ). It was difficult to explain this result, but it might be related to a stronger regional integration ( ) in BECT patients. Regardless, there was higher internetwork connectivity among an extensive range of networks, such as the DMN and SAN with other sensory networks (  p   < 0.05, NBS corrected), which corresponded to the loss of cortical global processing ( ). In the network-based analysis, excitatory local and global networks indicated that the small-world functional topology was disrupted in BECT patients ( ). Notably, no marked lower or higher FC was found between cortical RSNs and subcortical ROIs, which indicated that subcortical core nuclei were not involved in the alterations. \n  \nRadar plots showing intranetwork RSFC differences in each group. The values displayed by the dots in the radar plots are the Fisher z-transformed values of Pearson's correlation in each group, and a table of the values is provided in  . In the white area, node-edge graphs of 10 RSNs were showed according to  . \n  \nIn addition, we uncovered a decreased RSFC between the SMN and attention networks in the hyperconnectivity setting (see  ) (  p   < 0.05, NBS corrected). The SMN is a motor network as demonstrated in previous studies but is also partially integrated into a multimodal network associated with motor systems and cognitive hubs ( ). Impacts on cognition were shown by Caterina et al., who found that BECT patients had impairments in attention ( ). Attention control deficits have been related to alterations in the DAN and VAN. A previous study showed increased FC within the VAN in patients when compared with controls ( ). This finding was also supported by Jiang et al., who found that children newly diagnosed with BECT showed alterations in brain activity in the attention networks, and the unmedicated group showed increased RSFC in the rolandic network and decreased RSFC in the DAN ( ). These findings were in line with attention dysfunction in BECT patients (see  ). Moreover, the decreased connectivity between the VN and SMN can explain the poor visual spatial memory observed in BECT children ( ,  ), which manifests as a loss in integration of the motor network and visual network that forms a multimodal network ( ). Moreover, the VN was shown to have a strong correlation with the DMN, indicating that BECT was characterized by possible functional compensatory mechanisms ( ) and related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \n\nConsidering the age differences between BECT group (10.42 ± 4.5) and HC group (27.1 ± 4.8), characteristics of RSNs in heathy children and adults were also needed to be discussed as it might influence the results' interpretation to some degree. Resting state studies have shown that children have the same RSNs as adults' and children round 8 years old have strong functional organization, but exhibit immature characteristics ( ,  ). Compared with adults, this immature performance was characterized by the functional segregation and the insufficient integration ( ,  ). And structure network studies suggested that the approach of network interaction changed from local anatomically regions in children to long-distance cortical interaction in young adults ( ,  ). A study of the size of functional networks was found that the number of voxels were more than adults in the majority RSNs and also more widespread ( ). In conclusion, it is demonstrated that this kind of segregative pattern in children is less efficient or specialized than adult ( ). However, a principle finding in RSNs development was that SMN increased the efficiency of local and global functional connectivity with aging ( ,  ). In the current study, BECT patients suffered from the epileptic neural activity in Rolandic area, which could be the reason why healthy adult subjects showed a lower connectivity compared with BECT children. Hence, our primary result was not be interrupted by the age differences. \n\n\n### Differences in RSNs in Patients With MTLE and BECT \n  \nIn the internetwork analysis, it was notable that network state differences between the MTLE and BECT patients showed hypoconnectivity between cortical networks and subcortical ROIs in a general setting of lower connectivity in MTLE contrasted against normal cortical-subcortical connectivity and extensive hyperconnectivity among the majority of networks in BECT. This suggested that the two types of epilepsy have completely different brain network patterns that impact clinical outcomes. In our study, patients with MTLE and BECT have totally different severity of clinical manifestations. One of the critical reasons is because the different pathological mechanism. Generally, patients with MTLE have the most common etiology and pathological performance, hippocampus sclerosis, which is irreversible in the course of epilepsy ( ). By comparison, BECT is an idiopathic epilepsy without brain structural abnormality and recently research have shown a strong correlation between genetics and BECT development ( ). Moreover, different durations of two patient groups were also contributed to different clinical response. Long-term epileptiform discharges would be able to interrupt the brain normal functional activity and also induced structural damage in MTLE ( ) while majority of BECT patients remit spontaneously before adolescence. \n\nConnectivity patterns seem to be correlated with the duration and severity of the disease, indicating progressive connectivity reorganization in the context of recurrent seizure activity. BECT was more reflective of a state of increased synchronization in functional network activities, which could be understood as synchronous activity of these related regions that did not stop during the interictal period. Hence, it could conceivably be regarded as a compensatory state of higher synchronization. Moreover, normal cortical-subcortical interactions suggested disruptions confined to cortical functional regions in BECT. In contrast, the MTLE patients showed a widespread state of lower connectivity between RSNs and subcortical ROIs compared with the HCs, which meant a lower global cooperativity that should have relevant functional consequences due to the loss of their normal FC. It could be concluded that MTLE results in more significant disruptions throughout brain networks, and this may help to explain the longer course of the disease, more severe symptoms and worse prognosis of MTLE than BECT through a pathological network mechanism. \n\nWe provide new evidence for brain network pattern abnormalities in different epilepsy compensatory states. And we expect that future studies will focus more on the lateral temporal lobes in MTLE and the attention networks in BECT. Furthermore, it seems feasible to use different neuromodulation approaches, for example, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to investigate these underpinning mechanisms. Michael D. Fox and his colleagues ( ) suggested the potential to balance abnormal activity based on RSFC in psychiatric and neurological diseases, including epilepsy ( ,  ). Network-based cortical modulation in BECT and MTLE, as typical focal epilepsies, might have the potential to investigate the substrate. Concretely, our findings suggested that the lateral temporal lobes and attention networks are probably valid TMS targets for MTLE and BECT. In addition, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and other network-based neuromodulation methods, which take these variables into account, will need to be undertaken. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nIn the current study, our primary focus was on the discrepant state and characteristics of brain functional networks in patients with MTLE and BECT. However, the study findings should be interpreted in the context of their limitations. Firstly, a potential limitation of our study was the small sample size in both epilepsy groups. A larger sample size may produce significant results when the MTLE and BECT groups are compared with the HC group in the intranetwork analysis. Secondly, in our future study, the age discrepancy between BECT and HC needed to be further solved. Thirdly, cognitive state evaluation, such as attention, motion, audition and visual function, is necessary as a Supplementary to verify these dysfunctions. Finally, there is more detailed and related work that could be performed, including effective connectivity and global property analysis in future studies. Future work is required for a full consideration of the above factors. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions generated for the study are included in the article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nJY and CF: conceptualization.

The BOLD response follows neuronal activity, when changes in the relative concentration of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin cause fluctuations in the MRI T2* signal. Since the BOLD signal detects changes in relative concentrations of oxy/deoxy-haemoglobin, individual differences in haemoglobin levels may influence the BOLD signal-to-noise ratio in a manner independent of the degree of neural activity. In this study, we examined whether group differences in haemoglobin may confound measures of functional connectivity. We investigated whether relationships between measures of functional connectivity and cognitive performance could be influenced by individual variability in haemoglobin. Finally, we mapped the neuroanatomical distribution of the influence of haemoglobin on functional connectivity to determine where group differences in functional connectivity are manifest. \n\nIn a cohort of 518 healthy elderly subjects (259 men), each sex group was median-split into two groups with high and low haemoglobin concentration. Significant differences were obtained in functional connectivity between the high and low haemoglobin groups for both men and women (Cohen’s d 0.17 and 0.03 for men and women respectively). The haemoglobin connectome in males showed a widespread systematic increase in functional connectivity correlation values, whilst the female connectome showed predominantly parietal and subcortical increases and temporo-parietal decreases. Despite the haemoglobin groups having no differences in cognitive measures, significant differences in the linear relationships between cognitive performance and functional connectivity were obtained for all 5 cognitive tests in males, and 4 out of 5 tests in females. \n\nOur findings confirm that individual variability in haemoglobin levels that give rise to group differences are an important confounding variable in BOLD-fMRI-based studies of functional connectivity. Controlling for haemoglobin variability as a potentially confounding variable is crucial to ensure the reproducibility of human brain connectome studies, especially in studies that compare groups of individuals, compare sexes, or examine connectivity-cognition relationships. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFunctional connectivity refers to statistical dependencies between spatially distinct neurophysiological signals ( ), and can be estimated in humans at a whole-brain level using blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Many studies measure functional connectivity using task-free resting-state BOLD fMRI data ( ;  ), otherwise known as resting-state functional connectivity. Numerous studies have demonstrated that resting-state functional connectivity is associated with variability in cognition ( ;  ), age ( ), sex ( ;  ), genetics ( ;  ), psychiatric conditions ( ;  ;  ), and neurodegeneration (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease,  ). \n\nMeasures of functional connectivity depend on temporal fluctuations in the BOLD signal. Changes to the relative concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin in a brain region cause fluctuations to the MRI T2* signal, giving rise to the BOLD effect ( ). The BOLD signal therefore provides an indirect measure of brain function arising from the neurovascular coupling between neuronal activity and cerebral haemodynamics ( ). As described by Liu ( ), the relative signal change in BOLD-fMRI is given as\n \nwhere   S(t)   denotes the signal acquired at time   t  , R* (t) is the apparent transverse relaxation rate,   TE   denotes the echo time,   S   (t)   is the magnetisation at TE = 0, and   n(t)   represents additive background noise. Thus, the relative change in signal is the sum of three terms: (i),the relative change in transverse magnetisation at zero echo time  ; (ii), the change in relaxation rate  ; and (iii) the background noise   which is influenced by thermal noise, radiofrequency (RF) interference, etc. BOLD-fMRI experiments are typically designed to measure the relaxation term as an indirect index of functional brain activity. \n\nThere are several factors of non-neuronal origin that can influence the relative concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin in the cerebrovasculature, which can contribute to changes in the BOLD signal. These factors include heart-rate variability, respiration, and head movement ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ), all of which can cause temporal correlations of the fMRI signal between brain regions. The modelling and removal of these signals continues to be an active area of research (e.g.,  ). \n\nIn addition to respiratory, cardiac and head movement factors, there are other non-neuronal factors that directly influence the BOLD signal, including the maximum oxygen carrying capacity of the blood ( ;  ). This capacity is related to the amount and the fractional volume of red blood cells in the blood. Haemoglobin is the metalloprotein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissue, and returns carbon dioxide from the tissue back to the lungs. Haematocrit is the volume proportion of red blood cells to whole blood volume and is usually expressed as a percentage. Haemoglobin and haematocrit are highly correlated (haematocrit is often defined as three times the value of haemoglobin), but are not identical. Haemoglobin measures are more stable to plasma volume changes, such as in dehydration ( ). Haemoglobin and haematocrit levels vary considerably between individuals; and systematically between the sexes, with men generally showing haematocrit levels of 42–49%, and women 39–46% (e.g.,  ). Whilst haemoglobin and haematocrit levels within subjects are not thought to vary within an MRI scan session (unlike head motion or breathing rate), they are still able to influence the BOLD signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of the acquired data. This source of variability in BOLD signal (and SNR) across subjects has the potential to influence measures of functional connectivity, particularly for analyses that examine individual variability in connectivity and differences between groups of individuals. In fact, inter-subject variation in haematocrit has been found to correlate with the degree of centrality of fMRI networks ( ), to mediate the magnitude of the BOLD response in the visual cortex ( ;  ), and to mediate the BOLD signal intensity in other forms of oxygenation-sensitive imaging, including the cardiac BOLD response ( ). \n\nDependence of the BOLD signal on haematocrit level is particularly important for studies where haemoglobin and/or haematocrit may differ between study groups. Several factors have been found to correlate with haemoglobin differences, including sex ( ), age ( ), race ( ), hydration level ( ), stress levels ( ;  ;  ), body temperature ( ), sleep apnoea ( ), cardiovascular health ( ), and testosterone administration ( ). These factors influence haemoglobin, and so may also indirectly influence fMRI functional connectivity analyses between groups and confound the results and interpretation of the findings. \n\nIn this study, we examined the potential for haemoglobin to be a confounding variable in functional connectivity analyses in a group of healthy elderly individuals. Ageing is associated with a number of physiological changes that may impact the BOLD signal ( ), and inter-individual variability in haemoglobin levels increases across the lifespan (Hawkins et al., 1954). We specifically aimed to test whether between-group haemoglobin differences could systematically bias between-group differences in functional connectomes, and whether individual variation in haemoglobin could impact the relationships between functional connectivity and measures of cognition in group studies. We predicted that groups selected by haemoglobin levels would exhibit differences in both functional connectivity and connectivity-cognition relationships. \n\nGiven the significant known differences in haemoglobin between the sexes ( ), analyses were performed separately for men and women. The cohort was additionally split into two groups, divided into the lower 50% and upper 50% of individuals based upon haemoglobin values. We tested for differences in cognitive performance between the two groups to ensure functional connectivity differences were not due to differences in cognitive performance. We compared the functional connectivity matrices between the groups to identify whether there were effects of haemoglobin on the strength of global or regional functional connectivity measures. We examined whether the effect was global, and therefore an intrinsic property of the BOLD signal, or anatomically localized to specific brain networks, especially those networks with relatively high venous cerebrovascular vessel density. Finally, we examined the effect of haemoglobin variability on connectivity-cognition relationships, by correlating functional connectivity with cognitive performance and testing whether the correlations differed between the two haemoglobin groups. We hypothesised that significant differences would be observed between functional connectivity of the upper and lower haemoglobin groups, that these differences would persist in connectivity-cognition analyses, and could produce potentially spurious findings between the connectivity matrices of two otherwise comparable groups of healthy people. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis data was acquired by the ASPREE Investigator Group, under the ASPREE-Neuro sub-study. We refer the reader to the ASPREE-Neuro clinical trial protocol paper ( ) for full study parameters. The data that support the findings of this study are available from ASPREE International Investigator Group, but restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current study, and so are not publicly available. Data are however available from the authors upon reasonable request and with permission of ASPREE International Investigator Group ( ). \n\nAll methods for the ASPREE-Neuro clinical trial were reviewed by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee, in accordance with the Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007). \n\n### Participants \n  \nData formed part of the baseline (i.e., premedication) cohort of the ASPREE trial, a multicentre, randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of daily 100 mg aspirin in 19,000 healthy community dwelling older adults in Australia and the United States. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the ASPREE trial have been published previously ( ). Participants were eligible in Australia if aged 70-years and over, no past history of occlusive vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, cognitive impairment or disability, were not taking antithrombotic therapy, and did not have anaemia or diagnosis of a conditions likely to cause death in the following five years. Baseline characteristics of the full ASPREE sample have been reported previously ( ). The current study used data from 518 participants (age = 73.8 ± 3.5, 248 females) from the ASPREE-Neuro sub-study ( ). At study entry, ASPREE-Neuro participants had a Modified Mini Mental Status Examination (3MS) ( ) score of at least 78/100. All MRIs used in this study were acquired before study medication was taken. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nFull protocol details are available in the ASPREE-Neuro sub-study protocol ( ). Here, we include haemoglobin, cognitive and MRI data from the baseline time-point, prior to the administration of study medication. \n\n#### Haemoglobin \n  \nFasting blood was collected at a lifestyle profile and screening assessment and sent to a pathology laboratory for testing. Haemoglobin was measured in g/dL. To comply with the ASPREE trial inclusion criteria (ASPREE Investigator  ), individuals were screened from study entry if their haemoglobin was below 11 g/dL for females or 12 g/dL for males. \n\nThe cohort was separated into low-haemoglobin (‘low-Hb’) and high haemoglobin (‘high-Hb’) groups using a median split (lower and upper 50%) separated by sex. This resulted in four groups: low-Hb female, low-Hb male, high-Hb female, and high-Hb male. For females, the median was 13.8, and for males the median was 14.9. Histograms of haemoglobin distribution in this sample are shown in  . \n\n\n#### Cognitive tests \n  \nThe five cognitive tests used were: (i) single-letter controlled oral word association test (COWAT) ( ); (ii) colour trails test ( ); (iii) predicted score derived from the modified mini-mental state examination (3MS); (iv) symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) ( ); and (v) the Victoria Stroop test ( ). Performance on each test was normalised (z-scored) separately for females and males. \n\n\n#### Imaging \n  \nMRI data were acquired using a 3T Skyra MRI scanner equipped with a 32-channel head and neck coil (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). In this study, we used resting-state BOLD-fMRI and T1-weighted structural MRI data. The fMRI protocol was an eyes-open resting-state multi-band EPI sequence (multiband factor=3, TE=21 ms, TR=754 ms, voxel=3.0 mm isotropic, matrix 64 × 64, slices=42). A T1-weighted MPRAGE scan was acquired for registration (TE=2.13 ms, TR=2300 ms, TI=900 ms, voxel=1.0 mm isotropic, matrix=240 × 256 × 192, flip angle=9°). fMR images were corrected for geometry distortions (FUGUE) and brain extracted (BET) ( ). Intra-scan movements were corrected using 3dvolreg; both high frequencies (above 0.1 Hz) and the temporal mean (and first- and second-order polynomials) were removed from each voxel’s time series using 3dTproject (AFNI) ( ). Filtered images were entered into a first-level independent component analysis (ICA) with automatic estimation of the number of components using MELODIC ( ). All the extracted ICA maps were then automatically labelled by FSL-FIX ( ), which was previously manually trained on 25 random subjects. Temporal trends from noise-labelled ICA components were linearly regressed out of the 4D MR images using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression as implemented in FSL FIX. The cleaned images were then normalized to the MNI template (2 mm isotropic resolution); the first volume of the EPI time series was registered to the T1-weighted image using linear registration (with 6 degrees of freedom). Each T1 was then non-linearly registered to the MNI template using the symmetric normalization algorithm in ANTs ( ). The brain was parcellated into 82 regions using the Desikan-Killiany atlas ( ;  ). The last step was to apply all the transformations from the previous two points to the 4D cleaned file. Finally, the normalized cleaned file was smoothed with a 5 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n#### Calculation of functional connectivity matrix \n  \nfMRI timeseries were extracted from each of the 82 Desikan-Killiany regions for each individual. An individual functional connectivity matrix was calculated as an 82 × 82 correlation matrix, formed by calculating temporal correlations (Pearson) between each pair of regions. A single entry in the correlation matrix is referred to as an edge in the connectivity matrix; each region denotes a node. The correlation between a region and itself is always unity, and thus the diagonals values of the matrix are not included in statistical tests. Once symmetry (a factor of 2) and the diagonals are removed, 3321 edges remained. Group-level connectivity matrices were computed by averaging edges across subjects within groups. \n\n\n#### Group-level assessment of haemoglobin on the functional connectivity matrix \n  \nAll analyses were performed separately for males and females to mitigate the confounding effects of haemoglobin differences associated with sex ( ). The effect size of functional connectivity differences between two subgroups for each sex (median split on haemoglobin values) was quantified by calculating Cohen’s d ( ) for each edge in the 82 × 82 correlation matrix. Two subgroup connectivity matrices for each sex were calculated taking the mean edge-weight across individuals in the low-Hb and high-Hb sub-groups (divided by the median haemoglobin value) and the subgroup-level matrices were compared using Cohen’s  -statistic \n\n\n#### Origins of the haemoglobin influence \n  \nFurther analysis was performed to assess whether the effect of haemoglobin on the functional connectivity matrix was due to neurovascular effects, and potentially biased towards the neuroanatomical location of the draining blood vessels. A general linear model for each edge in the matrix was fit to infer a relationship between haemoglobin (Hb) and functional connectivity (FC), covarying for age. \n\nHaemoglobin values were normalised (z-scored) using a separate mean and standard-deviation for females and males to avoid previously reported biases ( ) prior to fitting the linear models. This model was fit using the whole cohort, i.e., not split into high and low haemoglobin groups. \n\nThe distribution of the t-scores for the linear coefficients (B ) and explained variance of the entire model (R-squared) were compared to a null model where the Hb, FC and age data were randomly permuted, and the models refit at each edge. The distribution for the null model was the composite of t-scores and explained variance from 500 permutations. We calculated an edge-wise p-value from the number of permutations with higher t-score values. \n\nTo determine whether the proximity of brain regions to cerebrovenous vasculature influenced the relationship between haemoglobin and functional connectivity, the location of the strongest associations were compared to an atlas of the cerebral veins ( ). For each sex, a ‘haemoglobin connectome’ was constructed with edges to represent the top 10% of linear coefficients (t-values). The number of edges connecting each node was then calculated (network degree) to determine which regions of the brain gave rise to the strongest haemoglobin-functional connectivity associations. These highly connected regions were then spatially compared to the probabilistic map of the location of the cerebral veins ( ). \n\n\n#### Impact of haemoglobin on connectivity-cognition analyses \n  \nTo investigate how group-differences in haemoglobin may influence brain connectivity-cognition relationships, the relationships between cognitive performance and functional connectivity were compared between the two subgroups (low-Hb and high-Hb) for each sex. Thus, in the comparison of low-Hb versus high-Hb groups within each sex, the mean haemoglobin values are the only between-group difference. The two haemoglobin subgroups for each sex had no differences in cognitive performance for either the male or female groups (see  ). \n\nA linear model was calculated between functional connectivity (FC) and task performance (Cog), covarying for age, for each of the five tasks, for each edge in the connectivity matrix. \n\nThe linear coefficients (B ) of the lower-Hb and upper-Hb subgroups were compared to measure the effect of subgrouping on haemoglobin using a Cohen’s d statistic. To assess the effect of haemoglobin, the results were compared with linear coefficients estimated from the entire cohort (low-Hb and high-Hb combined). The likelihood of observing a similar or larger effect by chance (p-value) was calculated by permuting the low-Hb/high-Hb group membership 1000 times and comparing the observed effect size to this distribution of effect sizes. \n\nFunctional connectivity and cognitive performance were normalised (z-scored) prior to fitting the models. All normalisation and statistical analyses were performed separately for females and males. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Group-level assessment of haemoglobin on the functional connectivity matrix \n  \nGroup-level functional connectivity matrices differed significantly between the low-Hb and high-Hb sub-groups for both men and women (  t  -test   p  <10 ). The size of this effect at a global level was small (Cohen’s d men=0.17 women=0.03). In males, the edge-weights of the functional connectivity matrix in the high-Hb subgroup were consistently higher than in low-Hb subgroup ( ) with effect sizes as high as 0.4. For men, 88% of the edge-weights were higher in high-Hb compared to low-Hb subjects, with 12% having higher edge-weights in the low-Hb compared to the high-Hb subjects. In females, there was less systematic bias between the subgroup matrix edge weights with 59% higher in the high-Hb compared to the low-Hb subgroup, with 41% higher in the low-Hb subgroup than high-Hb subgroup. The strength of the global haemoglobin effect between sex subgroups was less in females compared to males ( ). \n\n\n### Origins of the haemoglobin influence \n  \nLinear coefficients between haemoglobin and edge-weights in the functional connectivity matrix were calculated and compared to a null distribution of randomly permuted haemoglobin, functional connectivity and age data. In men, the linear coefficients ( .) and explained variance ( .) were linearly biased relative to the randomly permuted dataset. The likelihood of this bias is depicted in   and compared to the expectation of a null model. Relative to the null model, the haemoglobin model had a horizontal shift in linear coefficient, and strongly non-uniform p-value distribution. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that the haemoglobin results are unlikely to be false-positives. The bias in the linear coefficient results from an increase in the explained variance, as evident by the increase of the explained variance in the haemoglobin model in  . This was not the case in the female group, where the distribution of the linear coefficients between haemoglobin and functional connectivity edge-weights overlapped the null distribution ( ). \n\nTo determine if the haemoglobin influence on functional connectivity values was related to the proximity to cerebral veins, a map of the highest haemoglobin functional connectivity associations was compared with an atlas of the cerebral veins ( ).   shows the spatial map of the top 10%   t   coefficients, and the probabilistic location of the major draining veins ( ). The strongest correlations between haemoglobin and functional connectivity were not found in close proximity to cerebral veins. Note that spatial maps at different thresholds are shown in   and are consistent with these results, indicating that this result is robust to different thresholds. Visual inspection of   suggests there was a trend towards higher associations in the right hemisphere in both males and females, most pronounced in the sub-cortical regions. \n\n\n### Impact of haemoglobin on connectivity-cognition analyses \n  \nThere were no significant differences in cognitive performance between the low-Hb and high-Hb subgroups (  t  -test   p  >0.36 for all tests and both sexes).   shows box-plots for low-Hb and high-Hb groups for each sex. \n\nLinear coefficients of cognitive test performance and edge-weights in the functional connectivity matrix were compared between the low-Hb and high-Hb subgroups ( ). In females, the coefficients were significantly different (  p  <0.001) in three out of the four cognitive tests examined. In males, the coefficients were significantly different (  p  <0.001) in all four cognitive tests. \n\nLinear coefficients between functional connectivity and cognitive performance were consistently lower in the low-Hb subgroup compared to the high-Hb subgroup ( ). The effect was present in both males and females. Matrix edges that showed no significant correlation between cognitive performance and functional connectivity (where the black line approached the zero line) still demonstrated a haemoglobin-related bias. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe BOLD signal originates in the blood, so it is therefore not surprising that group and individual differences in haemoglobin levels are an important confounding variable in BOLD-fMRI-based studies of functional connectivity. The results of this study demonstrate that the confounding effect of variability in haemoglobin values is widespread across brain regions, differs substantially between the sexes, and strongly influences functional connectivity-cognition relationships. The effect of haemoglobin on functional connectivity measures was widespread across brain regions in males without particular neuroanatomical specificity. In females, the effect was weaker than that in the males: it varied across the brain, with subcortical regions in particular showing higher functional connectivity in the high-Hb subgroup compared to the low-Hb subgroup. Females also showed regionally specific higher functional connectivity in the low-Hb compared to the high-Hb subgroup, particularly in parietal and temporal regions. Elevated associations between haemoglobin and functional connectivity evident in the orbitofrontal cortex are difficult to interpret due to their proximity to known susceptibility-related distortions ( ) and lateralization. These results demonstrate that BOLD-fMRI functional connectivity analyses are confounded by haemoglobin differences, especially in studies aiming to compare groups of individuals, or between sexes. \n\nIn addition to the significant effect of haemoglobin on functional connectivity, we also found that cognition-connectivity relationships were substantially impacted by haemoglobin levels. These results showed that there are systematically higher correlations of cognitive measures with resting-state connectivity for individuals with higher haemoglobin levels, and that this effect is spatially-non-specific, and occurs across the brain. Thus, the influence of haemoglobin variability is not confined to any one individual cognitive measure, or any single brain region (e.g., close to cerebral veins). These results suggest that care should be taken when interpreting connectivity-cognition relationships calculated at the group level, that do not account for individual variability in haemoglobin levels. \n\nThe BOLD-fMRI signal relies upon the magnetic properties of haemoglobin, which itself is closely related to haematocrit: the proportion of red blood cells in the blood. When neuronal activity within a brain region increases, the additional neuronal metabolic activity results in an increased local energy requirement, which is reflected as an increase in the regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO ) ( ;  ). The consumption of oxygen results in an early elevation of deoxygenated haemoglobin in the region. Following neuronal activity, the increased metabolic requirement results in an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) to the region to restore the local O  levels. However, the CBF to the region increases by a larger proportion than required to satisfy the increased CMRO  requirement. Consequently, the local concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin decreases, leading to an increase in the MR T2* signal. In sum, combined changes in CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV) and CMRO  are reflected in changes in local deoxygenated haemoglobin. The fMRI acquisition sequence is tuned to detect changes in the apparent transverse relaxation rate (T2*), which is sensitive to the amount of deoxygenated haemoglobin in the blood ( ;  ). Therefore, individual differences in the proportion of haemoglobin and red blood cells are evident as individual differences in BOLD SNR. Our results complement the previous studies showing that BOLD signal intensity is mediated by individual haemoglobin levels ( ;  ;  ). \n\nIn the majority of BOLD-fMRI experiments, the measurement of interest is the relative change in the BOLD signal across time (during rest, in response to a task, etc.). In other words, the change in relaxation rate   is interpreted as an indirect index of functional brain activity ( ). As the relaxation rate in BOLD-fMRI depends on the total amount of deoxygenated haemoglobin in the blood, individual differences in haemoglobin/haematocrit will specifically influence the relaxation term  . In other words, the very signal of interest in BOLD-fMRI experiments is influenced by an individual’s haemoglobin level. Notably, an individual’s haematocrit level also influences the viscosity of the blood, with higher haematocrit levels significantly slowing the rate of blood flow throughout the body ( ). Differences in CBF influences the number of spins that flow into a voxel ( ), which affects the magnetisation term   of the BOLD signal. Individual differences in haemoglobin may therefore also indirectly influence the magnetisation term of the BOLD signal. Previous studies that have aimed at minimising the effect of noise and confounds on the BOLD signal have focused on factors that vary across time, including cardiac noise, respiratory noise, motion, and low frequency drifts and fluctuations ( ). Individual differences in haemoglobin/haematocrit have not been considered as an important confound, possibly because this value does not vary for an individual during a typical scan duration. This appears to be especially so for studies of functional connectivity, which by definition examine relationships between signals that vary across time. \n\nThe relationship between BOLD-fMRI and individual differences in haematocrit has been investigated in a number of small cohort studies.   found only a modest relationship between haematocrit variability and summary measures of functional connectivity in a sample of 45 healthy younger (mean age 29yrs; s.d. 10.8) adults. Degree of centrality, fractional ALFF (amplitude of low frequency fluctuations) and voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity showed discrete clusters of significant association with haematocrit, in non-overlapping regions. Resting-state networks estimated with dual regression showed more widespread relationship with between-subject variation in haematocrit. They concluded that the impact of haematocrit variation in BOLD signal is modest and regionally-specific. In another sample of 13 healthy middle-aged (mean age 35yrs; s.d. 7) adults,   found that 22% (i.e., R =0.22) of the inter-subject variability of the BOLD response in the visual cortex to flickering checkerboard stimulus was associated with haematocrit, consistent with previous studies of haematocrit and the BOLD signal (R =0.23;  ; R =0.28,  ). When the BOLD response was normalised by the haematocrit, the BOLD signal coefficient of variation reduced by 16% leading   to conclude that normalisation of the BOLD signal by individual haematocrit levels is an important step for enhancing the detection power of BOLD-fMRI studies. \n\nThe current sample is substantially larger than the previous studies of the influence of haemoglobin on BOLD-fMRI measures ( ;  ), with a sample size of 518 subjects. Like  , our results suggest that individual differences in haemoglobin have a substantial influence on BOLD-fMRI measures of functional connectivity and functional connectivity-cognition relationships. Notably,   used a task-based (stimulus-evoked) paradigm, suggesting that the influence of haemoglobin on fMRI measures are not limited to resting-state paradigms alone. In contrast to  , we found that haemoglobin effects were widespread, spatially non-specific in men; and widespread and spatially-variable in women. Unlike the previous studies, our sample were older adults within a very narrow age range (73.8 ± 3.5yrs), with no major health problems and who passed stringent criteria for inclusion in a clinical trial ( ). \n\nAgeing is associated with a number of physiological changes that may impact the BOLD signal, including changes in oxygen extraction fraction, CMRO  and CBF ( ). Haemoglobin declines with age in men, and increases with age in women ( ;  ), such that the values for men and women become more similar in older age, but still significantly different (note however this finding is not ubiquitous, with findings of declines in haemoglobin levels for both sexes ( )). Haematocrit does not seem to change post-menopause compared to pre-menopause ( ;  ), however CMRO  has been found to change which may pose additional challenges for fMRI studies in older females ( ). Although we do not have data on the menopausal status of the women in this study, it is notable that all participants were aged over 70-years, and the mean age of menopause in Australia is 51.3-years ( ). As such, the majority of the women in this sample are likely to be post-menopausal. An important direction for future research is to examine how menopause influences BOLD physiology. \n\nHaemoglobin variations are known to coincide with cerebral blood flow changes ( ). It is possible that the correlations observed in this work are not a direct consequence of haemoglobin but a composite effect of blood flow, blood volume, and vascular reactivity, all of which may be related to haemoglobin levels. Similarly, the relationship between haemoglobin variability and frequency-based metrics (e.g., fALFF) could also be related to either BOLD signal-to-noise ratio or haemodynamic physiology. The timescale of resting-state fMRI fluctuations has been found to relate to region degree, i.e. that more strongly connected regions (‘hubs’) have slower rsfMRI BOLD fluctuations ( ). Hub locations have been found to correlate with cerebral perfusion ( ), and may reflect the variations required in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood ( ) to support hub metabolic demands ( ). Therefore, the discrete clusters of the fALFF metric related to haemoglobin, as reported by Yang et al., may indicate haemodynamic responses to hub metabolism. Differences in frequency-based fluctuations between haemoglobin groups may reflect either an influence on BOLD signal-to-noise ratio, or alternatively an anatomical overlap of timescale patterns and perfusion responses to haemoglobin variation. In summary, it remains unclear whether the relationship between haemoglobin and resting-state functional connectivity is mechanistically explained by BOLD signal intensity, blood physiology, or both. Future studies should aim to disentangle these effects. \n\nTaken together, our results provide evidence that individual differences in haemoglobin/haematocrit are an important confounding variable in functional connectivity and functional connectivity-cognition analyses. The striking difference in the effect of haemoglobin between the sexes is strong evidence for the importance of co-varying individual differences in haemoglobin when undertaking connectivity analyses. It is well-known that haemoglobin variance differs between the sexes (e.g.,  ). Our results suggest that it is possible that previous studies of sex differences in functional connectivity and connectivity-cognition relationships that did not control for haemoglobin may be confounded, at least in ageing (e.g.,  ). In addition, our results are consistent with some ( ;  ), but not other ( ) results in healthy younger adults. Given the differences in haemoglobin concentration over the lifespan ( ;  ;  ), the effect of haemoglobin on the BOLD-fMRI signal is also likely to vary with age. We therefore argue that future BOLD-fMRI studies using connectivity and connectivity-cognition between group analytical approaches should consider statistically testing for differences in the shapes of the haemoglobin distributions. Where shape differences are observed it would be prudent to re-sample the population to determine whether the results are robust to removal of the haemoglobin effects. While it is perhaps not surprising that haemoglobin-connectivity relationships differ between the sexes, our findings do not explain the directionality (positive and negative effect sizes) or why the regional spatial patterns differ between the sexes. Future studies are needed to disentangle the regional effects of haemoglobin on the BOLD signal and connectivity patterns, investigate the underlying mechanisms that may contribute to these sex differences, and further examine the influence of haemoglobin variability on connectivity and connectivity-cognition relationships. \n\nA number of approaches exist for obtaining measures of haemoglobin for inclusion in BOLD-fMRI analyses. One approach, as used in this study, involved drawing venous blood and laboratory measurement of full blood parameters. However, smaller devices that provide point-of-care metrics of haemoglobin and haematocrit are now available ( ;  ;  ). These devices require finger-prick samples of capillary blood, are quick, easy to obtain, and relatively non-invasive. Comparisons of point-of-care devices for measuring haemoglobin have been performed ( ;  ). Avcioglu et al. showed that the point-of-care measurement of haemoglobin was correlated with venous haemoglobin measures analysed with gold-standard cell analysers, with R =0.825. Alternative approaches include image-derived estimates of haematocrit using the dependence of the T1 relaxation rate in venous blood ( ), which takes around two minutes to acquire, and requires additional positioning of the subject to image the chest for complete inversion of the inflowing arterial blood ( ). Image-derived estimates of haematocrit were found to correlate strongly (R =0.91) with laboratory based measures of complete blood count ( ). In sum, the ease and cost of devices for acquiring haemoglobin or haematocrit metrics should not be a barrier for most groups acquiring BOLD-fMRI data. \n\nOne limitation of the current study is the known regional variation of haematocrit throughout the brain. Calamante et al. showed that local measures of capillary haematocrit can be obtained by combining multiple MRI sequences, namely arterial spin labelling and dynamic susceptibility contrast ( ). This approach could be used in future studies to compare the influence of haematocrit variation on regional BOLD fMRI signal characteristics, to potentially provide a neuroanatomical map of the degree of haematocrit influence on the estimation of functional connectivity metrics. Given the known variation in haematocrit values across the body ( ), brain image-derived metrics of haematocrit may be ultimately be the best method to control for haemoglobin effects in BOLD-fMRI analyses. It is also important to note that resting-state functional connectivity is sensitive to differences in pre-processing pipelines (e.g.  ) and resting-state condition (e.g., eyes open, eyes closed, fixation;  ). Future studies should confirm the influence of haemoglobin on estimates of functional connectivity under different conditions and analysis pipelines. Finally, the demographic characteristics of the current sample should be noted when interpreting these results. The observed differences between females and males may have been partially driven by the differences in haemoglobin distribution for the two groups. Particularly the non-symmetric nature of the haemoglobin values for females. In addition to controlling for between-group biases in haemoglobin, researchers may find the shape of the distributions important for accurate analyses. To comply with the inclusion criteria for the ASPREE clinical trial (during which this data was acquired), the lower limit of haemoglobin values was restricted to above 11 g/dL for females and 12 g/dL for males. This restricted range may have led to us underestimating the effect of haemoglobin variability on functional connectivity ( ). The ASPREE clinical trial is also predominantly white (91%;  ), and mean haemoglobin values are known to differ by race (e.g.,  ). As such, future work in this area should consider samples with less restricted and more representative range of haemoglobin values. \n\nIn conclusion, this study in a large sample of healthy older adults demonstrated that individual variability in haemoglobin has a substantial influence on functional connectivity and functional connectivity-cognition relationships. The effect of haemoglobin was widespread, differed substantially between the sexes, and strongly influenced functional connectivity-cognition relationships. In males the effect of haemoglobin on functional connectivity measures was widespread across brain regions whereas in females the effect varied across the brain including in subcortical regions. Acquisition of haemoglobin/haematocrit measures are readily available and future BOLD-fMRI functional connectivity and connectome studies should control for haemoglobin as a confounding variable, especially in studies aiming to compare groups of individuals, compare sexes, or examine connectivity-cognition relationships. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"c70dc91a4c46a263ddb90a375babf1d9"},

Individuals who completed at least one year of varsity collegiate football were eligible to participate in this observational cohort study (  n   = 48; aged 36–41 years; 79.2% white/Caucasian; 12.5±4.4 years of football played; all men). Individuals were excluded if they reported history/suspicion of psychotic disorder with active symptoms, contraindications to participation in study procedures (e.g., MRI safety concern), or inability to travel. Each participant provided concussion and football playing histories. Self-reported concussion history was analyzed in two different ways based on prior research: dichotomous “High” (≥3 concussions;   n   = 28) versus “Low” (<3 concussions;   n   = 20); and four ordinal categories (0–1 concussion [  n   = 19]; 2–4 concussions [  n   = 8]; 5–7 concussions [  n   = 9]; and ≥8 concussions [  n   = 12]). The Head Impact Exposure Estimate (HIEE) was calculated from football playing history captured via structured interview. Resting-state fMRI and T1-weighted MRI were acquired and preprocessed using established pipelines. Next, rsFC was calculated using the Seitzman et al., (2020) 300-ROI functional atlas. Whole-brain, within-network, and between-network rsFC were calculated using all ROIs and network-specific ROIs, respectively. Effects of CHx and HIEE on rsFC values were examined using separate multivariable linear regression models, with a-priori   α   set to 0.05. We observed no statistically significant associations between rsFC outcomes and either CHx or HIEE (  p  s ≥ .12). Neither CHx nor HIEE were associated with neural signatures that have been observed in studies of typical and pathological aging. While CHx and repetitive head impacts have been associated with changes in brain health in older former athletes, our preliminary results suggest that associations with rsFC may not be present in early midlife former football players. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSeveral factors increase the risk for clinically significant cognitive decline in aging individuals (e.g., mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and dementia) [ – ]. Among the most reported risk factors for collision-sport athletes are exposures to repetitive head impacts and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) [ – ]. Sport-related concussions (SRCs), a form of mild TBI [ ], occur commonly in American football players [ ,  ]. Studies have suggested that former football players may have earlier onset of, and/or increased risk for, cognitive decline or neurodegenerative disease diagnoses compared with the general population, purportedly due to their exposure to repetitive head impacts—SRC or otherwise—during football play [ – ,  ]. It is vital, therefore, to develop the scientific understanding of what constitutes normal versus abnormal changes in brain function as these players age. To do so requires measuring the associations between pathological changes and pertinent risk factors for neurodegenerative changes such as repetitive head impact exposure and traumatic brain injuries (e.g., SRC) sustained throughout a sporting career. \n\nOne method for examining biologic changes in brain health is resting-state functional activity as measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Changes in functional connectivity (correlated patterns of neural activity between brain regions) within large-scale functional brain networks, such as the Default Mode (DMN) [ ,  ], Dorsal Attention (DAN) [ ], and Frontoparietal Control (FPCN) [ ] networks, have been characterized among aging individuals with age-related cognitive changes as well as those with clinically significant cognitive declines (e.g., those with MCI and dementia-related disorders) [ – ]. Specifically, overall resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) may be decreased between regions within the DMN and DAN and may be stronger between the FPCN and both the DMN and DAN in cognitively normal older individuals (e.g., 60 years of age and over) compared with younger adults [ – ]. Hyperconnectivity between networks may represent an altered ability of the FPCN to serve as a “circuit breaker” [ ] for activity within the DMN and DAN, which may partially explain age-related cognitive and mood-related behavior declines [ ,  ]. The similarity between these characteristic network-based rsFC changes in those who experience age-related cognitive changes and what has been reported in studies of individuals with clinically significant cognitive declines (e.g., MCI and dementia) theoretically suggests that individuals with clinically significant cognitive declines may be experiencing exacerbated or accelerated biological aging processes [ ]. \n\nShort-term and long-term changes to rsFC have been described in active adolescent and young adult athletes following SRC, and these changes largely resemble the patterns of functional reorganization (i.e., changes to within- and between-network rsFC in large-scale networks) observed in individuals experiencing typical aging and neurodegenerative disease processes [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. There is mixed evidence as to whether rsFC changes persist beyond clinical recovery from SRC [ ,  ,  ], and studies have reported neural recruitment differences when performing a cognitive task in former football players aged between 50–75 years with three or more lifetime SRCs as compared to those with fewer, despite no observed differences in task performance [ ,  ]. Further evidence suggests that rsFC changes also occur in relation to repetitive head impacts, even without overt clinical signs or symptomsthat are consistent with a concussion diagnosis [ ]. Taken together, long-term alterations in functional connectivity may result from greater exposure to SRC and repetitive head impacts, even in relatively young individuals, and these changes may resemble those observed in individuals experiencing cognitive decline. In this light, it is also reasonable to consider functional connectivity changes as potential biomarkers for the advanced aging and the early onset of pathological changes in former football players. In this preliminary study, we measured rsFC across the whole brain, and among large-scale functional brain networks (DMN, DAN, and FPCN) in a sample of early midlife former collegiate football players to examine whether rsFC was associated with lifetime concussion history or an advanced metric of lifetime repetitive head impact exposure. We hypothesized that alterations in rsFC as the result of head impacts sustained while playing football, if present, would manifest with network connectivity patterns similar to those described above in healthy older adults, including: 1) lower whole-brain rsFC; 2) lower within-network rsFC in the DMN and DAN; and, 3) higher between-network connectivity between the FPCN and both the DMN and DAN. \n\n\n## Materials & methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants included former collegiate football players who completed an online general health survey in 2014 as part of a larger study of former collegiate athletes approximately 15-years after completion of their collegiate sport participation (the   National Collegiate Athletic Association [NCAA] 15-Year Follow-up Study  ) [ ]. The general health survey used in this study was adapted from previous studies of former football players with input from epidemiologists, athletic trainers, neuropsychologists, physicians, and former football players [ ,  ]. Former collegiate football players who completed the survey were recruited to participate in a comprehensive in-person evaluation (e.g., neuroimaging, neurocognitive testing, and patient-reported outcome measures). Each player was contacted by a research coordinator, and those who responded were screened for eligibility. Inclusion criteria for the in-person visit was participation in at least one year of collegiate football. Exclusion criteria were a history of psychotic disorder with active symptoms, any contraindications to participation in study procedures (e.g., MRI safety concern), or inability to travel. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Medical College of Wisconsin, and all participants provided written informed consent prior to participation. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nParticipants completed study visits at one of two separate institutions, and all images were acquired via 3T magnetic resonance scanner with a 32-channel head coil (Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; GE Healthcare Signa Premier at the Medical College of Wisconsin). During the course of data collection, there was a scanner software update at the Medical College of Wisconsin, resulting in three closely-related sets of acquisition parameters for each of the structural and functional MRI series ( ). T1-weighted Magnetic Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) scans were collected for each participant. \n   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition parameters across study sites.        \n\n### Data processing \n  \nStructural and functional MRI images were processed following a typically used pipeline [ ,  ]. Specifically, T1 MPRAGE images were pre-processed for each participant using Freesurfer. The brain structural images were segmented into grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and each resultant image was visually inspected by two of the study team members (SRW & JRP) for reconstruction errors. Functional data (rsfMRI) were preprocessed using FSL [ – ]. The preprocessing steps included discarding the first 10 volumes for magnetization equilibrium before processing, motion correction, and bandpass filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz). Mean signal from white matter, CSF, whole brain, and 24 motion parameters were removed using a linear regression model. In order to further reduce the motion effect, FD-DVARS “scrubbing” approach was applied [ ]. Subsequently, rsfMRI images were aligned to the corresponding T1-weighted images by using linear alignment. And the alignment between T1-weighed images and Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template was performed by using the advanced normalization tools (ANTs) [ ]. To improve the accuracy of registration, brain tissue segmentation images were employed to calculate the deformation field to the MNI template, as well as the reverse deformation field from MNI template to each individual subject. \n\nUsing the brain atlas provided by Seitzman et al. [ ], deformation back to the individual space was performed to extract the mean time-series BOLD signal for each of 300 regions of interest (ROIs). This atlas was selected as it contains multiple ROIs in subcortical grey matter structures and pre-defines large-scale resting-state networks by uniquely assigning specific ROIs to a single network (or otherwise “unassigned” designation). Pearson’s correlation coefficients (  r  ) were calculated between all pairs of ROIs for each subject. \n\n\n### Outcome measures (rsFC values) \n  \nWhole-brain rsFC was calculated as the average Pearson   r   correlation value across the BOLD signal time-series between each of the 300 individual functional ROIs. To test our hypotheses, within-network and between-network average Pearson   r   correlation values were calculated using the pre-defined DMN (65 ROIs), DAN (16 ROIs), and FPCN (36 ROIs) network nodes [ ]. Within-network average rsFC was calculated as the average between ROI Pearson   r   correlation value between all pairs of ROIs dwelling within a given network (e.g., DMN). Between-network average rsFC was calculated as the average between ROI Pearson   r   correlation value between each individual node of one specific network and each individual node of another specific network. These operationalizations resulted in seven dependent variables: 1) whole-brain average rsFC; 2) within-DMN average rsFC; 3) within-DAN average rsFC; 4) within-FPCN average rsFC; 5) DMN-DAN average rsFC; 6) DMN-FPCN average rsFC; and 7) DAN-FPCN average rsFC. \n\n\n### Concussion history & head impact exposure estimate \n  \nHistory of concussion was self-reported by each participant using a definition that has been employed in previous research with current and former athletes [ ,  ]. This operational definition described concussion as, “an injury occurring typically, but not necessarily, from a blow to the head, followed by a variety of symptoms that may include any of the following: headache, dizziness, loss of balance, blurred vision, ‘seeing stars,’ feeling in a fog or slowed down, memory problems, poor concentration, nausea, throwing up, and loss of consciousness” [ ,  ]. This method of self-reporting concussion history has shown moderate levels of consistency (weighted Cohen κ = 0.48) over repeated administrations separated by many years [ ]. After reading the operational definition of a concussion, participants then reported the total number of lifetime concussions they had sustained through sport or other mechanisms (e.g., military service, motor vehicle accidents). \n\nLifetime exposure to repetitive head impacts without diagnosed injury (e.g., head impacts that did not result in overt clinical signs or symptoms) were estimated using the adjusted Head Impact Exposure Estimate (HIEE) [ ,  ]. A 30-minute structured interview was used to gather information regarding participation in contact football games and practices across each individual year of football participation at the high school, collegiate, and professional levels [ ,  ]. For each year of play, participants detailed their primary and secondary playing positions, the average number and length (hours) of practices during each week of the pre-, regular, and post-season participation, the number of games played, and an estimate of the percentage of time playing in each game that year (0%; 25%; 50%; 75%; or 100%). These data were used to calculate a “number of contact hours” estimate for each participant. Those estimates were then adjusted to account for the number of head contacts that might be sustained for each individual by player position and level of play based on previous reports that utilized helmet-mounted accelerometers to measure head impacts [ ,  ,  ]. The resultant number (HIEE) serves as a surrogate for the estimated number of head impacts to which that individual had been exposed during football participation in high school and beyond. \n\n\n### Analyses \n  \nPrimary independent variables were lifetime self-reported concussion history and HIEE. Concussion history was operationalized in two separate ways based on common standards in the existing literature: A) dichotomous “High” (≥ 3 concussions;   n   = 28) versus “Low” (< 3 concussions;   n   = 20) history groups; and B) four ordinal categories (0 or 1 concussion [  n   = 19]; 2 to 4 concussions [  n   = 8]; 5 to 7 concussions [  n   = 9]; and 8 or more concussions [  n   = 12]). The dichotomous operationalization was selected to be similar to prior research examining the long-term effects of concussions on fMRI outcomes and cognitive function, where outcomes from participants three or more lifetime concussions were contrasted with those reporting fewer [ ,  ,  ]. Further, ordinal operationalization of concussion history in recent studies has allowed for a more granular investigation of the effects of multiple concussions on long-term brain health [ ,  ,  ], and we opted to explore (i.e., as a sensitivity analysis) whether the same phenomenon would be observed in the present study by ascribing previously used concussion history groupings from overlapping study samples [ ,  ]. The HIEE measure was included in each model as a continuous variable, regardless of the concussion history operationalization. \n\nPotential covariates were participant age, body mass index (BMI), and MRI acquisition site. Analyses were performed to test univariable associations between each potential covariate and all seven of the rsFC outcomes of interest ( ). Both BMI and MRI acquisition site were related to one or more of the outcomes individually, and were therefore included as covariates in the multivariable models. \n\nSeparate multivariable linear regression models were fit for each of the seven rsFC outcomes including our primary exposures of interest (concussion history and HIEE) as well as covariates (BMI, and MRI acquisition site) as independent variables. Altogether, there were a total of 14 models fit (seven for each operationalization of lifetime concussion history). As this was a preliminary study, we set a-priori   α   at 0.05, and we’ve interpreted results based on these values as well as measures of effect size (standardized beta values [β]). All analyses were performed with SPSS version 28.0 (Armonk, NY). Post hoc observed power for each regression was calculated in G*Power v3.1.9.7. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were recruited from a sample of former collegiate athletes who previously completed a general health survey [ ]. Initially, 123 former collegiate football players were able to be reached for in-person visit screening. Among these former players, 65 opted not to participate, met exclusion criteria (e.g., for MRI safety reasons), or did not respond to the study team. As a result, 58 former players completed in-person visits. Generally speaking, the cohort fell within the average range across indices of neurobehavioral function as described previously by Brett et al. [ ]. Three of these participants did not participate in the MRI portion of the study due to claustrophobia (n = 2) or an acquisition protocol deviation (n = 1). A total of 55 male former collegiate football players participated in the MRI study. Among these participants, 7 (12.7%) had missing (n = 1) or unusable rsfMRI data (n = 6) due to poor functional image resolution precluding measurement of BOLD signal in one or more ROI. The resulting sample size was 48 participants across both research sites ( ). \n   Participant characteristics.        \n\n### Resting state functional connectivity \n  \nAfter adjusting for BMI and MRI acquisition site, there were no statistically significant differences (  ps   ≥ 0.30) for any of the rsFC outcomes between those with “High” (three or more) versus “Low” (less than three) lifetime concussion history ( ; Figs   and  ). Similarly, when concussion history was operationalized into 4 ordinal categories, no statistically significant associations were observed (  ps   ≥ 0.12) between concussion history and any of the rsFC outcomes ( ; Figs   and  ). Finally, HIEE was not significantly associated with rsFC outcomes in any of the multivariable models (  ps   ≥ 0.14). We also computed standardized effect sizes for both concussion history and HIEE (i.e., β-values). The largest β-values were observed for HIEE in models for within-FPCN rsFC and between-network rsFC for DMN-DAN ( ). Specifically, larger HIEE was associated with lower within-FPCN and higher DMN-DAN rsFC values, regardless of the operationalization variable used for concussion history. Plots of bivariate associations between HIEE and each of the seven rsFC outcomes are in  . Observed power estimates for each model ranged from 25–91% and are presented in  . \n   Whole-brain and within-network resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in large-scale networks separated by dichotomous concussion history group.  \nWhole-brain rsFC (top-left) was calculated as the average Pearson   r   correlation (y-axes) between each of the 300 regions of interest (ROIs) and all other ROIs across the time-series.

However, there were notable effect sizes suggesting a relationship between repetitive head impacts (HIEE) and functional connectivity profiles that have been associated with the aging process (lower within-network connectivity and higher between-network connectivity). Previously reported findings related to age-related cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia in older former football players suggest that these players may be at increased risk of developing dementia-related disorders or accelerated cognitive aging [ ,  ,  ]; however evidence for causal relationships between concussion history, repetitive head impacts, and these clinical outcomes have not been established. The present study provides evidence that broad changes to neural activity in the brain in relation to accumulated head trauma from football participation may not be readily detectable (i.e., too subtle to measure) or absent in individuals approximately 15-years after their collegiate sport participation. Continued follow-up with these participants and further evidence from prospective, longitudinal monitoring of brain health in former athletes is imperative to develop an understanding of change over time and associations of long-term brain health with head trauma. \n\nIn addition to our primary categorization of concussion history into “High” (three or more) and “Low” (less than three) lifetime injury groups, we sought to explore whether a more granular, ordinal categorization scheme might identify patterns with increasing exposure to injury that could be hidden in the traditional dichotomous operationalization, as has been seen in recent research [ ,  ,  ]. Neither of the operationalizations of concussion history (dichotomous or ordinal categories) used in our study were associated with intra- or inter-network rsFC of the DMN, DAN, and FPCN networks or whole-brain rsFC. There are limitations inherent to retrospective recall of lifetime concussion history that warrant consideration when interpreting these findings, and previous work has described moderate consistency in recall over time [ ]. Despite this, self-reported concussion history has previously been associated with increased rsFC within the DMN in current collegiate athletes [ ], altered neural recruitment patterns in former football players aged between 50–75 years when completing a cognitive task [ ,  ], and with self-reported cognitive dysfunction and atypical cognitive decline [ ,  ,  ]. However, there is little research with former football players under 50 years of age related to the long-term effects of concussion history and repetitive head impacts on brain health. \n\nOur recent work with an overlapping sample of relatively young (36–41 years of age) former football players noted significant associations between greater lifetime HIEE and multiple aspects of neurobehavioral functioning–including worse subjectively reported cognitive function, general psychological distress, and executive functioning alongside worse objectively measured memory and processing speed task performances [ ]. In that study, we also observed that concussion history did not significantly alter the associations between neurobehavioral functioning and HIEE, despite these two measures of exposure to head trauma being distinct from one another [ ]. The lack of statistically significant associations between HIEE and rsFC outcomes in the present study suggests that alterations in rsFC within and between large-scale networks may not be the underlying processes (i.e., neural correlates) for the relationship between HIEE and neurobehavioral functioning, or they may require more precise measurement to detect. It is possible that the association between exposure to head trauma and rsFC may be observed by using other approaches that describe functional organization in the brain (e.g., graph theoretical measures like small world topology) [ ,  ]. These approaches warrant investigation in former football players as they may provide insight into latent constructs of brain health such as communication efficiency and resilience [ ,  ], and some graph measures have even been associated with early recognition of neurodegenerative changes [ ,  ]. \n\nThe functional connectivity data reported in this study are the first to be reported in relation to concussion and repetitive head impact history in participants of this age. Specifically, objective markers of biological brain health in former athletes below 50 years of age are relatively understudied compared to their older counterparts. It is notable that only a few (n = 7) of the participants in this study played football after their collegiate careers while also reporting 12.5 years of football play, on average. This sample is therefore mostly representative of amateur athletes who began playing football at youth levels. Research with former athletes in early midlife—especially longitudinal studies—are essential to understanding the relationships between head trauma and the aging process across the lifespan. Participants in this study with more self-reported lifetime concussions and greater HIEE did not exhibit functional connectivity differences when compared to those with fewer concussions and/or lower HIEE; however, these participants are purportedly at higher risk of developing early cognitive decline and neuropathology associated with head trauma according to previous research findings [ ,  ,  ]. Therefore, this timepoint is a key contribution to the literature in that longitudinal follow-up will allow us to investigate the interaction between head trauma and age, especially over the next decade as these participants approach 50 years of age. \n\nOne limitation of this study is the potential for error in data relying on self-report. Specifically, participants self-reported the primary exposure measures used in this study (concussion history & HIEE), and it is possible that self-reported exposure differs from the true incidence of exposure. Further, data were collected at two research sites and under three separate image acquisition protocols. To address this acquisition heterogeneity, we evaluated the association between study site and the rsFC outcomes ( ), and ultimately controlled for site in the analyses. Data from the present study may also not be representative of former collegiate football players at large, and should be considered in this light. Namely, there were only 48 participants included in our analyses, and most of them identified as White/non-Hispanic. Lack of racial and ethnic diversity, as well as other potential determinants of brain health, limit the generalizability of our findings to the population. On the whole, our sample reports limited health conditions and functional limitations [ ,  ]; however, there are thousands of former collegiate football players who may or may not be similar in their current health status. With this cross-sectional data, we cannot yet determine whether trajectories of brain health-related outcomes as players age are associated with accumulated concussion injuries or repetitive head impact exposures, and whether changes in brain health are different for former football players than non-football players. Future work should prospectively examine the time course of changes in functional connectivity in aging former football players and evaluate potential modifiers of these changes over time (i.e., expected brain health changes due to aging versus accelerated decline resulting from acquired brain trauma). \n\nAmong former collegiate football players at early midlife, we did not observe associations among concussion history or repetitive head impact exposure and neural signatures of altered large-scale functional network connectivity that have been observed in studies of age-related or clinically significant cognitive declines, as well as acute SRC. While SRC history and repetitive head impacts have been associated with changes in brain health and function in former football players and other collision and contact sport athletes, our preliminary data suggest that associations with functional network connectivity, if they exist, may not be detectable prior to older ages. Continuing to study these former players prospectively will be useful in identifying predispositions to potential accelerated aging processes, and the age at which they are most likely to present. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"21cb841ffb1322e57387975995ad93f5"},

While resting state functional connectivity may be affected by experiences preceding the resting state scan, little is known about this relationship in individuals with DD. Our study examined this question in the context of object memory. 52 individuals with DD and 45 healthy controls (HC) completed clinical interviews, and a memory encoding task followed by a forced-choice recognition test. A 5-min resting state fMRI scan was administered immediately after the forced-choice task. Resting state networks were identified using group Independent Component Analysis across all participants. A network modeling analysis conducted on 22 networks using FSLNets examined the interaction effect of diagnostic status and memory accuracy on the between-network connectivity. We found that this interaction significantly affected the relationship between the network comprised of the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampal formation and the network comprised of the inferior temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices. A stronger positive correlation between these two networks was observed in individuals with DD who showed higher memory accuracy, while a stronger negative correlation (i.e., anticorrelation) was observed in individuals with DD who showed lower memory accuracy prior to resting state. No such effect was observed for HC. The former network cross-correlated with the default mode network (DMN), and the latter cross-correlated with the dorsal attention network (DAN). Considering that the DMN and DAN typically anticorrelate, we hypothesize that our findings indicate aberrant reactivation and consolidation processes that occur after the task is completed. Such aberrant processes may lead to continuous “replay” of previously learned, but currently irrelevant, information and underlie rumination in depression. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nResting state neuroimaging techniques examine brain activation and functional connectivity in the absence of stimuli or tasks. Previous studies characterized a set of networks in which brain regions co-activate during resting state ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Resting state functional connectivity may be related to sustained information processing ( ) as well as environment monitoring and internal thought processes ( ) that can dynamically change based on the experiences preceding the resting state scan ( ;  ;  ) as well as predict task performance that follows the resting state scan ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nResting state functional connectivity is altered in a variety of psychiatric illnesses ( ;  ) including depressive disorders ( ;  ;  ). Depressive disorders (DD) (e.g., major depressive and persistent depressive disorders) are characterized by feelings of sadness, loss of interest and motivation, fatigue, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness and guilt, as well as changes in sleeping, eating, and overall cognitive and psychosocial functioning ( ). In addition, individuals with DD may experience memory dysfunction ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Previous neuroimaging studies found elevated connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) as well as between the DMN and non-DMN regions, including the dorsal attention network (DAN), insula, thalamus, and subgenual cingulate in individuals with DD relative to healthy controls (HC) ( ;  ). Clinical features of depression, such as symptom severity, illness duration, medication status and, most notably, ruminative and self-referential thought, have been linked to disruption of the cognitive control, salience, and default mode networks ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nMind wandering ( ;  ) and experiencing self-referential thoughts ( ) and spontaneous rumination ( ) might be related to intentional or unintentional reactivation of memory representations that participants encountered prior to the resting state scan and memory consolidation ( ). During memory consolidation, recently formed memories change into stable memory representations through reorganization and transitioning of hippocampal-dependent to neocortex supported memories ( ). Memory representations can be reactivated during stimulus re-study ( ), memory tests ( ), or spontaneously during rest following stimuli encoding ( ;  ). The latter is particularly relevant for the study of psychiatric disorders as it might explain such phenomena as depressive rumination, obsessive thoughts, and other aberrant forms of cognition. Given that the majority of previous studies focused on healthy individuals and administered the resting state scan following stimulus encoding and prior to a memory test ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), little is known about how the accuracy of memories acquired prior to the resting state scan is related to functional connectivity within and between resting state networks in individuals with DD, compared to HC. \n\nOur study examined whether the relationship between memory retrieval accuracy for recently encoded stimuli and resting state functional connectivity was moderated by diagnostic status. The experimental paradigm consisted of the encoding phase, during which participants encountered pictures of objects and tried to memorize them, the forced-choice recognition task, and the subsequent resting state scan in which the memorized stimuli were no longer relevant. Memory encoding, retrieval, and consolidation involve the hippocampus ( ;  ). Considering that the hippocampus is a part of the DMN ( ;  ) that has aberrant functional connectivity in individuals with DD ( ;  ;  ) and that individuals with DD have difficulty disengaging from previously learned information ( ), we hypothesized that memory accuracy in individuals with DD would be associated with aberrant DMN connectivity relative to HC. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited from the community, universities, and counseling and medical centers through referrals and advertisements. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Participants were right-handed, fluent in English, and matched on age, sex, and IQ. HC had no personal or family history of psychiatric disorders. Symptomatic participants met DSM-5 criteria for a depressive disorder (DD) such as major depressive disorder (MDD) or persistent depressive disorder (PDD). \n\nNeuroimaging data were collected from 114 participants (53 HC and 61 DD). A total of 17 participants were excluded from the analyses due to excessive motion (>2 mm translation; 7 HC and 5 DD), poor data quality due to scanner noise (1 DD) or falling asleep during the resting state scan (1 HC and 3 DD). The final sample included 45 HC and 52 DD for a total of 97 participants. Of the 52 individuals with DD, 35 were diagnosed with MDD and 17 were diagnosed with PDD. MDD and PDD differ in some characteristics, such as symptom duration and severity, yet display substantial overlap in symptomatology ( ). Of the 17 individuals with PDD, 13 had intermittent major depressive episodes, a clinical feature making the symptom profiles of MDD and PDD difficult to differentiate ( ). \n\n\n### Clinical Assessment \n  \nAll diagnoses were made by a trained clinician and confirmed by a psychiatrist according to DSM-5 criteria using the SCID-5 clinical interview ( ). We also collected information about current depression symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-25) ( ) and lifetime dimensional symptoms of depression using the MOODS-SR ( ). A total psychotropic medication load was calculated for each participant, with greater numbers and doses of medications corresponding to a greater medication load ( ;  ). Exclusion criteria included a history of head injury, metal in the body, pregnancy, claustrophobia, neurodevelopmental disorders, systemic medical illness, premorbid IQ < 85 per the National Adult Reading Test ( ), current alcohol/drug abuse, the YMRS ( ) scores >10 at scan, and meeting criteria for any psychotic-spectrum disorder.   reports group statistics for participants’ demographic and clinical characteristics. \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics. \n  \n\n### Memory Encoding and Retrieval \n  \nThe experimental paradigm is depicted on  . During encoding, participants were presented with 48 pictures of common objects and food items ( ). To ensure deep information processing, they were instructed to rate each stimulus as pleasant or unpleasant ( ;  ), and to memorize the presented stimuli. Approximately 25 min after encoding, participants performed the forced-choice object recognition task in which they were presented with pictures of an old (seen previously) and a novel (not seen previously) stimulus side-by-side and were required to select the old stimulus by pressing a corresponding button. The task consisted of 48 trials. The set of the novel stimuli was obtained from the same database as the set of the old stimuli ( ) and consisted of the items that categorically matched and visually resembled old stimuli (i.e., were from subordinate categories of old items). The pairings of novel and old stimuli were assigned randomly so that the old stimulus could be paired with a similar novel stimulus (e.g., blue chair and yellow chair), or a novel stimulus from a different category (e.g., bread and tomatoes). Each old stimulus had a closely resembling novel stimulus; therefore, participants had to have a detailed memory representation of an old stimulus to correctly identify it as old. The memory accuracy was calculated as a percent of correct responses relative to a total number of responses. While participants were scanned during both the encoding and forced-choice tasks, the neuroimaging results of these tasks will be described in separate reports. \n  \nExperimental paradigm. \n  \nThe scans administered between encoding and forced choice object recognition tasks included spin-echo field maps in the posterior-to-anterior and anterior-to-posterior phase encoding directions (30 s each), a 7-min T1w anatomical scan, a 6.5-min T2w anatomical scan, and a forced-choice recognition task for face stimuli (approximately 10 min) that were encoded before the objects in the separate task. \n\n\n### Resting State Scan \n  \nImmediately following the forced-choice recognition task, participants completed a 5-min resting state scan in which they were asked to look at the fixation star presented in the center of the screen and to stay awake. We used an eye-tracking camera system to monitor the participants’ wakefulness during the scan and made a note if a participant fell asleep or kept their eyes closed for more than 20 s. Participants also self-reported their wakefulness after the resting state scan. \n\n\n### Neuroimaging Data Acquisition \n  \nThe neuroimaging data were collected at the University of Pittsburgh/UPMC Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC) using a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner with a 64-channel head coil. The acquisition series were named according to the ReproIn naming convention ( ). The EPI data were collected in the anterior-to-posterior direction using a multi-band sequence (factor = 8, TR = 800 ms, resolution = 2 × 2 × 2 mm, FOV = 210 mm, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 52°, 72 slices, 375 volumes). High-resolution T1w images were collected using the MPRAGE sequence (TR = 2,400 ms, resolution = 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 mm, 208 slices, FOV = 256 mm, TE = 2.22 ms, flip angle = 8°). Field maps were collected in the AP and PA directions using the spin echo sequence (TR = 8,000 ms, resolution = 2 × 2 × 2 mm, FOV = 210 mm, TE = 66 ms, flip angle = 90°, 72 slices). \n\n\n### Data Analyses \n  \n#### Demographic and Clinical Data Analysis \n  \nThe demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between DD and HC groups using   t  - and chi-square tests. \n\n\n#### Memory Retrieval Analysis \n  \nWe used   t  -tests to compare recognition accuracy and response time (RT) in DD vs. HC groups. RT was calculated across trials with correct responses only. \n\n\n#### Neuroimaging Data Analysis \n  \n##### Preprocessing \n  \nThe DICOM images were converted to BIDS standard using   heudiconv version 0.5.4   ( ;   After that, the images were preprocessed using   fMRIPrep version 20.1.2   ( ;  ). First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of   fMRIPrep  . Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9, ( ;  ). BOLD runs were slice-time corrected using   3dTshift   ( ), (AFNI 20160207;  ). A B0-non-uniformity map (or fieldmap) was estimated based on two echo-planar imaging (EPI) references with opposing phase-encoding directions, with   3dQwarp   ( ) (AFNI 20160207). Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, a corrected EPI (echo-planar imaging) reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using   bbregister   (FreeSurfer) ( ;  ) which implements boundary-based registration ( ). Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom. The BOLD time-series were resampled onto the following surfaces (FreeSurfer reconstruction nomenclature):   fsaverage  . The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as preprocessed BOLD in original space, or just preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD time-series were resampled into standard space, generating a preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space. Automatic removal of motion artifacts using independent component analysis (ICA-AROMA) ( ) was performed on the preprocessed BOLD on MNI space time-series after removal of non-steady state volumes and spatial smoothing with an isotropic, Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM). Corresponding “non-aggressively” denoised runs were produced after such smoothing. Additionally, the aggressive noise-regressors were collected and placed in the corresponding confounds file. All resamplings were performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e., head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using   antsApplyTransforms   (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels ( ). Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer). \n\nWhile   fMRIPrep   automatically extracts the three global signals within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks, they are extracted prior to removal of motion artifacts using ICA-AROMA ( ). Therefore, instead of using the automatically generated values, we extracted these signals after running the ICA-AROMA (from the files with the suffix “space-MNI152NLin6Asym_desc-smoothAROMAnonaggr_bold”) and regressed the CSF and WM from preprocessed resting state data. After that, the data were band-pass temporal filtered (0.01–0.1 Hz). The processing pipeline is depicted in  . \n  \nProcessing pipeline for the resting state data analysis. \n  \n\n##### Group-Level Independent Component Analysis \n  \nThe preprocessed, registered-to-MNI-space and band-pass filtered BOLD images described above served as input files to MELODIC group-ICA ( ). We limited the number of components discovered by MELODIC to 30 to obtain large-scale networks. MELODIC uses a mixture model and the loss function to estimate the probability for a voxel to belong to the “active” or to the “background noise” classes. We implemented a default threshold of 0.5 that “places an equal loss on false positives and false negatives” ( ) to obtain thresholded group-ICA components. Prior to performing any between-group statistical analyses, these thresholded group-ICA components (3D spatial maps) were cross-correlated with Yeo’s 7-network solution maps ( ) using   fslcc  , a tool that estimates spatial similarities between ICA outputs and/or other volumetric data. The group-ICA components whose cross-correlation values exceeded 0.2 were retained for the further analyses. The remaining components were visually examined for usability. The components that followed WM tracts, or resembled physiological noise were removed from the analyses. \n\n\n##### Within- and Between-Network Analysis \n  \nAll analyses were conducted on thresholded independent component maps. Within-network connectivity was assessed with a   dual regression   which generated both subject-specific component time courses and subject-specific spatial maps as output. Dual regression automatically utilizes   randomize   [with 5000 permutations and threshold free cluster enhancement (TFCE) to correct for multiple comparisons] for non-parametric permutation testing ( ) to perform a diagnostic status-by-memory accuracy interaction analysis in this study. \n\nThe time courses generated by dual regression were fed into   FSLNets   (v0.6) to estimate between-network connectivity ( ).   FSLNets   was run using aggressive component denoising and a full correlation.   FSLNets   uses network modeling in which each variable (in our case, each ICA component) is a node in the model and each connection between any two nodes is an edge. FSLNets produces a node × node matrix of correlation coefficients that represent the strength of connections (edge strength) between any two selected nodes. The effect of the diagnostic status-by-memory accuracy interaction on edge strength was tested using   randomize   with 5000 permutations and TFCE to correct for multiple comparisons corrected-  p   < 0.05. To correct for the number of estimated contrasts (  n   = 2), we used a Bonferroni corrected   p   < 0.025. \n\n\n##### Exploratory Analysis \n  \nBecause the effects identified in the analyses described above could be related to severity of current or lifetime depression symptoms as well as the use of medications, we conducted exploratory analyses to examine the associations between severity of current (HDRS-25) and lifetime depression (MOODS-SR depression scale), as well as the age of depressive disorder onset, illness duration, current mood episode duration, and a total medication load with all significant effects identified in the resting state analyses. The exploratory analyses were conducted only in the DD group. \n\nTo further examine the heterogeneity of our patient population, we compared clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging characteristics in individuals with DD who are diagnosed with MDD vs. those diagnosed with PDD, as well as in individuals with DD with and without comorbid diagnoses. \n\nFinally, since we administered the forced-choice recognition test for faces prior to the recognition test for objects, we conducted an exploratory analysis to examine the relationship between accuracy on the facial recognition task with accuracy on the object recognition task and on the overall functional connectivity model. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Data Analysis \n  \nThe two groups did not significantly differ in age, sex, or IQ ( ). Individuals with DD, compared to HC, had significantly higher scores of current depression severity measured by HDRS-25, lifetime depression measured by MOODS-SR, and current mania symptoms measured by YMRS (  p   < 0.001). \n\n\n### Memory Retrieval Analysis \n  \nThe two groups did not significantly differ in recognition accuracy [HC = 76.3 (1.8); UD 76.9 (1.9),   t  (95) = −0.22,   p   = 0.8] and recognition RT [HC = 968 (25) msec; UD = 1010 (21) msec,   t  (95) = −1.36,   p   = 0.18]. \n\n\n### Resting State Data Analysis \n  \nOf the 30 independent components, 21 cross-correlated with Yeo’s 7-network solution ( ) with at least 0.2 ( ). During further visual examination, we identified a component that was comprised of regions in the basal ganglia. Even though this component did not correlate with any of Yeo’s networks, we retained it for the further analyses. The remaining eight components followed white matter pathways, represented the cerebellum, or followed patterns of physiological noise and, therefore, were excluded from the further analyses. \n  \nSpatial maps of 22 selected network components. Network labels are based on cross-correlation with   and values in parentheses indicate the cross-correlation coefficient. ** denotes the two components whose connectivity was related to diagnostic status-by-memory accuracy interaction. \n  \n Dual regression   did not reveal any significant effects of diagnosis-by-memory accuracy interaction on functional connectivity in any of 22 independent components. \n\n FSLNets   revealed that the strength of connectivity between the independent component (IC) 7 that cross-correlated with the DMN and the IC6 that cross-correlated with the DAN ( ) was significantly associated with the interaction between diagnostic status and memory accuracy (  p   = 0.0156). A   post hoc   analysis showed that this effect was driven by the positive correlation between the connectivity strength and memory accuracy in individuals with DD (  t   = 4.1,   p   = 0.00016). Specifically, the individuals with DD who had more accurate memory for objects had a positive relationship between the DMN and DAN connectivity. However, those with less accurate memory had a negative relationship (anticorrelation) between the DMN and DAN. In HC, the DMN-DAN relationship was not significantly associated with memory accuracy (  t   = −1.8,   p   = 0.07) and, on average, was not different from 0 [one-sample   t  -test:   t  (44) = −0.66,   p   = 0.5]. \n  \nThe diagnosis-by-memory accuracy interaction effect on the edge strength between the DMN and DAN in individuals with DD and HC. \n  \n\n### Exploratory Analyses \n  \nExploratory analyses investigated whether recognition accuracy and the connection strength between the DMN and DAN were associated with clinical variables in individuals with DD. Neither accuracy nor connection strength between the DMN and DAN were related to current or lifetime depressive symptom severity, age of DD onset, medication load, or duration of current mood episode (all   p  -values > 0.05). \n\nAnalyses investigating difference between MDD and PDD revealed that the two groups did not significantly differ in their current or lifetime depressive symptom severity, age of illness onset, or medication load (all   p  -values > 0.05;  ). Further, the two disorders did not significantly differ in recognition accuracy [MDD: 77.3 (2.2)%; PDD: 76.2 (13.8)%,   t  (50) = 0.26,   p   = 0.8] and recognition RT [MDD: 1010 (22) msec; PDD: 1019 (48) msec,   t  (50) = −0.2,   p   = 0.84]. Importantly, the linear regression analysis that predicted the DMN-DAN connectivity strength from memory accuracy yielded significant results in the MDD only sample [  F  (1,33) = 4.5,   p   = 0.04], as well as in the PDD only sample [  F  (1,15) = 13.6,   p   = 0.002], which paralleled the findings for the whole DD sample. \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of individuals diagnosed with major depressive (MDD) and persistent depressive (PDD) disorders. \n  \nIndividuals with DD with comorbid disorders had significantly higher lifetime depression severity than those without comorbid disorders based on the MOODS ( ) assessment [  t  (50) = 3.3,   p   < 0.005]. Other clinical, behavioral, and connectivity measures were not related to the presence of comorbid disorders. \n\nFinally, although the memory accuracy for faces significantly correlated with memory for objects across all participants (  r   = 0.52,   p   < 0.001), it was significantly lower than the memory accuracy for objects [  t  (96) = −9.6,   p   < 0.001]. Memory accuracy for faces was not associated with the presence of DD diagnosis. Importantly, the connectivity values were not related to the interaction between diagnostic status and memory accuracy for faces [  F  (1,93) = 1.64,   p   = 0.2]. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we investigated the interaction effect of diagnostic status (DD vs. HC) and the strength of memory representations acquired prior to the resting state scan on within- and between-network resting state connectivity. The results indicated that diagnostic status moderated the relationship between memory accuracy and the DMN-DAN connectivity strength. Specifically, the DMN and DAN anticorrelated in the individuals with DD who had lower recognition memory accuracy, but positively correlated in those with DD who had higher recognition memory accuracy. In contrast, the DMN and DAN connectivity was not associated with memory accuracy in HC. We hypothesize that the distinct relationship between memory accuracy and the DMN-DAN connectivity in individuals with DD could indicate aberrant memory reactivation and consolidation processes in depressive disorders because the resting state scan was acquired immediately after the stimulus recognition and was conducted within a timeframe of continued memory consolidation, the results were correlated with memory performance, and one of the networks included bilateral hippocampus. \n\nThe DMN increases in activation during rest ( ;  ;  ) and supports perception-independent ( ) and internally oriented cognition, such as autobiographical memory ( ), abstract representation of task details in ongoing thought processes ( ), future-oriented thought ( ), and spontaneous cognition ( ;  ). In contrast, the DAN increases in activation during cognitive task performance and is implicated in top-down control of attention ( ;  ). While the DMN typically anticorrelates with the DAN ( ;  ;  ), the degree of such anticorrelation may vary across cognitive states ( ) and environmental factors ( ). For example, one study reported that the regions in these networks co-activated during task preparation but “anti-correlated” during task performance ( ). Another study found that the DMN and working memory network (that included the regions comprising the DAN in our study) co-activated during encoding and retrieval phases of a working memory task but anticorrelated during the maintenance phase of this task ( ). Our study contributes to this line of research by showing that the relationship between the DMN and DAN is associated with psychopathology and memory accuracy in the task immediately preceding the resting state scan. \n\nResting state functional connectivity may reflect experiences acquired prior to the resting state scan ( ;  ;  ). Specifically, one study has demonstrated that the patterns of activation observed during encoding can spontaneously reactivate during a subsequent resting state scan ( ). Consistent with the memory consolidation theories ( ;  ), consolidation starts in the hippocampus and continues in the neocortex, including the PFC. Given that more accurate memory in individuals with DD, but not HC, was associated with a stronger positive relationship between the DMN (that included the bilateral hippocampus) and DAN (that included the PFC and parietal regions) during the subsequent resting state scan, we hypothesize that these findings indicate aberrant spontaneous memory reactivation and consolidation in these individuals. This pattern of results may indicate that HC disengaged from the task when the task was over, while the individuals with DD who accurately memorized the stimuli in the task were not able to do so. The latter individuals might experience spontaneous reactivation and “replay” of memories even in the absence of direct stimulation. Individuals with more accurate memories might reactivate those memories more than individuals with less accurate memories. Future studies should directly test the spontaneous memory reactivation and consolidation hypothesis because these memory processes could be a neurobiological basis for depressive rumination, which is a repetitive internal thinking pattern focusing on negative experiences and affect ( ). While we did not directly examine memory reactivation at rest or ruminative processes, the previous literature on rumination supports this idea and suggests a relationship between rumination, resting state functional connectivity, and depression. For example, in depressed individuals, this phenomenon was positively associated with functional connectivity in the anterior DMN ( ;  ), negatively associated with functional connectivity in the cortical DMN regions ( ), and was associated with more variable functional connectivity between medial prefrontal cortex and insula ( ). Future studies are needed to clarify and test the hypothesized relationship between rumination and memory reactivation and consolidation processes proposed here. \n\nThe findings from exploratory analyses in the individuals with DD revealed that the memory accuracy and DMN-DAN correlation were not significantly related to current or lifetime depressive symptom severity, the use of psychiatric medications, age of illness onset, comorbid diagnoses, or diagnosis of MDD vs. PDD in the individuals with DD. While these findings are indicative of general reorganization of connectivity between brain networks in individuals with DD, future studies need to examine other factors affecting the DMN-DAN connectivity in affected individuals. \n\nOne limitation of this study is the relatively short duration of the resting state scan. A longer scan time is preferable because it provides more reliable estimates of functional connectivity ( ). However, longer scan times also increase the likelihood of a participant falling asleep during the scan, which would affect resting state functional connectivity ( ). Sleep disturbance is one of the clinical symptoms of DD; therefore, staying awake during a longer resting state scan may be especially challenging for individuals with DD. Another limitation of this study is the lack of a baseline resting state scan performed prior to stimulus encoding or between encoding and memory retrieval. Many studies that examined the relationship between resting state functional connectivity and task performance included an additional resting state scan prior to task performance to capture baseline functional connectivity to better distinguish “trait-like” from “task-related” changes. However, determining the baseline in individuals with mood disorders might be challenging because there is no way to eliminate bias or interference from previous experiences and thus, baseline resting state data may still be affected by rumination or thoughts about previous experiences. Although we hypothesized that our findings might be related to aberrant reactivation and consolidation processes in the individuals with DD, our study was not designed to directly measure consolidation processes. Future studies should modify the existing experimental paradigm by adding a baseline resting state scan between encoding and memory retrieval as well as the second memory test after the resting state scan to test the consolidation hypothesis. Future studies should also incorporate rumination surveys and inquire about the specific thought content that participants experience during rest to discern how ruminative or other thinking patterns are related to basic memory consolidation processes in depression. In this study, we used the pictures of neutral everyday objects. However, the notion of “neutral” stimuli should be interpreted with caution in mood disorders research because affected individuals tend to misinterpret neutral stimuli as emotional ( ). Future studies should specifically examine the relationship between resting state functional connectivity and memory for positive vs. negative information immediately preceding the resting state scan. \n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that connectivity strength between the DMN and DAN during resting state was significantly associated with the interaction between participants’ diagnostic status (DD or HC) and memory accuracy in the task preceding the resting state scan. We hypothesize that these differences may relate to aberrant memory consolidation in depression, which may in turn be a basis for depressive rumination and an inability to disengage from thoughts and feelings associated with previous experiences. Understanding the relationship between resting state connectivity and previous experiences may inform the development of interventions strategies alleviating repetitive and intrusive thoughts in depression. However, future studies are needed to clarify the relationship between post-encoding and retrieval DMN-DAN resting state functional connectivity, memory consolidation, and rumination. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.

The current study was aimed to identify the alteration of morphology and resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of the hypothalamus (HTH) in interictal episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). High-resolution structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were acquired in 18 EM patients, 16 CM patients, and 21 normal controls (NC). The volume of HTH was calculated and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed over the whole HTH. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was applied to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of HTH volume. Correlation analyses with clinical variables were performed and FC maps were generated for positive HTH regions according to VBM comparison. The volume of the HTH significantly decreased in both EM and CM patients compared with NC. The cut-off volume of HTH as 1.429 ml had a good diagnostic accuracy for CM with sensitivity of 81.25% and specificity of 100%. VBM analyses identified volume reduction of posterior HTH in EM vs. NC which was negatively correlated with headache frequency. The posterior HTH presented decreased FC with the left inferior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 20) in EM. Decreased volume of anterior HTH was identified in CM vs. NC and CM vs. EM which was positively correlated with headache frequency in CM. The anterior HTH presented increased FC with the right anterior orbital gyrus (AOrG) (Brodmann area 11) in CM compared with NC and increased FC with the right medial orbital gyrus (MOrG) (Brodmann area 11) in CM compared with EM. Our study provided evidence of structural plasticity and FC changes of HTH in the pathogensis of migraine generation and chronification, supporting potential therapeutic target toward the HTH and its peptide. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMigraine is a common disabling primary headache disorder characterized by multiphase attacks of headache and a number of accompanying symptoms. Chronic migraine(CM) is defined as headache occurring on ≥15 days/month for more than 3 months with migraine features on ≥8 days/month ( ). CM affects approximately 2% of the adult population in western countries, imposing substantial burdens on individual sufferers, their families and society. Although this disorder is highly disabling and prevalent, it remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated ( ). The chronification occurs in about 2.5% or more of episodic cases annually ( ,  ). A number of potential risk factors may be associated with the transition to CM ( ). But the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to migraine chronification are still unknown. \n\nNeuroimaging has played a significant role in the current understanding of pathophysiologic processes behind migraine. The processes of migraine attacks seem to lead to increased sensitivity or hyperexcitability of different brain regions, facilitating occurrence of headache and aura ( ). The hypersensitivity of attack-generating brain regions may lead to the enhanced susceptibility to attack generation. Recent evidences suggested that the brainstem, central dopaminergic system and hypothalamus (HTH) might be crucially involved in generation of migraine attack ( ). The HTH has multiple functions in maintaining homeostasis by controlling the endocrine system, coordinating the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, integrating psyche and soma, regulating circadian rhythms and arousal, and in nociceptive processing ( ). Some clinical features of migraine point toward HTH involvement, such as yawning, tiredness and mood changes in the premonitory phase ( ), the circadian rhythmicity of attacks ( ) and the association of attacks with hormonal status and the menstrual cycle ( ). Neuroimaging studies revealed activation of HTH and altered functional coupling with the spinal trigeminal nuclei and the region of the migraine generator, i.e., the dorsal rostral pons in the premonitory and acute pain phase of migraine, suggesting that the real driver of migraine attacks might be the functional changes in hypothalamo-brainstem connectivity ( – ). In addition, a recent study found that the more anterior part of HTH seemed to play an important role in migraine chronification ( ). Therefore, the HTH might be an important biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of migraine. \n\nAs far as we know, there is no study focusing on morphometric analysis on the HTH in chronic migraine. Structural neuroimaging may provide an easier way than functional neuroimaging in clinical practice and add complementary information in speculating mechanisms of the HTH in the pathogenesis of migraine. We had the following hypothesis: (1) the volume of HTH may change in migraineurs; (2) the volume of HTH sub-regions may change in different patterns for CM and interictal episodic migraine (EM); (3) there might be altered functional connectivity(FC) of the positive sub-regions in HTH. To address these hypotheses, we prospectively conducted a study investigating the morphological changes and FC of the HTH in patients with CM, EM and healthy controls (HC) via high-resolution structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by calculating the volume of HTH, performing voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis over the whole HTH, and generating FC maps. By doing this, we aimed to investigate the role and possible mechanisms of HTH in migraine and the chronification. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nEighteen EMs, 16 CMs and 21 normal controls (NCs) were recruited from the International Headache Center, Department of Neurology, Chinese PLA General Hospital. All the patients should fulfill the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition (ICHD-III) criteria of episodic or chronic migraine without aura ( ), and the inclusion criteria was as follows: (1)The diagnosis of migraine refers to 1.1 Migraine without aura; (2) EM is defined as migraine attack days being <15 days per month, and diagnosis of CM refers to 1.3 CM in ICHD-III; (3) no migraine preventive medication used in the past 3 months; (4) absence of any chronic disorders, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular disorders, neoplastic diseases, other subtypes of headache, chronic pain other than headache, severe anxiety or depression preceding the onset of headache, psychiatric diseases, etc.; (5) absence of alcohol, nicotine, or other substance abuse. The inclusion criteria of NC were similar to those of patients, except for the first three items. NC should never have any primary headache disorders or other types of headache in the past year. The exclusion criteria were the following: cranium trauma, illness interfering with central nervous system function, psychotic disorder, and regular use of a psychoactive or hormone medication. \n\nAll the patients were given with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for the pain intensity evaluation, the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) for the anxiety evaluation, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) for the depression evaluation and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for the cognitive function evaluation. All the subjects were right-handed and underwent conventional MRI examination to exclude the subjects with cerebral infarction, malacia, or occupying lesions. Alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, and other substances were avoided for at least 12 h before MRI examination. All the patients underwent MRI scanning at least 3 days after last migraine attack. CM patients may have headache but not with migraine feature during MRI scanning. The study protocols were approved by the Ethical Committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consents were obtained from all participants before the study. \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nAll the MRI data were acquired on a GE 3.0T MR system (DISCOVERY MR750, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) and a conventional eight-channel quadrature head coil was used. All subjects were instructed to lie in a supine position, and formed padding was used to limit head movement. High resolution structural images were acquired with a three-dimensional T1-weighted fast spoiled gradient recalled echo (3D T1-FSPGR) sequence [TR (repetition time) = 6.3 ms, TE (echo time) = 2.8 ms, flip angle = 15°, FOV (field of view) = 25.6 × 25.6 cm, Matrix = 256 × 256, NEX (number of acquisition) = 1]. Resting-state functional MR images were obtained using a gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, slice thickness = 3 mm, slice gap = 1 mm, FOV = 24 × 24 cm, Matrix = 64 × 64). One hundred and eighty axial EPI functional volumes were obtained over 6 min. Oblique axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), T1 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T1-FLAIR) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) were also acquired. All imaging protocols were identical for all subjects. No obvious structural damage and T2-visible lesion were observed based on the conventional MR images. \n\n\n### MR Image Processing \n  \nAll MR structural image data were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM 12) ( ) running under MATLAB 7.6 (The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). The individual HTH segment included following steps: (1) Resliced a high-resolution probabilistic   in vivo   atlas of human HTH ( ) into MNI space; (2) Individual structural images were performed with segment using DARTEL methods ( ,  ), and generate gray matter, white matter and deformation field; (3) Individual HTH segment by applying the inverse deformation field to the HTH template; (4) Calculated the individual HTH volume by summing over all voxels in the individual HTH ( ). \n  \nIndividual HTH segment. Top line: high resolution probabilistic   in vivo   HTH template was resliced into MNI space; Bottom line: Individual T1 images were segmented, and generated deformation field, which would be used to generate individual HTH using pull-back strategy. Red and purple represent 3D visualization of HTH template and individual HTH. \n  \nVoxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of HTH included following steps: (1) Gray matter images (generated by DARTEL segment) were smoothed with an isotropic 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian-kernel; (2) A general linear model was used to compare HTH volume changes on voxel level with age, sex and TIV as covariance; (3) Small volume correction (  P   < 0.05, no cluster size threshold) was applied in a region by the standard HTH template; (4) False discovery rate (FDR) was assessed to perform the multiple comparison corrections (  P   < 0.05) \n\nThe volume extraction of the altered volume of the HTH region in VBM processing ( ): (1) All the positive clusters of VBM were saved as posterior HTH template for EM vs. NC comparison and anterior HTH template for CM vs. NC comparison, respectively; (2) Individual positive HTH segment by applying the inverse deformation field to the anterior and posterior HTH template to generate the individual anterior and posterior HTH; (3) Calculated the individual positive HTH volume by summing over all voxels in the individual positive HTH region. \n  \nThe individual anterior and posterior HTH segment. CM, chronic migraine; EM, episodic migraine; HTH, hypothalamus; NC, normal control; VBM, voxel-based morphometry. \n  \nThe functional connectivity (FC) analysis was processed using DPABI software (V4.3_170105) ( ) as following: (1) First 10 volumes of the resting-state functional images were removed; (2) Slice timing correction; (3) Head motion correction; (4) Structural images were coregistered to the functional images; (5) The nuisance regressors were removed according to Yan's methods ( ), which included motion parameters and their derivatives, global, white matter, CSF time series; (6) The linear trend removal and temporal band-pass filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz); (7) Spatial normalization using by DARTEL; (8)The clusters were classified as the seeds based on VBM comparisons among EM, CM and NC; (9) FC was calculated and the individual FC maps were normalized to Z-maps using Fisher's Z transformation;(10) Smoothing with a 6 mm Gaussian kernel, and two-sample   t  -test was performed with age and sex as covariables to identify the brain regions with significant difference in FC with the positive HTH regions with altered volume among EM, CM, and NC. Significance was set as   P   < 0.001 without correction. The minimal number of continuous voxels was set based on the expected voxels per cluster. The statistical analysis was performed by SPM12 software. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nThe statistical analysis was performed by using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 23) and MedCalc (version 11.4.2.0). The normal distribution data presented by mean±standard deviation, and the non-normal distribution data presented by median (minimum, maximum). Age was performed with one-way analysis of variance, sex with Chi-square test, VAS with independent   t  -sample test, MIDAS, disease duration (DD) and headache frequency with Mann-Whitney U test because of non-normal distribution. HAMA, HAMD, and MoCA score were performed with one-way analysis with LSD method for variance homogeneity and Dennett's T3 method for variance non-homogeneity. HTH volume was performed with one-way analysis of covariance with age, sex, and total intracranial volume (TIV) as covariance. Pearson's correlation analysis was applied with the normal distribution data, and Spearman's method was applied with the non-normal distribution data. Significant difference was set at a   P   < 0.05. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was applied to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of HTH volume and area under the curve (AUC) was recognized reasonable diagnostic valuable with AUC set at >0.7. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Comparison of Clinical Variables and HTH Volume Among NC, EM, and CM \n  \n presented that there was significant difference for age between EM and CM, sex between NC and EM (  P   = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively).

In this study, both EM and CM patients had lower HTH volume than NC. The cut-off volume of HTH as 1.429 ml showed a good level for the diagnosis of CM by ROC analysis. VBM analysis further identified that the decreased HTH volume located in posterior HTH for EM and in anterior HTH for CM compared with NC. The altered volume in these HTH regions had association with headache frequency and presented altered FC with different brain regions, respectively. As a whole, our study added evidence that HTH may play an important role in migraine and migraine chronification. \n\nHTH serves as a crucial center for the integration and coordination of various brain functions. Despite its relatively small size, the HTH expresses a large number of different neurotransmitters and peptide hormones and has wide connection to other brain regions ( ). Anatomically HTH can be divided into the lateral and medial level and four rostrocaudal levels: preoptic, anterior, tuberal, and posteror HTH ( ). Each region has distinct patches of nuclei and associated functions ( ). The preoptic area contains medial preoptic nucleus, uncinate nucleus, intermediate nucleus, and is known to control thermoregulation, reproduction, and electrolyte balance. The anterior HTH, including the supraoptic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus and anterior periventricular nucleus, regulates feeding, circadian rhythms, autonomic system, and other homeostatic processes. The tuberal HTH includes the arcuate nucleus, median eminence, and ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamus, and plays a role in energy balance, stress response, menstrual cycle, pain modulation and aggression. The posterior HTH, which includes the mammillary bodies and the dorsally located posterior hypothalamic nucleus, is involved in processing emotion, as well as spatial and episodic memory ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nThe role of HTH in cluster headache (CH) and other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) has been identified in many studies. Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional MRI studies demonstrated that the posterior HTH is activated during attacks of CH and some other TACs ( ,  ). Resting-state functional MRI studies also found altered FC of HTH with the salience network (SN) ( ) and a number of diencephalic-mesencephalic dopaminergic structures ( ) in CH. VBM MRI has found significant structural differences in the HTH posterior gray matter compared with controls ( ). Considering the important role of posterior HTH in CH, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of posterior HTH has been developed as an optional treatment which produced a decrease in attack frequency of more than 50% in 60% of chronic CH patients ( ). In recent years, the important role of HTH in migraine has also been revealed by functional neuroimaging studies ( – ,  ) implicating a potential therapeutic target for migraine. HTH has shown co-activation and altered FC with brainstem immediately before or during migraine attack ( – ) suggesting that hypothalamo–brainstem connectivity may be the real driver of migraine attacks. Even in interictal phase of migraine, HTH showed increased FC with a number of brain regions involved in regulation of autonomic functions, including the locus coeruleus, caudate, parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum, and the temporal pole, which may explain some of the hypothalamic-mediated autonomic symptoms that accompany or precede migraine attacks ( ). The altered HTH volume in our study further supported the role of HTH in the pathogenesis of migraine. Different from the increased HTH volume of CH ( ,  ), patients of both EM and CM in our study had decreased HTH volume, indicating different neuromechanism of migraine from CH. Unlike the previous study analyzing FC of the whole HTH in interictal migraine ( ), our study focused on the FC of the positive HTH regions detected in VBM comparisons and thus may further reveal the mechanism of HTH sub-regions in migraine and its chronification. \n\nThe sub-regions of HTH related to CH and migraine mainly located in posterior HTH ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and anterior HTH ( ,  ) as reported in the neuroimaging studies. The posterior HTH may be involved in headache generation ( ,  ) and acute pain ( ). In our study, the reduced volume of posterior HTH was only present in interictal EM and the volume reduction was negatively correlated with headache frequency in EM, suggesting that the decreased volume of posterior HTH may reflect some deficit in pain processing or modulating systems and lead patients vulnerable to migraine generation while repetitive migraine attacks may vise verse contribute to the volume regain of posterior HTH. The volume regain was considered to be related to neuronal or glial cell genesis, cell size increase, changes in cortical synaptic connectivity, neurogenic inflammation and changes in blood flow or interstitial fluids due to repetitive migraine attacks ( ,  ). But the underlying mechanism of the structural alteration is yet to be elucidated. Further functional MRI in our study found decreased FC of the posterior HTH with the left inferior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 20). The inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) is associated with visual object recognition and has been suggested as the final location of the ventral cortical visual system, which acts as a link between auditory and visual processing, perception, and memory ( ). The ITG has been reported to present lower gray matter density ( ), and hyperperfusion ( ) in interictal migraine. The decreased FC of posterior HTH with the left ITG in EM may suggest the connection of migraine driver with silent cortical spreading depression ( ) and may reflect migrainuers' hypersensitivity to visual and auditory stimuli. \n\nOne functional MRI study found a significantly stronger activation of the anterior right hypothalamus in CM compared to HC indicating that the more anterior part seemed to play an important role in migraine chronification ( ). In consistency with this study, we identified that the volume of anterior HTH decreased in CM compared with both EM and NC in VBM analysis and the volume reduction was positively correlated with headache frequency in CM, which further supported the participation of anterior HTH in migraine chronification. The anterior HTH presented increased FC with the right anterior orbital gyrus (AOrG) (Brodmann area 11) and the right medial orbital gyrus (MOrG) (Brodmann area 11) compared with NC and EM, respectively. The OrG is responsible for very complex emotional and cognitive functions. Brodmann area 11 also receives olfactory and auditory information ( ). Previous studies have provided neuropsychological evidence of OrG dysfunction in CM with medication overuse such as depression, dependence, impaired task performance and decision making ( – ). Neuroimaging studies identified hypometabolism ( ) and volume reduction of the OrG in CM with medication overuse ( ) and without medication overuse ( ). The OrG has been proven in animal experiment to exert a direct influence on the anterior HTH ( ). The OrG–HTH interaction has also been identified in resting-state fMRI data of human subjects ( ). Therefore, the increased FC of anterior HTH and OrG in CM in our study may indicate the role of anterior HTH in the relationship of emotional and execution dysfunction with overweight, autonomic disorder and sleep problem in CM ( ). However, the altered volume and FC of anterior HTH is the cause or outcome of migraine chronification is still a debate. \n\nThe HTH has an important role in pain perception. There is evidence of anatomical connections between the HTH and the trigeminal nucleus ( ). More evidences confirmed the important role of the posterior HTH in regulating trigeminovascular processing through the analgesic effect by injection of opioids, or resection, or neurostimulation of this region ( ). The HTH hosts many key neuropeptide systems, such as orexins, oxytocin, neuropeptide Y, and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating protein(PACAP), etc., which have been postulated to play a role in migraine pathophysiology. Potential therapeutic compounds targeting these systems may have efficacy in treating migraine ( ). Oxytocin is synthesized in magnocellular neurosecretory cells in both the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the anterior HTH ( ). Oxytocin receptors located in numerous brain and spinal cord regions including dorsal root and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-expressing trigeminal ganglia neurons, suggesting a role in pain modulation ( ,  ). Intranasal oxytocin was associated with strong analgesic effect for CM possibly by upregulating oxytocin receptors on trigeminal neurons following inflammatory or noxious stimulation and reducing CGRP release ( ). The decreased volume of anterior HTH in CM detected in our study may in part reflect structural plasticity of Oxytocin neurons and the deficit in OrG–HTH-brainstem pain modulatory system may be one of the pathogensis of CM. Both anterior and posterior HTH also contain PACAP neurons. Descending projections of PACAP neurons from the posterior, paraventricular, lateral, dorsomedial and pre-optic hypothalamic nuclei to the trigeminocervical neurons and superior salivatory nucleus, are thought to be involved in mediating cranial autonomic symptoms and dural neuro-inflammatory mechanisms of primary headache ( ). Besides, PACAP was involved in control of circadian rhythms, learning, memory, and stress ( ), which may also be related to migraine pathophysiology. PACAP can induce migraine-like headache ( ,  ) and the PACAP system is the subject of significant interest as a potential therapeutic target for migraine ( ). Researches on these HTH neuropeptide systems, the HTH structural plasticity and functional alteration may extend our knowledge to migraine pathogenesis and treatment. \n\nOur study has some limitations. Firstly, the age and sex were not compatible among the groups. To diminish the influence on volume and FC analysis, we used age, sex and TIV as covariance. Secondarily, we did not compare the volume difference between patients suffering headache and not suffering headache because only 2 of the 16 CM patients were headache free when taking MRI scanning. Therefore, it is unknown how headache influence the HTH volume in CM. Thirdly, we did not measure the migraine-associated neuropeptide released from the HTH in the blood. Further studies may measure these peptides to better elucidate the alteration of the HTH in neuroimaging findings. \n\nIn conclusion, we provided neuroimaging evidence that the structural plasticity and FC alteration of HTH happened in interictal EM and CM. HTH volume <1.429 ml may have a good diagnostic value for CM and would be considered as a biomarker of CM. Migraine generation may be triggered by the abnormal structure and function of the posterior HTH while the anterior HTH seemed to be associated with migraine chronification. The role of the HTH in migraine pathogenesis may be due to its connection with multiple pain processing areas and the key neuropeptide systems related to migraine. Therapeutic targets toward these peptides or abnormal HTH regions as detected in this study may be tested in future studies. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Ethics Committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital with written informed consent from all subjects.

However, its generalizability to intrinsic spinal networks remains incompletely understood. Previously, Barry et al., 2014 used fMRI to reveal bilateral resting state functional connectivity within sensory-dominant and, separately, motor-dominant regions of the spinal cord. Here, we record spike trains from large populations of spinal interneurons in vivo in rats and demonstrate that spontaneous functional connectivity also links sensory- and motor-dominant regions during unconsciousness. The spatiotemporal patterns of connectivity could not be explained by latent afferent activity or by populations of interconnected neurons spiking randomly. We also document connection latencies compatible with mono- and disynaptic interactions and putative excitatory and inhibitory connections. The observed activity is consistent with the hypothesis that salient, experience-dependent patterns of neural transmission introduced during behavior or by injury/disease are reactivated during unconsciousness. Such a spinal replay mechanism could shape circuit-level connectivity and ultimately behavior. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSynchronous neural activity across functionally and spatially distinct brain structures, that is, functional connectivity, is a hallmark of sensorimotor integration, cognition, and behavior during periods of attentive wakefulness. Recent elucidation of brain networks intrinsically active during unconsciousness and inattentive wakefulness has led to a substantially more nuanced view of brain function ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Unconscious network activity spans multiple spatiotemporal scales and has known functions ranging from circuit-level synaptic stabilization ( ;  ;  ) to maintenance of ongoing physiological processes ( ). Although the finding of spontaneous, non-random network activity during unconsciousness appears to be robust across different functional regions of the brain, it has yet to be unequivocally confirmed whether this phenomenon is a conserved feature of complex neural systems that generalizes to the spinal cord. \n\nPatterns of resting state functional connectivity in the spinal cord have only been preliminarily characterized ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The most reliable findings to date have been correlations between spontaneous BOLD signals in the left and right dorsal horns, and, separately, the left and right ventral horns (VHs) ( ;  ;  ;  ). Spontaneous connectivity between the dorsal horn and VH, between the intermediate gray (IG) and the VH, and within the VH itself has yet to be reliably delineated. \n\nOther gaps also exist. For example, it is unknown whether network topologies evinced by spinal BOLD signals mirror those drawn from spike trains of individual neurons. Indeed, BOLD signals are only indirectly linked to spiking activity ( ;  ;  ), which is compounded by the relatively coarse spatiotemporal resolution of fMRI in the spinal cord. It is also not readily apparent whether structured activity at the single-unit level actually persists in spinal networks during unconsciousness in the absence of evoked neural transmission. The most relevant evidence, which suggests that aggregate multi-unit and local field potential activity in the dorsal horn is broadly correlated with dorsal horn BOLD fluctuations, was made during mechanical probing of the dermatome ( ). \n\nThe potential function(s) of resting state intraspinal connectivity are likewise unknown. An intriguing possibility is that it plays a role in adaptive or maladaptive neural plasticity through a form of reactivation and synaptic stabilization during unconsciousness. This hypothesis is drawn from the function of supraspinal network activity during sleep ( ;  ;  ) and is supported by the finding of altered patterns of BOLD-based intraspinal functional connectivity in conditions associated with maladaptive neural plasticity in spinal networks ( ;  ). To have a direct role in shaping neural plasticity, however, a necessary substrate would be the tandem presence of synchronous discharge amongst populations of individual units spanning multiple spatial and functional regions. \n\nGiven the critical role played by the spinal cord in sensorimotor integration (broadly) and reflexes (specifically), we reasoned that spontaneous functional connectivity between neurons in sensory-dominant and motor-dominant regions of the gray matter would be a precondition for functional network activity during unconsciousness, regardless of its function. And for the reasons noted above, such a finding would have important implications for both the physiological and pathophysiological states. Several fundamental questions remain unresolved, however. Here, we address three. First, is neuron-level functional connectivity evident in regions of the spinal gray matter not traditionally associated with primary afferent inflow? Second, is spontaneous functional connectivity evident between sensory and motor regions of the gray matter? And third, does the proportion of spontaneously active neurons exhibiting correlated discharge, as well as their topology, depart from that which would be expected amongst an interconnected population of statistically similar neurons firing uncooperatively (i.e., randomly)? \n\nWe addressed these questions in vivo in rats, recording large populations of single units throughout the dorsoventral extent of the lumbar enlargement. We find that robust spontaneous neural activity is prevalent throughout the gray matter during unconsciousness and that neurons in sensory and motor regions exhibit significant, non-random correlations in their spatiotemporal discharge patterns. We also find a substantial portion of connection latencies consistent with mono- and disynaptic interactions, offering clues to a possible mechanism by which intrinsic network activity could directly shape synaptic plasticity. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nAll experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committees at Florida International University and Washington University in St. Louis. \n\n### Surgical procedures, electrode implantation \n  \nExperiments were performed in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (  N   = 24; weight), divided across two cohorts. Fifteen animals received urethane anesthesia (1.2 g/kg i.p.). The remaining nine animals received inhaled isoflurane anesthesia (2–4% in O ). Heart rate, respiration rate, body temperature, and SpO  were monitored continuously during the experiments (Kent Scientific, Inc), and temperature was regulated via controlled heating pads. \n\nIn a terminal, aseptic procedure, a skin incision was made over the dorsal surface of the T1–S1 vertebrae and the exposed subcutaneous tissue and musculature were retracted. The T13–L3 vertebrae were cleaned of musculotendonous attachments using a microcurette and the vertebral laminae were removed to expose spinal segments L4–6. The rat and surgical field were then transferred to an anti-vibration air table (Kinetic Systems, Inc) enclosed in a dedicated Faraday cage. \n\nClamps were secured to the vertebrae rostral and caudal to the laminectomy site, and the rat’s abdomen was elevated such that respiration cycles did not result in upward or downward movement of the chest cavity or spinal cord. Under a surgical microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc), the exposed spinal meninges were incised rostrocaudally and reflected. The spinal cord was then covered in homeothermic physiological ringer solution. \n\nA custom four-axis motorized micromanipulator with submicron resolution (Siskiyou Corp.) was then coarsely centered over the laminectomy site. A silicon microelectrode array (NeuroNexus, Inc) custom electrodeposited with activated platinum-iridium electrode contacts (Platinum Group Coatings, Inc) was mated via Omnetics nano connectors to a Ripple Nano2+ Stim headstage (Ripple Neuro, Inc). The microelectrode array contained two shanks, each with 16 individual electrode contacts spaced uniformly at 100 μm intervals ( ). Electrode impedance ranged from ~1 to –4 kΩ per contact. The headstage was then securely fastened to the micromanipulator for implantation. During implantation, the data acquisition system was configured for online visualization of multi-unit and spiking activity from all 32 electrodes. Neural waveforms for specific electrode channels were also patched into an audio monitor (A-M Systems, Inc) for additional real-time feedback. \n   Experimental setup and design.  \n(  a  ) Dual-shank microelectrode arrays with 32 independent recording contacts were implanted into the spinal cord at the L5 dorsal root entry zone. Electrodes spanned the superficial dorsal horn (sDH), deep dorsal horn (dDH), intermediate gray matter (IG), and the ventral horn (VH). Multi-unit neural activity was recorded from each electrode (e.g., upper gray trace) and discriminated offline into spike trains of individual units (red single-unit waveforms and spike train raster plots depict four units found on a single channel). Temporal synchrony between spontaneously co-active units was then analyzed via correlation-based approaches (cross-correlation ‘xcorr’ histograms below rasters, vertical red lines illustrate the 0 ms lag point). (  b  ) Illustration of procedure for generating the synthetic dataset. Each spike, from every identified neuron in every trial, was randomly jittered by [−5:5] ms or, separately, [−50:50] ms. The jittered data were then reconstructed, forming synthetic trials containing neurons with firing properties that were statistically similar to the observed data. This process was then repeated over 1000× to generate a large synthetic dataset from which to sample. Spatiotemporal correlation analyses then proceeded on this synthetic dataset to benchmark the empirically observed data. \n  \nThe electrode implantation site targeted the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve, with particular emphasis on sensitivity to receptive fields on the glabrous skin of the plantar surface of the ipsilateral hindpaw toes. The implantation site corresponded closely to the L5 spinal nerve dorsal root entry zone in all animals. Initial implantation site verification was performed by mechanically probing the L5 dermatome, specifically on the plantar aspect of the ipsilateral hindpaw, with the bottom-most electrodes of the microelectrode array being in contact with the dorsal roots at their entry zone. If clearly correlated multi-unit neural activity was evident, the probe was slowly advanced ventrally in 25 μm increments until the deepest row of electrodes was ~200 μm deep to the dorsal surface of the spinal cord. The L5 dermatome was again probed to verify alignment between neural activity at the implantation site and the dermatome. If correlated multi-unit activity was again observed, the electrode continued to be advanced ventrally in 25 μm increments until the ventral-most row of electrode contacts was 1600–1800 μm deep to the dorsal surface (and correspondingly, the dorsal-most row of electrode contacts, i.e., the most superficial, was 100–200 μm deep to the dorsal surface of the spinal cord). \n\nIn cases where multi-unit dorsal root activity was   not   clearly correlated with the desired hindpaw receptive field, but rather was correlated with a different receptive field (e.g., on the hairy skin of the leg), the electrode was repositioned prior to implantation. In cases where   no   discernible correlation could be observed between a receptive field and dorsal root activity, yet the electrode was positioned over the L5 dorsal root entry zone, the electrode was advanced in 25 μm increments to a depth of 200 μm ventrally into the spinal cord and the receptive field mapping procedures was performed again. If appropriate activity was observed, the electrode was tracked fully; if not, it was removed and a new track was made. \n\nIn all cases, electrodes were advanced slowly to the target depth to avoid compression of the spinal cord and minimize intraspinal trauma from shear. After every ~100–200 μm of penetration, electrode advancement was paused momentarily. Penetration was resumed when neural activity (evinced by multi-unit and spiking data from implanted channels) stabilized. \n\nIn two animals, the sciatic nerve of the ipsilateral hindlimb was exposed proximal to its bifurcation into the tibial and peroneal nerves and a silver hook electrode (A-M Systems, Inc) placed around the nerve to record electroneurographic (ENG) activity. Upon completion of surgical procedures and data collection, all animals were humanely euthanized in accordance with AVMA guidelines via overdose of sodium pentobarbital (i.p. injection of Fatal Plus solution). \n\n\n### Experimental procedure \n  \nWe established resting motor threshold for each animal prior to recording spontaneous neural transmission. We delivered single pulses of charge-balanced current (cathode leading, 200 μs/phase, 0 s inter-phase interval) to electrodes located in the VH, with current intensity increasing in increments of 5 μA until a muscle twitch was detected in the L5 myotome (toe twitch on ipsilateral hindpaw). Current intensity was then reduced in 1 μA steps until the twitch was undetectable. Subsequently, we increased current intensity again in 1 μA increments until a twitch was recovered. The lowest current at which a twitch was detected, across all electrodes, was considered to be resting motor threshold. \n\nWe recorded 10–20 trials of spontaneous intraspinal neural transmission per animal. Each trial lasted for ~2–5 min. Raw, broadband neural activity was sampled continuously from the microelectrode array at 30 kHz. Electrical line noise and harmonics were removed via hardware filters prior to digitization. During data acquisition epochs, data from all 32 electrode channels was streamed in real time to a 60′ flat screen monitor. These data were high-pass filtered at 750 Hz to reveal multi-unit neural activity (e.g.,  ). On channels in which single-unit activity was readily observable, dual-window time-amplitude discriminators were used to discriminate and visualize real-time single-unit spiking activity. Prior to each trial, the dermatome was mechanically probed to ensure ongoing consistency between electrode placement and receptive field location and to assess qualitatively the overall degree of neural excitability. The latter assessment in particular was used in conjunction with vital and other physiological signs to control depth of anesthesia and ensure that neural excitability did not become progressively depressed during the data acquisition session. \n\nFor sciatic nerve recordings, we first collected trials of spontaneous, baseline ENG (~1–5 min per trial). We then induced sensory transmission in the nerve by mechanically stimulating the L4, L5, and L6 dermatomes. Specifically, we recorded ENG during periods of innocuous cutaneous stimulation of the glabrous and hairy skin and during periods of proprioceptive stimulation. Proprioceptive stimuli included ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion, abduction and adduction of the toes, and holding joints in a flexed or extended position for a prolonged period of time. Sensory stimuli lasted ~30 s each, with 30 s to 1 min elapsing between stimuli. Subsequently, we blocked transmission in the nerve via epineurial injection of lidocaine (20 μL, 2%) ( ;  ;  ) and repeated the sensory transmission experiments described above. This pharmacological nerve block is a form of deafferentation that avoids the confound of ectopic discharge sometimes observed with mechanical sectioning of the nerve. ENG was sampled at 30 kHz (Ripple Neuro, Inc), and filtered offline to remove electrical noise (60, 120, and 180 Hz). We applied a broadband filter to the data (40 Hz to 15 kHz) to enable detection of compound action potentials/multi-unit activity as well as any potential single-unit action potentials. \n\n\n### Discrimination of units, correlation and functional connectivity analyses \n  \nSingle-unit neural activity was discriminated offline using the unsupervised, wavelet-based clustering approach ‘wave_clus’ (parameters: bandpass filter: 1 Hz to 15 kHz; minimum detection threshold: 4 standard deviations [SD] from mean; maximum detection threshold: 25 SD; detection thresholds on both positive and negative deviations; filter order for detection: 4; filter order for sorting: 2) ( ). The veracity of discriminated units was verified manually. Spurious and/or duplicative units were identified and eliminated, with particular focus on units discriminated on the same or adjacent electrodes. Exclusion criteria were both quantitative (e.g., predominance of ISI < 2 ms) and qualitative (e.g., non-physiological shape, inappropriate action potential duration). Functional connectivity analyses then proceeded as follows on a per-trial basis, where pairs of units found to exhibit statistically significant temporal synchrony were deemed ‘functionally connected.’ \n\nFirst, we computed the cross-correlation of all unique pairs of admissible units from the 32-channel microelectrode array, effectively analogous to computing peri-spike time histograms for each pair ( ). These computations were performed without regard to the anatomical/spatial location of the units and without defining each units of a pair as either pre- or post-synaptic. Connection latency was taken to be the time to peak correlation strength. Connection polarity (excitatory or inhibitory) was inferred using the normalized cross-correlation approach ( ;  ). \n\nWe then quantified the strength of correlation by adapting an approach originally developed to be compatible with spike trains containing a relatively small numbers of spikes ( ;  ). This calculation led to a correlation coefficient analogous to the Pearson correlation coefficient common in linear regression. If the number of spikes per train is sufficiently low (  N   ≤ ~50), it is possible to use this approach to compute p-values via Fisher’s exact test ( ). However, our surprisingly vigorous spontaneous neural transmission (see Results), coupled with the length of each trial, rendered Fisher’s exact test largely intractable. As the number of spikes in a train increases, however, the distribution of spike times approximates the chi-square distribution and enables that statistic and associated degrees of freedom be used for computation of p-values associated with each correlation coefficient. \n\nGiven the large number of neurons discriminated per trial (~50–70 on average), and thus the large number of unit-pair combinations in which we computed correlation strength, careful attention was paid to multiple comparison corrections to minimize the prevalence of falsely concluding that a pair of units was significantly correlated. Controlling the family-wise error rate by applying Bonferroni correction to each test, as is often used for post-hoc multiple comparisons corrections in statistical inference, is inappropriate for datasets such as ours with trials containing extremely large numbers of non-independent comparisons ( ). Therefore, we instead used the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate of our data on a per-trial basis. This approach ensures that the proportion of false-positive findings amongst all findings deemed to be significant is no more than specified level (in our case, 5%). The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure is applied at the trial level, and the specific p-value deemed to indicate statistical significance is a function of the data from which the statistics are being inferred. Thus, the significant p-value may be relatively more or less across different trials. Controlling the false discovery rate is a validated method for multiple comparisons corrections with datasets containing large numbers of comparisons, and it is particularly effective for situations in which certain elements being compared in a trial are likely to be more or less correlated than others due to factors such as anatomical connectivity (e.g., voxel-wise comparisons of fMRI data, where distance between voxels may influence correlation strength based on the anatomy/structure-function relationships of the sampled neural structures) ( ). \n\nTo characterize topological aspects of functional connectivity, we classified the significantly correlated unit pairs based on their gross anatomical locations as well as the electrode from which their correlated units were discriminated. Gross anatomical locations included the superficial dorsal horn (sDH), ranging from the dorsal surface of the spinal cord to ~400 μm in depth and corresponding approximately to Rexed’s Laminae I–III; the deep dorsal horn (dDH), ranging from ~500 to 1000 μm and corresponding approximately to Rexed’s Laminae III/IV–VI; the IG, ranging from ~1100 to 1300 μm, corresponding to Rexed’s Laminae VII–VIII; and the VH, ranging from ~1400 to 1600+ μm and including Rexed’s Laminae VIII–IX. We define the ‘most connected nodes’ for a given trial as the electrodes containing a significantly greater number of significant unit-pair connections than the mean number of connections across all electrodes in the microelectrode array. \n\n\n### Synthetic data \n  \nWe generated large synthetic datasets that matched the broad statistical properties of our observed data to use as an additional means of comparison and analyses ( ). The details of our approach to creating this synthetic dataset have been described previously ( ;  ). Briefly, however, the procedure is as follows. After performing spike sorting on each electrode channel for a given trial, we arrived at   N   spike trains (where   N   corresponds to the number of units discriminated during the spike sorting process for that trial). We then randomly selected a single number from one of two uniform distributions (see next paragraph) and added that value to the first spike time for, say, Unit 1. For example, if the first spike of Unit 1 occurred exactly 1 s after recording commenced, and we randomly drew a value of +3 ms, we would restate the first spike time for Unit 1 as occurring at 1.003 s after recording began. We then randomly drew another number from the same distribution (numbers were replaced after each draw) and added that value to the second spike time of Unit 1. This process continued for all spike times for Unit 1 during the trial. We refer to this process as jittering. The same process was subsequently performed for   all units   discriminated in that trial, resulting in   N   jittered spike trains. After jittering all spike times for all units for a single trial, we arrived at a ‘synthetic’ trial. We then re-ran the correlation analyses on the jittered spike trains in the synthetic trial. By repeating this process 1000× for each unit, trial, and rat, we developed a large synthetic dataset from which statistical confidence intervals could be derived and hypothesis testing could be performed. \n\nWe created two synthetic datasets, each designed to test a different aspect of connectivity. The first synthetic dataset was designed to test short-latency connectivity, as would be observed with mono-, di-, and minimally polysynaptic connections. For this dataset, we jittered the real data using a distribution of ±[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5] ms. These values simulate perturbations to short-latency interactions while preserving each unit’s firing rate at a broad timescale. The second synthetic dataset was designed to test latencies compatible with complex, highly polysynaptic interactions, and used a jittering distribution of ±50 ms (also with 1 ms granularity; i.e., draw a random number from [−50,–49, −48, … 48, 49, 50] ms). The overall number of spikes per unit was not changed in either jittering procedure so as to avoid confounds in the interpretation of our correlation results. \n\n\n### Statistical methods \n  \nStatistical inference beyond that required for the determination of significant temporal connections between pairs of co-active units (described above) is largely based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques for both the urethane and isoflurane cohorts. The normality of each dataset was confirmed prior to performing ANOVAs. For within-cohort comparisons, a main effect of anatomical region on the mean number of units, proportion of significant connections, or proportion of most connected nodes (respectively) was inferred using one-way repeated measures ANOVA formulations. Assessment of the potential significance of anatomical region (within-subjects factor), anesthetic (between-subjects factor), and their interaction on the proportion of excitatory and inhibitory connections was conducted using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA design. If data violated the assumption of sphericity, Greenhouse–Geisser correction was applied. The family-wise error rate of post-hoc testing was controlled through Bonferroni correction for all comparisons. Student’s t-tests were used to determine differences between individual (non-repeated) factors. This included comparisons of the proportion of within-region vs. between-region connections for a given cohort, comparisons of the mean number of units discriminated per animal between the cohorts, and excitatory vs. inhibitory latencies for a given cohort. For both ANOVA-based and t-test-based analyses, comparisons were considered significant at the α = 0.05 level. Data are presented in text as mean ± standard error unless otherwise noted. All statistical tests were performed in the IBM SPSS environment. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Vigorous spontaneous activity in single units remains evident throughout sensory and motor regions of the spinal gray matter during unconsciousness \n  \nWe focus on urethane anesthetized animals because urethane potently suppresses spontaneous discharge in the dorsal roots (minimizing undue afferent activity) while only modestly impacting resting membrane potential, GABA-ergic, and excitatory amino acid transmission ( ;  ). Thus, urethane enables characterization of the spinal cord in a state more representative of physiological activity than many other anesthetic agents. \n\nFirst, we quantified the gross anatomical distribution of spontaneously active units. In total, we recorded from approximately 860 well-isolated units across 13 urethane-anesthetized rats, averaging 66 ± 8 units per trial (e.g.,  ). This per-animal average number of units corresponds to approximately two units discriminated per electrode across the array, with a range from 0 to ~5 units per electrode. These findings are consistent with the initial validation data for the wave_clus package, which was developed with three neurons per electrode as the benchmark ( ). They are also consistent with subsequent studies using wave_clus with similar electrodes to ours, which show that 1–4 units are typically discriminated and that 5–6 units can be discriminated effectively without missed clusters or false positives ( ;  ). \n\nA representative raster plot from one trial is shown in  . Spontaneously active units can be observed throughout the dorsoventral extent of the sampled region. Broadly distributed, robust discharge was a consistent feature of all animals. Across the urethane cohort, the mean number of spontaneously active units discriminated per gross anatomical region per trial was: sDH: 11 ± 3; dDH: 25 ± 3; IG: 16 ± 2; VH: 14 ± 2 ( ). We found a significant main effect of region on connection number (F = 6.368, p=0.001), which was driven by a significantly greater number of units in the dDH than the sDH or VH. No other regions differed from one another ( , tab 1a). \n   Spontaneous neural transmission is broadly evident across all spatial and functional regions of the spinal gray matter.  \n(  a  ) Raster plot of spontaneously active neurons. Each row of hatches represents a discrete neuron. Inset depicts representative spike waveforms discriminated from a single electrode. X-axes (time) are synchronized across the two subplots. (  b  ) Distribution of spontaneously active units per gross anatomical region across animals in the urethane cohort (μ ± sem;   N   = 13 animals). The deep dorsal horn contained significantly more spontaneously active units on average than the superficial dorsal horn or ventral horn, driving an overall main effect of region (p=0.001). \n  \n\n### Spontaneous functional connectivity remains evident in intrinsic spinal networks during unconsciousness, enabling persistent communication between functionally and spatially diverse regions of the spinal gray matter \n  \nNext, we asked whether pairs of spontaneously active units exhibited correlated discharge patterns. Statistical matrices of unit-pair correlations for a 5 min epoch with a high degree of connectivity can be seen in  . In  , each pixel’s color represents the magnitude of correlation between the two units defined by an x–y pair; connection polarity is not indicated (although see  ).   indicates the p-values of the correlations. Across all animals and epochs in the urethane cohort, 4.2 ± 0.8% of unit pairs exhibited significantly correlated temporal discharge patterns. \n   Spontaneously active units exhibit temporal synchrony.  \nFor both plots, rows and columns are ordered from 1   N  , where   N   is the total number of units discriminated for a given trial. (  a  ) Strength of temporal correlation between pairs co-active units, indicated by pixel color. Pixels below identity line are omitted because reciprocal connections were not considered. (  b  ) Statistical matrix of correlation strength show in panel (  a  ). White pixels represent statistically significant correlations, here defined as those with p-values ≤ 0.02. Of the 66 total spontaneously active units discriminated in this epoch, and thus 2145 possible unique connections (ignoring reciprocal connections), 438 pairs exhibited significantly correlated temporal discharge. \n     Topology of spontaneously synchronous unit pairs is not relegated to regions of primary afferent terminations, rather it links sensory- and motor-dominant regions of the spinal cord.  \nRepresentative functional connectivity maps from two animals (panels   a   and   b   from same animal; panel   c   from separate animal). For all topology plots (  a–c  ): spinal cord inset image in panel (  a  ) shows electrode location. Gray circles represent individual electrodes on the microelectrode array. Green highlighted circles were determined to be the most connected nodes of the recording. Colored lines represent significantly correlated temporal discharge between pairs of spontaneously active units at the indicated locations (note: horizontal lines indicate connections between units discriminated from a single electrode, vertical lines are connections between units on the same shank). For panels (  a  ) and (  b  ), line color delineates increasing correlation strength from blue to violet; for panel (  c  ), red lines indicate putative excitatory connections, blue lines indicate putative inhibitory connections. In panels (  a  ) and (  b  ), histograms depict the following (top to bottom): purple histograms indicate the overall anatomical distribution of significant connections (in order left to right: sDH-sDH, sDH-dDH, sDH-IG, sDH-VH, dDH-dDH, dDH-IG, dDH-VH, IG-IG, IG-VH, VH-VH); green histograms indicate the gross anatomical distribution of most connected nodes (in order left to right: sDH, dDH, IG, VH); and red/blue histograms indicate the distribution of putative excitatory and inhibitory connections, respectively, in same order as purple histograms above. Black arrows in panel (  c  ), inhibitory connections, are intended simply to highlight the preponderance of within-electrode connections. sDH: superficial dorsal horn; dDH: deep dorsal horn; IG: intermediate gray matter; VH: ventral horn. \n  \nWe then sought to determine the gross anatomical organization of synchronous unit pairs. To do so, we constructed functional connectivity maps that enabled topological aspects of the correlation structure to be visualized in the context of the microelectrode array geometry and location within the spinal cord. Because it is not possible to know if the units were synaptically coupled, we adopt the term   functional   connectivity to refer to significant temporal synchrony between unit pairs. \n\n depicts examples of such intraspinal functional connectivity maps from two representative animals.   depicts   all   significant connections, regardless of polarity;   highlights the topology of excitatory and inhibitory connections from  . In   (red), we show only the significant excitatory connections from the animal in  ; in   (blue), we show putative inhibitory connections, also from the animal in  . In both figures, gray circles represent each electrode on the microelectrode array, referred to as ‘nodes.’ Green highlighted circles in   were determined to be the most connected nodes of the array (see Materials and methods). Qualitatively, it is evident from   that pairs of temporally correlated, spontaneously active units can be found (  a  ) at all sampled dorsoventral depths, (  b  ) within each gross anatomical region, and (  c  ) between all anatomical regions. \n\nSummary functional connectivity data from all animals in the urethane cohort can be seen in   and  . The proportion of significant connections   within   regions, at 68.9%, was significantly greater than the proportion of between-region connections, 31.1% (p<0.0001;  ). We also found a main effect of anatomical region on the proportion of significant connections detected across all regions (F = 9.277, p<0.0001;  ,  , tab 1b;  ). This effect was driven (a) by pairs of units   within   the dDH, IG, and VH, which accounted for the highest overall proportion of connections (24.9 ± 3.6, 17.3 ± 3.7, and 17.4 ± 3.7%, respectively), and (b) by sDH-IG and sDH-VH pairs, which exhibited the lowest proportion of significant connections (1.5% and 1.2%, respectively). Predictably, the proportion of significant connections was inversely related to connection distance. For example, sDH-sDH, sDH-dDH, sDH-IG, and sDH-VH connections account for 9.3, 6.3, 1.5, and 1.2% of overall significant connections. \n   Summary of topological data for urethane-anesthetized animals.  \n(  a  ) Proportion of significant connections by anatomical region (  N   = 13 animals). From left to right, bar plots indicate connections from sDH-sDH, sDH-dDH, sDH-IG, sDH-VH, dDH-dDH, dDH-IG, dDH-VH, IG-IG, IG-VH, and VH-VH. Darkening color gradient from left to right qualitatively indicates depth from dorsal surface of spinal cord. Grayscale plots are the proportion of within- and between-region connections, respectively. Significant connections are not uniformly distributed anatomically, with an overall main effect of connection location (p<0.0001) and significantly more within-region than between-region connections (p<0.0001). (  b  ) Gross anatomical distribution of the most connected nodes (  N   = 13 animals). From top to bottom (light to dark): sDH, dDH, IG, and VH.

(  d  ) Spatial distribution: proportion of significant connections by polarity (excitatory, inhibitory) and anatomical region. Red bars: putative excitatory connections; blue bars: putative inhibitory connections. (  e  ) Temporal distribution: latencies of significant excitatory (red) and inhibitory (blue) connections.

Inhibitory latencies were significantly shorter than excitatory latencies on average (p=0.0003). sDH: superficial dorsal horn; dDH: deep dorsal horn; IG: intermediate gray matter; VH: ventral horn. \n \n   Summary of topological data for urethane-anesthetized animals.  \n(  a  ) Proportion of significant connections by anatomical region (  N   = 13 animals). From left to right, bar plots indicate connections from sDH-sDH, sDH-dDH, sDH-IG, sDH-VH, dDH-dDH, dDH-IG, dDH-VH, IG-IG, IG-VH, and VH-VH. Darkening color gradient from left to right qualitatively indicates depth from dorsal surface of spinal cord. Grayscale plots are the proportion of within- and between-region connections, respectively. Significant connections are not uniformly distributed anatomically, with an overall main effect of connection location (p<0.0001) and significantly more within-region than between-region connections (p<0.0001). (  b  ) Gross anatomical distribution of the most connected nodes (  N   = 13 animals). From top to bottom (light to dark): sDH, dDH, IG, and VH. Significant main effect of anatomical region on proportion of most connected nodes, p=0.009. This figure is analogous to   in the main body; however, here we present raw data (gray circles) superimposed onto the summary bar plots. sDH: superficial dorsal horn; dDH: deep dorsal horn; IG: intermediate gray matter; VH: ventral horn. \n  \n \nThe gross anatomical connectivity results were also reflected in the distribution of the most connected nodes. Nodes in the dDH were classified as belonging to the most connected group in a greater proportion of trials (35.4 ± 4.6%) than nodes in the sDH (14.1 ± 4.3%), IG (27.4 ± 4.4%), or VH (23.0 ± 3.9%), driving an overall main effect of anatomical region on the distribution of most connected nodes (F = 4.333, p=0.009;  ,  , tab 1c). It should be noted, however, that the dDH comprised a relatively larger dorsoventral extent than did the other regions, and thus contained a greater number of nodes. This contributed to the greater proportion of connections attributed to it. To this point, in  , we show a histogram of the most connected nodes across the 32-channel microelectrode array. While a clear increase in counts is evident moving from dorsal-most to ventral-most, many individual electrodes in the IG or VH exhibited a higher occurrence of being ‘most connected’ than those in the dDH (see Discussion). \n\nFinally, we characterized the distribution of putative excitatory and inhibitory connections. In  , we highlight their anatomical distribution. We found that connections within the dDH, within the IG, and within the VH contained the highest proportion of putative inhibitory connections (22.7 ± 5.3%, 24.1 ± 7.3%, and 37.8 ± 9.0%, respectively), with the dDH containing the highest proportion of excitatory connections (25.9 ± 3.7%). Interestingly, only the dDH displayed an approximately balanced proportion of excitation and inhibition – that is, nearly the same proportion of the overall number of putative excitatory connections as overall putative inhibitory connections. \n\nAlthough it is striking that the highest percentage of inhibitory connections were all within specific regions rather than between regions, this may be a practical consequence of the extracellular recording technique: detection of inhibitory connections via correlation-based approaches is notoriously challenging, in part because both cells must have a relatively high and stable base firing rate to detect a reduction in firing. Functional connectivity, which includes many polysynaptic pathways, makes detection more difficult still. Thus, some of the differences we observed in the within-vs. between-region distribution of inhibitory connections may reflect these experimental elements and should not be interpreted exclusively as a physiological feature of spinal network structure. The relative balance of inhibitory connections may also change with sensorimotor reflex activation, volitional movement, nociceptive transmission, etc., even using extracellular recording techniques. \n\nThe distribution of latencies between each statistically significant connection is shown in  . Mean excitatory latency was significantly longer than the mean inhibitory latency, at 6.4 ± 0.6 ms vs. 2.7 ± 0.4 ms (p=0.0003), with both categories including latencies consistent with putative mono-, di-, and polysynaptic pathways. Interestingly, we find a subset of both excitatory and inhibitory connections with latencies between 0 and 1 ms. While some of these connections could indeed be monosynaptic and the lower-than-expected delay merely related to binning spikes, the most likely interpretation for coincidentally firing unit pairs would be a shared presynaptic input. While the distribution of inhibitory latencies contained was skewed towards an increased probability of observing putative mono- and disynaptic connections, this apparent disparity may also be related to the aforementioned challenging of detecting inhibition via extracellular recording techniques. \n\n\n### Functional connectivity within and between deep regions of the spinal gray matter is not abolished by preferential pharmacological depression \n  \nThe finding of robust functional connectivity between sensory-dominant dorsal horn regions and the IG and VH was unexpected. Especially intriguing was the presence of vigorous neural transmission within the IG and VH themselves. Although urethane profoundly depresses spontaneous discharge in the dorsal root ganglia, it exerts less of a depressive effect on cells deep in the gray matter (i.e., the IG and VH) ( ;  ). To control for the potential influence of this anesthetic gradient on our findings, we conducted an additional set of experiments in a cohort of eight rats anesthetized with isoflurane. Isoflurane is a more potent depressant of spinal motor activity than urethane, with an overall gradient of depression that increases from the dorsal horn to the VH ( ). For example, while nociceptive pathways in the sDH remain largely uninhibited by isoflurane, premotor interneurons and motoneurons in the VH are markedly depressed ( ). Mean intraspinal resting motor threshold confirmed the greater depression of VH cells by isoflurane than urethane (isoflurane threshold: 20.4 μA; urethane threshold 14.0 μA). \n\nIn total, we recorded from 484 well-isolated units across the nine rats, translating to ~51 ± 2 units per trial. The mean number of units recorded per trial did not differ between the urethane and the isoflurane cohorts (p=0.0718). A representative raster plot of spontaneous neural activity from one trial is shown in  . Surprisingly, spontaneously active units were observed throughout the dorsoventral extent of the sampled region in all animals, including the IG and VH. The mean numbers of units per region are as follows: sDH: 9 ± 2, dDH: 20 ± 3, IG: 12 ± 1, VH: 13 ± 1 (main effect of region: F = 6.650, p=0.001;  ,  , tab 1d). In  , we show a representative functional connectivity map for the isoflurane cohort. \n   Vigorous spontaneous sensorimotor functional connectivity persists despite preferential depression of ventral horn (VH) cells.  \n(  a  ) Raster plot of spontaneously active neurons from a representative isoflurane-anesthetized animal. Each row of hatches represents a discrete neuron. X-axes (time) are synchronized across the two subplots. (  b  ) Distribution of spontaneously active units per gross anatomical region across animals in the isoflurane cohort (  N   = 9 animals). The deep dorsal horn contained significantly more spontaneously active units on average than the superficial dorsal horn or VH, driving an overall main effect of region (p=0.001). (  c  ) Representative functional connectivity map from panel (  a  ). Gray circles represent individual electrodes on the microelectrode array (as in  ). Green highlighted circles were determined to be the most connected nodes of the recording. Colored lines represent significantly correlated temporal discharge between pairs of spontaneously active units at the indicated locations (note: horizontal lines indicate connections between units discriminated from a single electrode, vertical lines are connections between units on the same shank). Line color delineates increasing correlation strength from blue to violet. \n  \nSummary data from the isoflurane cohort can be seen in   and  . Here, we show the gross anatomical distribution of significant connections. Similar to the urethane cohort, we observed a significantly greater proportion of connections   within   regions (66.4%) than across regions (33.6%) (p=0.005), and an overall main effect of anatomical region (e.g., sDH-sDH, sDH-dDH) on the proportion of significant connections (F = 6.517, p<0.0001;  , tab 1e). Interestingly, despite the different mechanisms of action and depressive profiles of the two anesthetics, we found no systematic difference in the proportion of significant connections per region across the urethane and isoflurane cohorts (anesthetic by region interaction: F = 0.369, p=0.949; main effect of anesthetic: F = 0.631, p=0.436); rather, all were within 1.8% of one another on average (range, 4–6%,  ). The distribution of most connected nodes in the isoflurane cohort also mirrored that of the urethane cohort. Specifically, the largest proportion of most connected nodes was found in the dDH (34.2%), the lowest in the sDH (13.2%), with 22.6% in the IG and 30.0% in the VH. There was a significant main effect of region on most connected node (F = 4.935, p=0.006;  , tab 1f;  ). Together, these findings provide additional confirmation of the presence of persistent, synchronous discharge between functionally and spatially different regions of the spinal gray matter during unconsciousness. That such activity persisted in the IG and VH with isoflurane also underscores the apparent robustness of the finding. \n   Summary of topological data for isoflurane-anesthetized animals.  \n(  a  ) Proportion of significant connections by anatomical region (  N   = 9 animals). From left to right, bar plots indicate connections from sDH-sDH, sDH-dDH, sDH-IG, sDH-VH, dDH-dDH, dDH-IG, dDH-VH, IG-IG, IG-VH, and VH-VH.

Vertical axis represents the difference in proportion of connections between the two cohorts; positive values: more significant connections in the urethane cohort; negative values: more significant connections in the isoflurane cohort.

This figure is analogous to   in the main body; however, here we present raw data (gray circles) superimposed onto the summary bar plots. sDH: superficial dorsal horn; dDH: deep dorsal horn; IG: intermediate gray matter; VH: ventral horn. \n  \n \nThe anatomical distribution of excitatory and inhibitory links also remained remarkably stable between urethane and isoflurane ( ). There was no main effect of anesthetic agent nor an interaction of drug by region for either the proportion of excitatory or inhibitory links in each region (excitatory: region: F = 13.981, p=0.000; region*drug: F = 0.348, p=0.819; drug: F = 0.030, p=0.865,  , tab 1g; inhibitory: region: F = 19.403; p=0.000; region*drug: F = 0.231, p=0.794; drug: F = 0.611, p=0.444,  , tab 1h). The mean latency of excitatory and inhibitory connections also did not change from the urethane to the isoflurane cohorts (excitatory: 6.4 ± 0.5 vs. 6.7 ± 1 ms, p=0.8188; inhibitory: 2.6 ± 0.4 vs. 3.1 ± 0.6 ms, p=0.5389). Within the isoflurane cohort, inhibitory latencies were significantly shorter than excitatory latencies (p=0.017;  ), which was also reflected when pooling data across both cohorts (i.e., inhibitory latencies were significantly shorter than excitatory latencies on average at 2.9 vs. 6.5 ms, p  <  0.0001). \n\n\n### The magnitude and spatiotemporal profile of unconscious intraspinal functional connectivity is not explained by random network activity \n  \nBecause these experiments characterize spontaneous rather than evoked network activity, it is reasonable to question whether the activity is likely to emerge merely by chance. To address this question, we first asked whether the proportion of significantly correlated unit pairs was greater than that which would be expected by an interconnected population of statistically matched neurons firing randomly. We addressed this question in a twofold manner, first by comparing the observed data to a synthetic dataset designed to jitter short-latency interactions and second by comparing the observed data to a synthetic dataset designed to jitter long-latency interactions. Across animals, we find that the mean proportion of significantly correlated unit pairs in the synthetic datasets was significantly lower than that observed experimentally (urethane: short-latency synthetic: 2.7 ± 0.4%, long-latency synthetic: 2.6 ± 0.5%, experimentally observed: 4.2 ± 0.8%, p=0.0053; isoflurane: short-latency synthetic: 2.7 ± 1.1%, long-latency synthetic: 2.6 ± 0.5%, experimentally observed, 3.9 ± 1.3, p=0.0033). On a per-animal level, we find that the proportion of significant connections in the observed data always exceeded its synthetic counterpart; that is, in no animals did we detect only as few (or fewer) significant connections than would be expected at random when controlling for the uniqueness of each animal’s own data. These findings indicate that the overall degree of temporal synchrony was highly unlikely to be observed at random. \n\nNext, we asked whether the spatial patterns of connectivity – that is, the topology of the significantly correlated unit pairs – differed from a random structure. Given the consistent surgical placement of our microelectrode arrays in each experiment, their known geometry, and our definitions of the approximate boundaries between gross anatomical regions in the spinal gray matter, it is possible to directly compute the probabilities that significant connections will exist within or between regions if neurons are distributed at random. In our paradigm, the number of electrodes per region is: sDH: 8; dDH: 12; IG: 6; VH: 6. These values can be seen in  . We are interested in all within- and between-region connections as a matter of combinations, not permutations (i.e., sDH-DH connections are the same as dDH-sDH connections). \n\nAssuming that neurons are randomly (albeit uniformly) distributed throughout the sampled gray matter, the expected value for each regional comparison is the ratio of the number of electrodes represented in a given comparison to the total number of electrodes represented across all comparisons. For example, the expected percentage of dDH-dDH connections is arrived at by dividing 12, the number of electrodes in the regional comparison, by 128, the total number of electrodes represented across all combinations. Note that the overall total (128) is not the same as the number of electrodes on the array itself (32). This difference is because we are including comparisons between regions in addition to comparisons within regions. Expected values for   overall   within-region and between-region connectivity are the sum of the individual regional percentages. Theoretical probabilities are: sDH-sDH: 6.3%; sDH-dDH: 15.6%; sDH-IG: 10.9%; sDH-VH: 10.9%; dDH-dDH: 9.4%; dDH-IG: 14.1%; dDH-VH: 14.1%; IG-IG:4.7%; IG-VH: 9.4%; and VH-VH: 4.7%. For within- and between-region connections, the probabilities are 25 and 75%, respectively. We then verified that the bootstrapped synthetic data indeed converged to these theoretical predictions ( ). \n   Experimentally realized spatial patterns of functional connectivity diverge from predictions of random network interactions.  \n(  a  ) Proportion of significant connections by anatomical region. From left to right, bar plots indicate connections from sDH-sDH, sDH-dDH, sDH-IG, sDH-VH, dDH-dDH, dDH-IG, dDH-VH, IG-IG, IG-VH, and VH-VH. Black bars indicate theoretical predictions; white bars indicate results of simulations ± sem (i.e., synthetic data). The synthetic dataset, generated from randomly shuffling by ±0–5 ms each spike time of each neuron in each trial, then repeating >1000 ×, converges to theoretical predictions. Theoretical predictions are based upon the number and anatomical distribution of electrodes throughout the gray matter. (  b  ) Anatomical distribution of synthetic data (white, as in panel   a  ) compared to experimentally realized urethane data (  N = 13,   purple bars). We found a significant interaction of cohort by anatomical region (real vs. synthetic, p<0.0001), indicating the divergence of the real dataset from that which would be expected by a population of interconnected neurons that are statistically similar but spiking at random. Asterisks indicate connections in which the synthetic data was overrepresented relative to the real data; crosses indicate connections in which the real data was overrepresented relative to the synthetic data. Most notably, we found significantly more within-region connections in the real data compared to the synthetic (p<0.0001), and significantly fewer between region connections in the real compared to the synthetic data (p<0.0001). sDH: superficial dorsal horn; dDH: deep dorsal horn; IG: intermediate gray matter; VH: ventral horn. \n\n\n  \nWe found an overall main effect of anatomical region on connectivity patterns between the bootstrapped synthetic data and the observed data (urethane: F = 10.571, p<0.0001,  ,  , tab 1i; isoflurane: F = 7.251, p=0.001,  , tab 1j) and, notably, a significant interaction of region by cohort (i.e., real or synthetic urethane data; F = 16.168; p<0.0001  , tab 1i; isoflurane: F = 11.561, p<0.0001,  , tab 1j). Post-hoc testing across regions revealed a lower proportion of significant sDH-dDH, sDH-IG, sDH-VH, dDH-IG, and dDH-VH connections in the real compared to the synthetic dataset and a significantly greater proportion of dDH-dDH, IG-IG, and VH-VH connections in the observed compared to the synthetic dataset ( ). Overall, we found a significantly greater proportion of within-region connections in the observed dataset than the synthetic dataset (68.9 vs. 26.3%, p<0.0001) and a significantly lower proportion of between-region connections in the observed dataset compared to the synthetic dataset (31.1 vs. 73.7%, p<0.0001). \n\n\n### Absence of latent sensory afferent feedback suggests an intrinsic spinal source of the persistent network activity \n  \nLatent sensory afferent feedback could provide an input to spinal networks during unconsciousness. If sufficiently vigorous, this feedback could lead to activation of a diverse population of spinal interneurons and confound the interpretation of whether an intrinsic spinal source gave rise to the persistent network activity we observed. To determine whether this was likely to be the case, we conducted a further set of validation experiments in two rats ( ). \n   Spontaneous baseline electroneurographic (ENG) activity in the sciatic nerve is minimal and unaltered by nerve block.  \n(  a  ) Schematic diagram of recording site and relevant anatomical features. Yellow line indicates the nerve; we recorded sciatic nerve ENG using a hook electrode located at site #1, proximal to the bifurcation into tibial and peroneal nerves; site #2 represents the common peroneal nerve, site #3 represents the sural nerve, and site #4 the tibial nerve. (  b  ) Representative ENG activity in the absence of sensory stimulation, as during intraspinal recording sessions. No spontaneous action potential discharge is present, and ENG amplitude is minimal and constant. (  c  ) Large bursts of high-amplitude ENG are induced by cutaneous stimulation of the L4–L6 dermatomes. Stimulation epochs are indicated by the top-most horizontal bars, and the dots above the ENG are rasters of individual spikes discriminated from the compound action potential/multi-unit ENG waveforms. The horizontal dashed line indicates the average ENG amplitude during bursts of induced sensory transmission, and the solid horizontal line below it indicates the average ENG amplitude during periods   without   sensory stimulation plus 3× its standard deviation. (  d  ) Identical in layout to panel (  c  ), with proprioceptive feedback rather than cutaneous. The ankle was plantarflexed and held, dorsiflexed and held, and then alternated between plantarflexion and dorsiflexion. (  e  ) Top panel: sciatic nerve ENG recording during periods of induced sensory transmission (horizontal black bars) and baseline transmission prior to lidocaine nerve block. Bottom panel (left): baseline ENG 30 min after epineurial lidocaine injection, showing a lack of spontaneous action potential discharge and minimal amplitude. Bottom panel (right): minimal ENG during attempted induction of sensory transmission confirms efficacy of nerve block. (  f  ) Spontaneous baseline ENG amplitude is indistinguishable before (black) and during (gray) nerve block, and is 16.7× smaller than average peak ENG amplitude during bursts of induced sensory transmission before the block (white). Note: the y-axis scales are the same for all plots in (  b  –  e  ). \n  \nIn these rats, we implanted a recording electrode around the ipsilateral sciatic nerve proximal to its bifurcation ( ) and recorded spontaneous baseline ENG ( ; as during the intraspinal recording sessions) and ENG during periods of induced cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory transmission ( ). In the anesthetized,   unblocked   state, action potential discharge was not evident during periods without sensory stimulation ( ). Overall ENG amplitude was also negligible during these periods, and its standard deviation remained constant. \n\nWe then mechanically probed the L4–L6 dermatomes to quantify potential differences in afferent transmission between periods with sensory stimulation and those without. Representative epochs of each type are shown in  . In  , we show ENG in response to light touch of the L4–L6 dermatomes, including over regions of glabrous and of hairy skin. Dots above the ENG are rasters of individual spikes discriminated from the compound action potential/multi-unit ENG activity. In  , we show ENG during periods of induced proprioceptive transmission as we plantarflex and dorsiflex (and hold, as indicated) the ankle. In both panels, the horizontal dashed line indicates the average ENG amplitude during bursts of induced sensory transmission, and the solid horizontal line below it indicates the average ENG amplitude during periods   without   sensory stimulation plus 3× its standard deviation. During epochs between delivery of sensory stimuli, the hindlimb rested gently on a pad with the plantar surface of the hindpaw facing upwards, as during our intraspinal recording sessions (which is also the same as in  ). Note that no persistent or spontaneously arising action potential discharge is evident during epochs between sensory stimulation; that is, the nerve returns to quiescence. \n\nWe then enveloped the multiunit ENG (gray lines over the ENG; 250 ms envelope window) and extracted amplitude and variability metrics for periods of spontaneous baseline ENG and induced sensory transmission. Across modalities of induced sensory transmission, bursts of multi-unit ENG had an average peak amplitude 16.7× (±0.82 sem) greater than the average amplitude of spontaneous baseline ENG (  N   = 51 pairs). The average ENG amplitude across each period of sensory stimulation (not the average peak amplitude, as previously reported) was 3.09× (±0.17 sem) greater than the sum of the spontaneous baseline ENG amplitude and its standard deviation. \n\nNext, we blocked afferent transmission via epineurial lidocaine injection. In the top panel of  , we show periods of induced sensory transmission and interleaved periods of spontaneous baseline ENG prior to nerve block. In the bottom-left panel of  , we show a representative epoch of neural data recorded 30 min after lidocaine injection. No sensory stimulation was delivered during this epoch, and spontaneous action potential discharge expectedly remained absent. In the bottom-right panel of  , we confirm the blocking effect of lidocaine injection by attempting to induce sensory transmission. Qualitatively, it is evident that the spontaneous baseline ENG is indistinguishable pre- and post-block (  vs.  ). This similarity is represented quantitatively in  , which shows that the average spontaneous baseline ENG before the block (black bar) is indistinguishable from that during the block (gray bar).   also depicts the average peak ENG burst amplitude across trials (white bar) to provide reference for the observed spontaneous baseline ENG amplitude. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Presence of an intrinsic spinal network active during unconsciousness \n  \nOur primary finding is that neural transmission persists in the spinal cord during unconsciousness at a level and with a structure that appears to be non-random. We interpret our findings as supporting the emerging view that the spinal cord possesses intrinsic networks that maintain functionality during unconsciousness and in the absence of evoked neural transmission ( ;  ). \n\nIn intrinsic   surpra  spinal networks, functional neural transmission during unconsciousness involves patterned activity within local and regional circuits as well as communication between functionally and spatially distributed neural structures ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Thus, we reasoned that persistence of correlated discharge at multiple spatial scales would also be a necessary precondition for intrinsic spinal networks to maintain functionality during unconsciousness. Central to this idea would be the presence of non-random functional connectivity within sensorimotor regions deep in the gray matter (in addition to connectivity within and between the predominantly sensory regions of the dorsal horn) as the spinal cord plays a key role in sensorimotor integration and motor output. \n\nTo this point, we found a greater proportion of connectivity within the VH than within or between any other region(s) except within the dDH, despite a lack of motor output. Connections within the IG were the third most represented (behind dDH-dDH and VH-VH). Of particular note is the proportion of VH-VH connections relative to dDH-dDH connections. While it is perhaps not surprising that the dDH exhibited the greatest interconnectivity given that it forms both local and distributed circuits and receives direct primary afferent input, it is however surprising that, when normalized for anatomical area, the dDH exhibits only ~60% as much within-region connectivity as the VH. \n\nPrevious studies have found resting state functional connectivity within the dorsal horns and the VH, respectively, but it has been an enduring question whether functional connectivity exists between the dorsal horn and other regions of the spinal gray matter during unconsciousness, particularly in the absence of evoked responses ( ;  ;  ;  ). Remarkably, we found that >20% of all significant connections were between the sDH or dDH and the IG or VH (e.g.,  ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such demonstration of single-neuron-level spontaneous functional connectivity between sensory and motor regions of the spinal gray matter during unconsciousness. From these findings, we can conclude that spontaneous synchronous discharge of spinal neurons during unconsciousness is not confined to local, sensory-dominant circuits in the dorsal horn; rather, it spans spatially and functionally distinct regions of the spinal gray matter, reflecting the integrative nature of spinal neural transmission during periods of wakeful behavior. \n\nDetermining whether the connectivity we see truly reflects the presence of orderly activity in an intrinsic spinal network during unconsciousness is a complex process, in part because of the potential role of sensory afferent inflow. On the other hand, the presence of nominal sensory inflow does not itself exclude the possibility that intrinsic activity was maintained; merely that the observed activity reflects the interaction of the two. This would be analogous to studies of resting state functional connectivity in the brain during inattentive wakefulness (e.g., the default mode network), where environmental stimuli and sensory feedback are continuously present, but lack saliency ( ). Nevertheless, several lines of experimental controls and results support our conclusion that the observed connectivity was not due merely to sensory afferent inflow. \n\nThe most direct evidence in support of a primary role for intrinsic spinal sources as opposed to a primary contribution from sensory afferent feedback comes from the peripheral nerve ( ). Recording from the sciatic nerve proximal to its bifurcation ( , site #1), we found no evidence of spontaneous action potential discharge in fibers innervating the L4, L5, or L6 spinal segments ( ). The overall magnitude of spontaneous baseline ENG was also negligible, as evidenced by the 16.7× greater ENG amplitude observed during induced sensory transmission ( ). Importantly, the magnitude of ENG was also effectively constant when sensory stimulation was not being delivered, revealing no underlying multi-unit activity. The amplitude and standard deviation of the spontaneous baseline ENG in our preparation were also unchanged by pharmacological nerve block – a form of temporary deafferentation – further suggesting that latent sensory feedback was minimal ( ). \n\nWe next return to the finding of connectivity within and between the IG and VH. These regions would not be expected to receive meaningful direct afferent input in our preparation. The primary source of such input would be proprioceptive muscle and joint afferents, in particular the 1a, 1b, and group II fibers. While 1a afferents indeed synapse directly onto motoneurons, in our preparation muscle length was held constant. Activity in 1b and Group II afferents would likewise be negligible in our preparation, as muscles were not developing tension and were held in a neutral, unstrained position. Importantly,   highlight the differences between spontaneous baseline ENG (i.e., as during the intraspinal recordings) and ENG during periods of proprioceptive feedback, revealing an absence of proprioceptive transmission outside of periods in which it was specifically induced. \n\nAnother argument against an exclusive role of sensory feedback driving our connectivity results and in support of a role for persistent activity in an intrinsic network is that sDH and dDH connectivity was robust in animals anesthetized with urethane. As mentioned in Results, we chose urethane specifically for its documented ability to block spontaneous dorsal root activity ( ;  ). It is also worth reiterating that we chose an electrode implantation site whose corresponding dermatome primarily included the glaborous skin of the plantar surface of the hindpaw. This region had no physical contact with the surgical field, instruments, etc., further minimizing undue afferent feedback. Although physical deafferentation would have wholly eliminated natural sensory afferent activity, it could have paradoxically increased discharge in the residual dorsal roots, second-order neurons, or local dorsal horn neurons ( ). \n\nA counterpoint to this interpretation would be that the activity we observed within and between the IG and VH is related to polysynaptic activation of premotor interneurons and other interneurons intercalated amongst motor pools from latent connections to the sDH and dDH. We addressed this potential confound by characterizing functional connectivity in a separate cohort of rats anesthetized with isoflurane, an anesthetic known to preferentially depress VH cells relative to the dorsal horn cells, including premotor interneurons ( ;  ). We found that functional connectivity in the IG and VH (as well as the sDH and dDH) persisted largely unchanged in animals administered isoflurane, and therefore choice of anesthetic agent could not explain our findings. In fact, we find the spatiotemporal patterns of connectivity to be remarkably consistent across the two anesthetic agents. This finding, in conjunction with other experimental controls, further supports the notion that the results are not merely an epiphenomenon or primarily reflective of afferent transmission. \n\nSeparate from afferent feedback, some degree of spontaneous, possibly random, neural transmission would presumably be expected in the spinal cord regardless of whether a structured intrinsic network is active during unconsciousness. Therefore, it was important to understand how the observed proportion of functionally connected units and their topology compared to that which might be expected in populations of statistically similar interconnected neurons spiking randomly. We developed a series of large synthetic datasets to address these questions, finding an average of 105%   more   pairs of functionally connected units across rats in the observed compared to the synthetic datasets. This comparison is the most direct application of our synthetic datasets, and our findings indicate that the observed proportion of functionally connected units was unlikely to have occurred by chance. It also reinforces the view that the spinal cord indeed possesses intrinsic networks active during unconsciousness, which could be involved in multimodal neural processing. \n\nRegarding topological aspects of the correlated units, we also find a marked departure from a random structure. One of the most pronounced topological features of the observed data, particularly compared to theoretical benchmarks, was the different proportion of within-region vs. between-region connectivity. Indeed, we found significantly greater within-region connectivity than between-region connectivity overall (~70 vs. ~30%), opposite our prediction. However, interpreting whether the observed between-region connectivity is more or less than what would be expected at random is challenging because of uncertainties introduced by the nature of our experiments, and we urge caution in this regard. The primary reason for this uncertainty is that it is not possible to know what percentage of the total population of spontaneously active neurons our sample represents, which may also be affected by anesthetic depth – a variable we did not systematically explore. Comprehensively estimating what types of neurons and anatomical regions are most likely to exhibit spontaneous activity is likewise not possible. \n\nFrom a practical standpoint, the apparently increased prevalence of within-region connections compared to between-region connections could also be driven in part by the sDH. While the sDH contains the most theoretical between-region connections, it is a particularly challenging region to study in vivo using implanted microelectrode arrays. Indeed, its proximity to the electrode insertion site increases the likelihood of tissue damage, which is compounded by the small size and fragility of the cells it contains (e.g., in the substantia gelatinosa). The sDH also contains a preponderance of between-region circuits dedicated to transmission of nociceptive neural activity from the periphery, but nociception was not a component of our protocol. These considerations presumably reduced the overall proportion of between-region connections we observed, which was shifted further towards a majority of within-region connections by the fourfold overrepresentation of VH-VH connections. \n\nSeveral other factors also contribute. For example, in any neural system, one would predict increased synchrony amongst spatially co-localized neurons and less synchrony between spatially distant neurons. Thus, our ability to detect between-region connectivity using individual spike trains is presumably not uniform. The lack of overt stimuli and neural drive in our preparation also suggests that the discharge rate of spontaneously active units was likely lower than it would have been during awake, behaving conditions, rendering temporal correlation analyses more difficult due to fewer chances to observe coincident spikes. An additional consideration is that we did not characterize or predict higher-order connectivity patterns (e.g., 3, 4, 5 link connections). Together, these factors would have contributed to a preferential   underestimation   of between-region connectivity compared to within-region connectivity and could underlie a portion of the differences we see in the observed vs. synthetic datasets. \n\nThus, while we can conclude that the observed proportions of regional connectivities are non-random, non-zero, and that multiple local and distant regions are functionally connected (i.e., rejecting the null hypotheses of the analyses), we cannot delineate the specific pathways through which these connections are mediated nor can we directly contextualize the relative magnitude of the proportions themselves. Despite all of the above considerations, however, it is worth reiterating that approximately one in every five observed connections spanned sensory-dominant and motor-dominant regions. \n\n\n### Possible function(s) of neural transmission in intrinsic spinal networks during unconsciousness \n  \nOne potential explanation for the presence of persistent activity during unconsciousness could be reactivation of salient experience-dependent patterns of neural transmission to stabilize circuit-level synaptic connectivity. During sleep, for example, specific patterns of hippocampal and cortical activation emerge that mirror those experienced during wakefulness ( ;  ). Persistence of these patterns is believed to be integral to memory encoding and consolidation. It is reasonable to think that such a mechanism might be a generalized feature of complex neural circuits. \n\nSeveral of our findings are consistent with this idea and suggest putative mechanisms by which it could occur. First, our finding of functional connectivity between superficial and deep regions indicates that the pathways nominally required for stabilization of multimodal patterns of neutral transmission remain active during unconsciousness. Next, we find a substantial portion of connection latencies compatible with mono- and disynaptic interactions, offering a link between broad, network-level neural synchrony and the millisecond-timescale synaptic interactions necessary for driving plasticity and shaping behavior ( ;  ). And finally, we show that both excitatory and inhibitory connections with the full complement of latencies are widely distributed throughout the gray matter, providing another mechanism for bidirectional modification of synaptic interactions (besides spike-timing-dependent plasticity) to precisely shape circuit-level neural transmission and behavior. \n\nAlthough our study cannot confirm or refute whether this is indeed the purpose of the persistent network activity we observed, it is a useful framework for developing new hypotheses to probe this potential functionality. For example, we would hypothesize that if a specific salient pattern of neural transmission was introduced and reinforced prior to unconsciousness, whether naturally or as part of a targeted, plasticity-promoting rehabilitation intervention ( ;  ;  ), we may find evidence of this pattern in the topology of active neurons during unconsciousness. We would also hypothesize that specific patterns of functional connectivity during unconsciousness may play a role in the chronification process after trauma or disease. Here, network activity could potentially lead either to adaptive or maladaptive reinforcement of (in)appropriate patterns of neural activity, contributing to amelioration or persistence of debilitating sensory and motor impairments (e.g., spinal cord injury-related neuropathic pain; movement impairments after stroke, spinal cord injury, or multiple sclerosis). \n\nOther possible functions of persistent spontaneous connectivity during unconsciousness also exist. For example, it could reflect latent activity in spinal central pattern generators (although evidence for unconscious activity in these circuits has yet to be introduced to the literature). Alternatively, it could play a role in mediating inattentive physiological processes, qualitatively analogous to the default mode (or task-negative) network in the brain ( ;  ;  ) or interoceptive networks ( ;  ;  ). However, it is difficult to extrapolate our results to these latter two constructs because we interrogated rather granular connectivity within a single spinal segment and did not directly consider transmission between spinal and supraspinal centers or sympathetic outflow. Studies of spinal BOLD signaling may offer additional evidence in support of or against these theories. It is also possible that the persistent spontaneous activity is not directly involved in synaptic stabilization or in maintenance of ongoing physiological processes. Rather, it may reflect a nominal basal state of activity required simply to prevent undue extinction of learned patterns of neural transmission ( ). Nevertheless, our results suggest that structured spontaneous activity during unconsciousness is a fundamental property of complex neural systems and is not confined to supraspinal networks. \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"1a1f02f04a23c1bf3427120bdae124e0"},

Importantly our earlier results showed that white matter diffusion abnormalities and resting state functional activity were affected differently in the two subtypes of the disease, migraine with and without aura. Resting fluctuation of the BOLD signal in the white matter was reported recently. The question arising whether the white matter activity, that is strongly coupled with gray matter activity is also perturbed differentially in the two subtypes of the disease and if so, is it related to the microstructural alterations of the white matter. \n\n Methods:   Resting state fMRI, 60 directional DTI images and high-resolution T1 images were obtained from 51 migraine patients and 32 healthy volunteers. The images were pre-processed and the white matter was extracted. Independent component analysis was performed to obtain white matter functional networks. The differential expression of the white matter functional networks in the two subtypes of the disease was investigated with dual-regression approach. The Fourier spectrum of the resting fMRI fluctuations were compared between groups. Voxel-wise correlation was calculated between the resting state functional activity fluctuations and white matter microstructural measures. \n\n Results:   Three white matter networks were identified that were expressed differently in migraine with and without aura. Migraineurs with aura showed increased functional connectivity and amplitude of BOLD fluctuation. Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity showed strong correlation with the expression of the frontal white matter network in patients with aura. \n\n Discussion:   Our study is the first to describe changes in white matter resting state functional activity in migraine with aura, showing correlation with the underlying microstructure. Functional and structural differences between disease subtypes suggest at least partially different pathomechanism, which may necessitate handling of these subtypes as separate entities in further studies. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMigraine is the most widely known primary headache disorder, which affects nearly 10% of the population ( ). The clinical appearance of attack is similar in most cases, however 20% of the patients report focal neurological symptoms (aura) before headache (migraine with aura; MWA). Different theories claimed to explain the pathomechanism of MWA and migraine without aura (MWoA) and the two forms of the headache may have distinct triggers ( ). Malfunction of the trigemino-vascular complex, dysfunctional brainstem nuclei and altered metabolism of several neuropeptides may all play a part in the initiation of the migraineous headache. Aura symptoms are supposed to be originated from cortical spreading depression (CSD), a spreading wave of depolarization throughout the cortex that is thought to cause the focal symptoms associated with aura ( ). CSD that is more prevalent in MWA is reportedly associated with the imbalance of excitation/inhibition in the migrainous brain ( ). The altered excitability in MWA patients can cause increased amplitude of visual evoked potentials ( ,  ), and also altered motion perception, where they have to judge certain properties of stimuli against a noisy background ( ). Several studies also report enhanced responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimuli in a functional MRI setting ( ,  ). Functional imaging placed the differences between the two subtypes on new foundations. Such methods were able to detect CSD during the aura phase ( ,  ), and also revealed altered responses to sensory ( ) or painful stimuli ( – ). \n\nResting state fMRI showed conflicting results about the alterations of brain activity during rest in interictal period. While some studies presented increased connectivity ( ), some of them found the connectivity to be decreased ( ). The fact, that these studies used heterogeneous populations of both MWA and MWoA patients, might explain this discrepancy. Our earlier investigation showed that the amplitude of the resting BOLD fluctuation, presumably a signature of increased excitability, was increased in MWA but not in MWoA ( ). \n\nApart from gray matter functional networks, previous studies suggested that the white matter responds to external stimuli in a fashion similar to the gray matter, and this activation can also be measured with fMRI ( – ). Such fluctuations in activity are also present during rest, organized into distinct, consistently identifiable white matter resting state fMRI networks that bear close resemblance to gray matter functional networks ( – ). Several studies report that these networks function differently in neurological or psychiatric diseases ( – ). Since white matter microstructure is affected in migraine ( ) and also differs between disease subtypes ( ), a couple of questions arise. Does the functional activity of the white matter differs in disease comparing to the healthy population? Is there any difference between the various forms of migraine and if there it is, is it related to the microstructural alterations? \n\nResting state fMRI usually focus on the analysis of the whole frequency range of the time courses. However, it might be prudent to analyse different frequency ranges separately, since resting state networks were shown to be organize across several frequency bands ( ). Several publications report resting state network abnormalities throughout several frequency bands in neuropsychiatric diseases and investigate the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations ( – ). \n\nIn our study, we aimed to explore differences in white matter resting state functional activity between the two migraine subtypes (MWA and MWoA) and healthy individuals. Considering the previously reported abnormalities of white matter microstructure, we also investigated whether these microstructural alterations are related to functional measures of the white matter during rest in migraine. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe recruited 51 migraine patients in our study (18 MWA, 33 MwoA). The participants belonged to the same cohort, similar to our previous investigation ( ), all of them were enlisted from the Headache Outpatients Clinic of the Department of Neurology, University of Szeged. Apart from migraine, participants had no other neurologic or psychiatric disorders. All patients suffered from episodic migraine. None of the patients reported migraineous attack at in the preceeding week of the scanning. Each participant filled out a questionnaire about the prevalence and traits of the headache, medication and other diseases. None of the patient reported diabetes, or any other major cardiovascular diseases. Only one patient with aura was on interval therapy (iprazochrome). Seven of the 33 MWoA patients received interval treatment (1 topiramate, 1 amytriptilline, 5 iprazochrome). \n\nAs control group, we recruited 32 healthy volunteers, age and sex matched to the patients. Demographic data is included in  . \n  \nDemographic data of the participants. \n  \nThe local ethics committee of the University of Szeged approved the study (authority No.: 87/2009). All participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Image Acquisition \n  \nMR imaging was performed on a 1.5 T GE Signa Excite HDxt MRI scanner. For every participant, we obtained high-resolution T1 weighted images (3D IR-FSPGR: TR/TE/TI: 10.3/4.2/450 ms, flip angle: 15°, ASSET: 2, FOV: 25 25 cm, matrix: 256 256, slice thickness: 1 mm,), a resting state fMRI protocol with echo-planar imaging technique (TE: 40 ms, TR: 3,000 ms, matrix: 64 64 cm, FOV: 30 30 cm, slice thickness: 6 mm, flip angle: 90°, NEX: 1, ASSET: 2,0 Ph, Phases per Loc: 128, volumes: 200) and 60 directions diffusion-weighted images with 6 non-diffusion-weighted reference volume [TE: 93.8 ms; TR: 16.000 ms; matrix: 96 * 96; FOV: 23 * 23 cm; flip angle: 90°; in-plane resolution: 2.4 * 2.4 mm; slice thickness: 2.4 mm; b: 1,000 s/mm ; number of excitations (NEX): 2; array spatial sensitivity encoding technique (ASSET) factor = 2]. Head motion was attenuated with foam pads. \n\n\n### Data Processing \n  \nWe performed data pre-processing and statistical analyses with FSL (FMRIB's Software Library) toolkits. The Fourier transformation and statistical correlation calculation was performed by Matlab. \n\n\n### Pre-processing \n  \nWe pre-processed resting state fMRI volumes using the FEAT toolbox, which included the removal of the first two non-steady-state volumes, removal of non-brain tissue via BET ( ), motion correction (MCFLIRT), high pass filtering (cut-off sigma 100 s) and spatial smoothing with 6 mm FWHM. Because the motion parameters could alternate the BOLD signal, absolute and relative displacements were compared between groups. There were no significant differences in head movement. None of the subject's absolute displacement was larger then 0.8 mm. \n\nAll pre-processed fMRI images were registered to their own T1 images and to a standard structural image (MNI152, 2 mm isovoxel) with linear and non-linear registration respectively. To reduce calculation burden, we resampled all fMRI images to 4 mm isovoxel resolution. The pre-processed, standard space registered images were masked with a standard space white matter mask, thresholded at 0.99 probability. \n\nWe corrected diffusion data for eddy currents and movement artifacts by 12 degrees of freedom affine linear registration to the first non-diffusion-weighted reference image. Diffusion tensors at each voxel were fitted by FSL's FDT algorithm. Non-brain parts were removed with the brain extraction tool. We calculated fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), diffusivity axial (AD) and perpendicular (RD) to the principal diffusion direction for the whole brain, and aligned all subjects' FA images into a common space, using linear and non-linear registration. To match the resolution of functional volumes, we resampled the images to 4 mm isovoxel resolution. \n\n\n### Extraction of White Matter Resting State Networks \n  \nWe identified group level, spatially independent resting state fMRI networks using independent component analysis as implemented in FSL's MELODIC ( ). We used whole study population (patients and controls together) for networks' identification. Standard space white matter images entered the analysis flow after voxel wise demeaning and variance normalization. The individual participants' 4D fMRI data were concatenated into one dataset and decomposed into a set of matrices describing spatial and temporal domains, so that they showed maximally non-Gaussian distribution (fast ICA algorithm). We set the number of independent components to 30 and thresholded component spatial maps at   p   < 0.5. We selected components for further evaluation based on the following criteria: (I) no activation outside the brain or in the gray matter, (II) temporal fluctuation and power spectrum characteristics common to resting state gray matter networks ( ,  ), (III) a spatial pattern similar to the previously described white matter networks ( ). \n\n\n### Comparison of Networks and Power Spectrum Calculation \n  \nWe used a dual regression approach for comparison between resting state white matter networks by using components' spatial maps as spatial regressors against the original subject-wise fMRI data, thus obtaining subject-specific versions of network time courses. We then regressed these time courses against the original fMRI data, which yielded individual spatial layouts for each network. To assess group differences in white matter network activity, we employed a standard GLM approach, with the group membership coded in the model. We used a non-parametric permutation test (5,000 permutations) for statistical inference, assessing cluster significance with the threshold-free cluster enhancement technique ( ), and correcting for multiple comparisons via family wise error (FWE) correction ( ). \n\nTo decompose network activity in the frequency domain, the time courses created in the first step underwent a Fast Fourier transform, generating a power spectrum for all individuals, for each network. We compared power spectra between groups by a two-sample   t  -test. \n\n\n### Relationship Between Resting State Fluctuation and Diffusion Parameters \n  \nVoxel-wise correlation was calculated between the diffusion parameters and the group difference functional activity of the white matter. The analysis was restricted to the voxels showing significant group difference of functional activity at a threshold of   p   < 0.05. We used a non-parametric permutation test (5,000 permutations) for statistical inference, assessing cluster significance with the threshold-free cluster enhancement technique ( ), and correcting for multiple comparisons via family wise error (FWE) correction ( ). \n\n\n### Correlation Between MRI Parameters and Clinical Data \n  \nCorrelation was calculated between the diffusion parameters, functional activity of the white matter and clinical parameters. As dependent variable visual analog pain score (VAS), disease duration and attack frequency were used. MWA and MWoA groups were treated separately in our analysis. We used non-parametric permutation test for analysis and correcting for multiple comparisons via FWE. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographical Data \n  \nAge and gender showed no significant differences between the three groups. The disease duration did not differ between the two migraine subgroups. MwoA patients showed significantly higher VAS of headache (  p   < 0.01) and attack frequency (  p   < 0.03) compared to MWA group. \n\n\n### White Matter Resting State Functional Networks \n  \nEight white matter networks were identified, according to our inclusion criteria and publication revealed previously ( ). The networks' spatial distribution are shown in the  . Three white matter networks showed significant difference between patients and controls: \n  \nIC2 included the genu (rostrum) of the corpus callosum, fiber bundles extending bilaterally into the frontal poles. \n  \nIC7 contained bundles in the body of the corpus callosum, fibers extending bilaterally into the frontal and parietal lobes. \n  \nIC17 contained the bilateral occipital white matter. \n  \n\n### Different Expression of White Matter Functional Networks \n  \n#### MWA Compared to MWoA \n  \nThe dual regression analysis identified higher expression in MWA compared to MWoA in all three networks. \n\nFor the network representing the genu of the corpus callosum (IC2), we found differences between MWA and MWoA in the right hemisphere and also in midline ( ). \n  \nThree white matter functional networks (IC2,   A  ; IC7,   B   and IC17,   C  ) had different expression in MWA and MWoA. Higher expression and amplitude was found in the case of MWA. The white matter functional networks are depicted in red-to-yellow thresholded to 0.5 probability. The group differences between MWA and MWoA is shown in blue-to-light blue thresholded at   p   < 0.05. The colorbar represents   p  -values. The group average Fourier spectrum presented next to the spatial maps. The red line represents MWA, the black MWoA. Green columns showed frequency values that different significantly between the two groups (  p   < 0.05). \n  \nFor the network including the white matter fibers crossing in the body of the corpus callosum (IC7) differences appeared in the left frontal anterior area and right parietal white matter ( ). \n\nFor the network including the bilateral occipital bundles (IC17) differences were found next to the medial side of the occipital gray matter ( ). \n\nAll areas with connectivity differences showed increased amplitude of fluctuation in MWA compared to MWoA. \n\n\n#### MWA Compared to Healthy Volunteers \n  \nIC2 showed changes in the bilateral frontal white matter ( ). IC17 revealed changes in the right occipital pathways ( ). In the area of significance, the amplitude of fluctuation was higher in MWA patients compared to healthy volunteers. \n  \nThe two white matter functional networks showing differences between MWA and healthy volunteers (IC2,   A   and IC17,   B  ). The white matter functional networks are depicted in red-to-yellow and thresholded to 0.5 probability. The group differences are shown in blue-to-light blue thresholded at   p   < 0.05. The colorbar represents   p  -values. The group average Fourier spectrum presented next to the spatial maps. The red line represents MWA, the black controls. Green columns showed frequency values that different significantly between the two groups (  p   < 0.05). \n  \n\n#### MWoA Compared to Healthy Volunteers \n  \nThere were no significant differences between healthy volunteers and MWoA patients in any of the white matter resting state networks. \n\n\n\n### Connection Between Resting State Fluctuation and Underlying Microstructure \n  \nThe resting state fMRI fluctuation of the network including the genu of the corpus callosum (IC2) was correlated with measures of the underlying microstructure. We found positive correlation with FA (  r   = 0.61,   p   < 0.05) and negative correlation with RD (  r   = −0.55;   p   < 0.05) in MWA patients ( ). \n  \nPositive correlation was found between fractional anisotropy and frontal white matter activity fluctuations   (A)   (  p   < 0.05, corrected for multiple correlations) in MWA patients. Negative correlation was found between radial diffusivity and frontal white matter activity in the same area   (B)   (  p   < 0.05). The x axis represents the diffusion values of FA   (A)   and RD   (B)  . The y axis shows the z-scores under the specified area. \n  \nNo other functional network activity was associated with diffusion parameters. \n\n\n### Correlation Between MRI Parameters and Clinical Data \n  \nNone of the resting state network, neither the diffusion parameters showed correlation with clinical parameters of the patients. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur investigation showed that white matter functional networks similar to the gray matter resting state functional networks show alterations in migraine with aura. Three white matter networks showed stronger expression, primarily higher amplitude of activity fluctuation in MWA. Furthermore, alterations of resting state functional fluctuation showed a strong association with parameters of the underlying white matter microstructure, a feature that has not been reported before. \n\nConventional fMRI measures the BOLD signal in the gray matter. However, several studies found task dependent activation in the white matter as well ( ,  ). A combined DTI and fMRI study found functional activation in a white matter tract connected to the cortex ( ). Moreover, similar to the gray matter, the effect of anesthesia and hypercapnia is detectable in the BOLD response of the white matter ( ,  ). There are, however, significant differences that separate WM activation from GM activation: for example, the power spectrum of the WM response is reduced ( ), and the hemodynamic response function (HRF) also differs from that in the gray matter, as the WM response delayed and has a lower amplitude ( ,  ). Furthermore, the WM HRF was more variable in separate tracts under functional loading ( ). Although these previous studies used specialized fMRI sequences, it is widely accepted that the measured fMRI activation strongly depends on the HRF model. The different response may be attributed to lower vascular density or diameter ( ,  ), or the lack of post synaptic potentiation in the white matter ( ). Furthermore, the gray matter's relatively greater vascular volume, higher cerebral blood flow, metabolism and connected hemodynamic response ( ,  ) results in a higher BOLD signal ( ) compared to that of the WM. \n\nIt was also presented that BOLD activity fluctuation can be measured in the WM too. Resting state fMRI fluctuation in the WM showed a temporal profile similar to the GM, with a comparable power spectrum. There is a detectable connection between GM and WM tract activation in rest ( ,  ,  ). Symmetrical white matter resting state networks can be identified, which show strong overlap with anatomical white matter tracts ( ). \n\nPrevious electrophysiological and MRI studies found functional alterations in MWA patients compared to MWoA and healthy volunteers. Visual evoked potential studies registered increased response in MWA patients ( ,  ). A TMS meta-analysis also found lower phosphene threshold in MWA, but not in MWoA ( ). The background of such altered excitability might be the alteration of local neurotransmitter milieu. Lower GABA level an indicator of reduced inhibition ( ), and higher glutamate/glutamine ratio was found in the MWA ( ). \n\nAs an indirect fMRI evidence of the altered excitability we found increased amplitude of resting BOLD fluctuation in large scale GM networks in MWA compared to MWoA ( ,  ). Our analysis showed that this dysfunctions extends into the white matter, with increased connectivity and higher amplitude of BOLD fluctuation. In the background of the white matter functional alterations can stand from the connected axonal function or axonal loading transport changes, which are consequences of altered gray matter activity. The increased axonal usage generates higher energy demand that may affect the callosal much more ( ). Higher activity in the occipital fibers might stem from the altered occipital neuronal activity connected to CSD phenomenon (our MWA group of patients reported mostly visual aura). \n\nIn our earlier investigations we found white matter microstructural differences in migraine ( ), mostly pronounced in MWA ( ). Most importantly in the current study we found connection between microstructural and functional alterations. White matter resting state activity correlated strongly with FA and RD values of the corresponding white matter pathway, which are often interpreted as measures of myelin content and microstructural integrity ( ). A recent review discusses a similar connection between fractional anisotropy and fMRI fluctuation ( ), however, information about structure-function relationship in the white matter is scarce. A possible explanation for this connection is that increased myelin concentration requires an increased energy supply, which could translate to chronic BOLD fluctuation changes. \n\nThe signs of altered cortical excitability perceived not just in the gray, but also in the white matter in MWA. Being either the cause of or consequence, structural alterations can be found in migraine too, that is more pronounced in MWA. These results indicate fundamental differences in the two subtypes of the disease that needs attention in clinical care and also during development of therapeutic interventions. \n\nOf course, out investigation is not without limitations. While the unequal size of the groups and the relatively small sample size are partially accounted for by the use of non-parametric statistical approaches these factors could potentially limit the generalisability of our findings. While theoretically one should account for multiple comparisons when investigating multiple ICs or functional networks, correction for multiple comparisons are potentially over-conservative and not frequently used in the literature. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Szeged (authority No.: 87/2009).

We hypothesized reduced volume of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), reduced structural connectivity of the segment of the supero-lateral medial forebrain bundle connecting the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) with the NAcc (OFC-NAcc), and reduced resting-state OFC-NAcc functional connectivity (FC). Furthermore, we hypothesized that craving is related to an increase of OFC-NAcc FC. Thirty-nine recently abstinent patients with AUD and 18 healthy controls (HC) underwent structural (T1w-MP2RAGE, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)) and functional (resting-state fMRI) MRI-scans. Gray matter volume of the NAcc, white matter microstructure (fractional anisotropy (FA)) and macrostructure (tract length) of the OFC-NAcc connection and OFC-NAcc FC were compared between AUD and HC using a mixed model MANCOVA controlling for age and gender. Craving was assessed using the thoughts subscale of the obsessive-compulsive drinking scale (OCDS) scale and was correlated with OFC-NAcc FC. There was a significant main effect of group. Results were driven by a volume reduction of bilateral NAcc, reduced FA in the left hemisphere, and reduced tract length of bilateral OFC-NAcc connections in AUD patients. OFC-NAcc FC did not differ between groups. Craving was associated with increased bilateral OFC-NAcc FC. In conclusion, reduced volume of the NAcc and reduced FA and tract length of the OFC-NAcc network suggest structural alterations of the reward network in AUD. Increased OFC-NAcc FC is associated with craving in AUD, and may contribute to situational alcohol-seeking behavior in AUD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSevere alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing disorder associated with harmful somatic, psychological, and social consequences . Core features of AUD are craving, the recurring desire and urge for alcohol consumption and the impaired ability to control alcohol-seeking behavior despite its negative consequences . According to the World Health Organization (WHO) more than 3 million deaths worldwide are caused by harmful use of alcohol each year . AUD is characterized by very high rates of post-residential treatment relapse (80–92%) , especially in the first 3 months after residential treatment . Thus, there is a need for more effective treatment regimens. A profound knowledge on the neurobiology of addiction, particularly regarding craving and inhibition of alcohol seeking behavior, may contribute to improving novel treatment approaches such as alcohol-specific inhibition training, neurofeedback, or brain stimulation therapies . This, in turn may set the path for a more personalized AUD treatment. \n\nOn a neurobiological level the reward system plays an essential role for the pathophysiology of addiction , in particular regarding the hedonic experience of consuming alcohol (e.g., liking) and the urge for alcohol consumption (e.g., wanting) . Central relay stations of the reward system are the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a core region for the selection of motivationally relevant events . In healthy participants including heavy social drinkers, liking is moderately associated with wanting, although it has been suggested that wanting and liking are dividable and independent processes . During the progression of addiction there is a decrease of liking and an increase of wanting, the latter being related to the experience of craving and to compulsive alcohol use . Wanting relies on dopaminergic pathways projecting from the VTA to the NAcc and to the OFC . These dopaminergic projections initiate neuroplastic changes in their target regions (e.g., the OFC), which encode for learned associations with pleasurable events (e.g., alcohol consumption) . Such associations may form the basis for situational alcohol-seeking behavior in AUD. Consequently, models of addiction refer to the OFC-NAcc connection as the final common pathway for initiating alcohol-seeking behavior in AUD . \n\nGray matter volume reductions of core regions of the reward system in AUD have been reported repeatedly (e.g., NAcc, OFC ). This may be due to a particularly pronounced vulnerability of regions of the reward system to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol . Structurally, those regions of the reward system are connected through white matter pathways forming a complex network . The most commonly applied measure for the assessment of white matter microstructure is the fractional anisotropy (FA), reflecting the coherence of diffusion of water molecules . A series of voxel-by-voxel comparison-based whole brain studies found FA reductions in AUD . Localizations of findings are widespread (e.g., in the corpus callosum, internal and external capsule, or in the fornix) and many findings lack associations with behavioral measures relevant to addiction. Thus, those alterations may rather be the result of alcohol toxicity than a neurobiological correlate of addiction pathophysiology. This assumption is also supported by observations that global white matter microstructure alterations in AUD are reversible, if abstinence is maintained and recur after relapse . \n\nThe fiber architecture of the reward system , believed to underlie the pathophysiology of addiction , is complex because of multiple crossing and merging fibers . In such regions of crossing fibers, tract-specific conclusions require the use of tractography, allowing for a non-invasive in vivo reconstruction of neuronal pathways based on diffusion weighted MRI . However, tractography studies of the reward system in AUD are scarce . One previous study used tractography to investigate the supero-lateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle (slMFB) in AUD . The slMFB consists of mono- and polysynaptic projection pathways of the VTA (vtaPP ,) connecting the VTA with the NAcc and with prefrontal brain regions including the OFC . Based on lesion studies in humans and on tract-tracing studies, such projection pathways likely consist of bidirectional corticopetal and corticofugal projection pathways into and out of the VTA . In our study, we investigate the slMFB segment anterior of the NAcc, which predominantly connects to the OFC . In the following, we refer to this segment of the slMFB as the OFC-NAcc connection. In addition to FA, a measure of white matter microstructure , we use the tract length as a measure of white matter macrostructure, which may be related to white matter atrophy  complementing our structural white matter analyses. \n\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) allows for the measurement of fluctuations in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals that are associated with specific brain functions. This complements structural analyses of gray matter volume and white matter microstructure. In AUD, there are decreased BOLD-levels of core regions of the reward system in the absence of alcoholic stimuli . Extending classical BOLD analyses, resting-state functional connectivity (FC) analyses provide crucial information on connectivity strengths between spatially segregated brain regions, hereby yielding functional networks . Decreased resting-state FC between core regions of the reward system including the NAcc and the OFC  may be associated with a lack of response to natural rewarding stimuli and result in a psychological state characterized by feelings of anxiety, reduced energy, and restlessness . \n\nConsistent with the assumption that patients with severe AUD drink alcohol to diminish aversive affects , there is an enhanced cue reactivity in AUD in response to alcoholic cues in regions of the reward system . The OFC and the NAcc seem to be key to the neurobiology of AUD given that both regions have been related to craving in response to alcoholic cues . In this study, we extend these previous fMRI analyses linking craving at rest to resting-state OFC-NAcc connectivity, hereby providing information on the neurobiology of craving on a functional network level. \n\nIt was the aim of this first three-fold multimodal MRI-study using gray matter volumetry, tractography, and FC analyses to investigate structural and functional aspects of the OFC-NAcc network, and its association with craving in a group of recently abstinent patients with severe AUD compared to healthy controls. Our first hypothesis was decreased bilateral volume of the NAcc in AUD . Second, we hypothesized decreased FA and a reduced tract length of the OFC-NAcc connection in AUD . Third, we hypothesized decreased OFC-NAcc resting-state FC in AUD  and fourth, we hypothesized that increased resting-state OFC-NAcc FC is associated with craving in AUD . \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study participants \n  \nAll AUD-patients were participating in a clinical trial investigating the effects of an alcohol-inhibition training on relapse . A sub-sample of those AUD-patients was included in a longitudinal fMRI-study investigating the functional correlates of this training. The diffusion-weighted MRI-protocol is an extension of the latter study and was added at a later stage. In our study, only baseline MRI-scans and assessments that were acquired before the intervention started were considered. To avoid influences of age-related atrophy on brain structure inclusion criterion for all participants was age between 18–59 years of age. Thirty-nine right-handed detoxified patients with severe AUD attending a 12-week abstinence-oriented residential treatment program for AUD in a specialized treatment center in Switzerland (Clinic Suedhang) were recruited. All patients met criteria for AUD as clinically assessed in accordance with the DSM-5, and had been abstinent for at least 4 weeks prior to study participation. Eighteen right-handed healthy controls (HC) with non-problematic drinking behavior (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT ) score < 8; Alcohol Use Disorder Scale (AUD-S  score < 2)), and low scores regarding psychopathology (Brief Symptom Check List (BSCL , GSI  ≤ 63) were recruited. Current treatment for a psychiatric diagnosis and/or psychopharmacological medication, treatment for any substance use disorder in the past, problematic substance use (except nicotine; Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) score ≤ 8 per substance , e.g., cannabis) and neurocognitive problems were exclusion criteria. \n\nThis study aimed to investigate the neurobiology of subjective craving at rest (as assessed with resting-state fMRI). Craving was assessed immediately before the MRI-scan and measured with the German version of the obsessive compulsive drinking scale (OCDS) . The OCDS consists of 14 items assessing both obsessive thoughts about alcohol use and compulsive drinking behavior. Given that resting-state fMRI is measured in the absence of behavior by definition, we chose the obsessive thoughts of alcohol subscale as our outcome measure for craving. Furthermore, we used the Comprehensive Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire (CAEQ), a self-report measure with 41 items, designed to assess an individual’s positive and negative alcohol outcome expectancies, which are related to the level of alcohol use and relapse following treatment for alcohol use disorders . In addition, the brief symptom checklist (global severity index, GSI) was used for the assessment of subjective impairments due to somatic and mental problems . Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck depression inventory (BDI) . All participants provided written informed consent and were reimbursed for participation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (KEK-number: 2016-00988) and registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02968537) and the Swiss National Clinical Trials Portal (SNCTP000002043). \n\n\n### MRI-data acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired at the University Hospital of Bern, with a 3 Tesla Siemens Magnetom Prisma scanner and with a 64-channel head/neck coil. For high-resolution T1-weighted structural images, we used a bias-field corrected MP2RAGE sequence for improved segmentation (256 Slices, field of view (FOV) = 256 × 256, 256 × 256 matrix, 1 mm  isotropic resolution, repletion time (TR) = 5000 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.98 ms, inversion time   T  1 = 700 ms and   T  2 = 2500 ms). The MP2RAGE sequence generated three image volumes, two gradient echo images (INV1 and INV2) and a T1 weighted image (UNI). Diffusion weighted images (DWI) were acquired using a spin-echo echo-planar sequence with 64 non-collinear directions and   b  -value = 1000 s/mm  (60 Slices, FOV = 269 × 269, 128 × 128 matrix, 2.2 mm  isotropic resolution, TR = 6200 ms, TE = 69 ms). A resting-state fMRI scan (condition: eyes closed) was acquired using whole brain echo planar imaging (EPI) (300 volumes with 60 slices per volume, FOV = 230 × 230, 104 × 104 matrix, 2.2 mm  isotropic resolution, TR = 1300 ms, TE = 37 ms). \n\n\n### Data analyses \n  \n#### Structural MRI pre-processing \n  \nWe used   FSL-FIRST  , a model-based segmentation and registration tool for subcortical structures implemented in   FSL 5.0   ( ), for segmentation of bilateral NAcc . Due to noisy background of the MP2RAGE UNI image, we used the INV2 image for brain extraction and binary mask generation with   FSL-BET   using robust brain center estimation (-R option). Then, we applied the binary mask to the UNI image using   FSLMATHS   and run   FSL-FIRST   for segmentation of the bilateral NAcc using the brain extracted UNI image as input and standard settings. The segmentation model uses a Bayesian appearance model and measures the probabilistic relationships between shape and GM intensity. Subcortical volumes (in mm ) of the bilateral NAcc were finally determined using   FSL-STATS   with the   all_fast_firstseg   files as input and a threshold of 25.5–26.5 for the left NAcc and 57.5–58.5 for the right NAcc (Fig.  ).    Multimodal imaging analyses.  \n A   Example volumetry of bilateral NAcc in native space.   B   Example of individual native space OFC-NAcc connections (color coded) and the remaining proximal segment (in gray).   C   OFC (BA 10 and 11) and NAcc masks in MNI space for computation of bilateral OFC-NAcc FC. \n  \n\n\n#### Diffusion-weighted MRI data pre-processing \n  \nDiffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) data were analyzed using   ExploreDTI 4.8.6  . Data were pre-processed as described in previous publications . In short, a subjection motion and distortion correction and an EPI-correction was performed . Whole-brain tractography was executed fitting a single diffusion tensor model to the DW-MRI data . Angle threshold of >45° and FA <0.2 were used as termination criteria. Diffusion properties (e.g., FA) were sampled along the tracts. \n\n\n#### Tract reconstruction \n  \nWe aimed at reconstructing the OFC-NAcc segment of the slMFB, because this segment is part of a polysynaptic network connecting OFC, NAcc and VTA , core regions for the pathophysiology of craving in AUD . First, the entire slMFB was reconstructed as described in previous publications . The following seed gates were used separately for both hemispheres: The VTA was identified on a horizontal section. A circular seed was drawn anterior of the red nucleus, medial of the substantia nigra and posterior to the mammillary bodies. A second seed region was drawn on a coronal section at the height of the NAcc surrounding the anterior limb of the internal capsule. Seed regions were chosen in line with previous studies (e.g., ). Given that we were specifically interested in the OFC-NAcc segment of the MFB, we used the splitter tool implemented in   ExploreDTI 4.8.6   to isolate the slMFB segment anterior of the NAcc connecting to (predominantly orbitofrontal) prefrontal brain regions (see Fig.  ). Mean-FA and tract length were calculated for each tract . \n\n\n#### Functional MRI pre-processing \n  \nWe analysed FC using a seed-driven approach of the   CONN 19c   toolbox . We used standard pipeline and parameters. Pre-processing steps included realignment and field map correction of EPI volumes, co-registration to structural volumes (MP2RAGE) and segmentation/normalization of structural volumes and smoothing of normalized EPI volumes. We applied a band-pass filtering (0.008–0.09 Hz) to remove physiological signals and regressed nuisance variables including 12 realignment parameters and each five time series within segmented white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, derived by principal component analysis. Afterwards, we defined the left and right NAcc as seed region and computed their regional FC over the whole brain. Using   MATLAB  , we extracted mean values of FC-maps within the left and right OFC using predefined masks representing Brodmann area 10 and 11 of the   WFUPickatlas 3.0   (see Fig.  ). \n\n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nBased previous studies investigating functional  and structural alterations  of the reward system in AUD, we expected to get a mean effect size of   f   = 0.15 for the between factor (AUD vs. HC) having a total sample size of 57 participants and performing a mixed-model MANCOVA with one between factor, one within factor, four dependent variables and controlling for the two covariates age and gender. A posthoc analysis to calculate the power achieved, given alpha = 0.05, sample size = 57, number of groups = 2, number of dependent variables = 4, and number of covariates = 3, yielded a power (1-beta) of 0.93 using the program G*Power . \n\nStatistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS 26.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Demographics between AUD und HC were compared using   t  -tests for continuous variables or   χ   tests for dichotomous variables. A mixed-model MANCOVA controlling for age and gender with the between-factor group (HC vs. AUD), the within-factor hemisphere (left, right) and four dependent variables comprising the four modalities (gray matter volume of NAcc, FA (OFC-NAcc), tract length (OFC-NAcc) and FC (OFC-NAcc)) was used. Significant main effects were followed up with post-hoc tests. In case of a significant group × hemisphere interaction, post-hoc ANCOVAs controlling for age and gender were calculated separately for each hemisphere and modality. All tests were two-tailed and a probability of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Effect sizes were reported as   η  . Additional exploratory correlations for the AUD group were calculated between the four imaging modalities and the total OCDS-scale and the compulsive drinking subscale (see Supplementary material Tables   and  ). To provide more detailed anatomical information on the localization of FC, two separate seed-based FC analyses were performed using the NAcc as a seed. First, NAcc-FC to the whole brain and second to the OFC mask. Analyses were performed separately for each hemisphere using the CONN toolbox . Voxel-wise comparisons in FC between AUD and HC groups were performed with a voxel-level threshold of   p   < 0.001 and with a family wise error (FWE) cluster-level correction of   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study population \n  \nThe groups did not differ regarding age or gender. Results indicate that our AUD group mainly consists of patients with severe AUD (see Table   for demographics and clinical characteristics).   \nSociodemographic and clinical characteristics. \n  \nMeans and standard deviations are displayed. Group differences are displayed by *  p   < 0.05, **  p   < 0.01, and ***  p   < 0.001. \n\n AUDIT   alcohol use disorders identification test,   AUD   alcohol use disorder scale,   OCDS   obsessive compulsive drinking scale,   CAEG   comprehensive alcohol expectancy questionnaire,   BDI   Beck depression inventory, Brief symptom check list. \n  \n\n\n### Group comparisons \n  \nThe mixed model MANCOVA revealed a significant main effect of group showing a large effect size (  F  (4, 50) = 2.612,   p   = 0.046,   η   = 0.173). Posthoc tests demonstrated a significant group main effect for NAcc volume (AUD patients < controls;   F  (1, 53) = 5.986,   p   = 0.018,   η   = 0.101, hemisphere × group interaction (  F  (1, 53) =0.458,   p   = 0.502,   η   = 0.009). Further posthoc tests revealed a significant hemisphere × group interaction for FA (  F  (1, 53) = 4.629,   p   = 0.036,   η   = 0.080). Therefore, separate ANCOVAs with the independent variable group and the dependent variable FA controlling for age and gender were calculated for each hemisphere. FA of the OFC-NAcc connection was reduced in AUD in the left (  F  (1, 53) = 5.224,   p   = 0.026,   η   = 0.090), but not in the right (  F  (1, 53) = 0.803,   p   = 0.374,   η   = 0.015) hemisphere. Finally, there was a significant main effect for OFC-NAcc tract length (AUD patients < controls;   F  (1, 53) = 4.609,   p   = 0.036,   η   = 0.080, hemisphere × group interaction (  F  (1, 53) = 0.015,   p   = 0.902,   η   < 0.001), but not for resting state OFC-NAcc FC (  F  (1, 53) = 0.152,   p   = 0.698,   η   = 0.003, hemisphere × group interaction (  F  (1, 53) = 0.198,   p   = 0.659,   η   = 0.004) (see Fig.  ). For both hemispheres, we found no significant group differences between AUD and HC in seed-based FC from the NAcc to the whole brain and to the OFC mask. See supplementary Fig.   for visualization of whole-brain FC within group and hemisphere.    Boxplots for AUD and HC are displayed for the respective imaging modalities.  \nThere was a significant group main effect for NAcc volume (bilateral), for FA of the left OFC-NAcc segment and for tract length (bilateral). OFC-NAcc FC did not differ between groups. \n  \n\n\n### Correlations with craving and OFC-NAcc FC \n  \nIn the AUD group craving was significantly correlated with OFC-NAcc FC for both the left (  r   = 0.477,   p   = 0.002) and the right (  r   = 0.390,   p   = 0.014) hemisphere, indicating higher FC with increased craving (see Fig.  ).   \nCorrelations of OFC-NAcc FC with craving in AUD. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis is the first study that combined gray matter volume analyses of the NAcc, tractography of the OFC-NAcc segment of the slMFB and OFC-NAcc FC to investigate structural and functional alterations in AUD and its association with craving. Our results point to structural alterations of the OFC-NAcc network in recently abstinent patients suffering from severe AUD. We found reduced gray matter volume of the NAcc, and impaired structural connectivity in terms of reduced white matter microstructure (FA) of the left and macrostructure (tract length) of bilateral OFC-NAcc connections. There were no group differences in resting-state OFC-NAcc FC. Bilateral OFC-NAcc resting-state FC positively correlated with craving, thus underpinning this network’s key role for individual variations in the pathophysiology of AUD. \n\nOne anatomical concept regarding the OFC-NAcc pathway is that this final common pathway activates the NAcc , which in turn projects to the pallidum initiating alcohol-seeking behavior via thalamo-cortical pathways . An alternative explanation is that OFC-NAcc projections of the slMFB activate corticofugal glutamatergic projections from the NAcc to the VTA (as visualized by the gray shaded segment of the slMFB (Fig.  )). Dopaminergic efferents from the VTA may project to the PFC via the infero-medial MFB (the classic anatomical MFB description in rodents) , hereby mediating craving. Both theories are consistent with results of exploratory correlations suggesting that higher FA of the left OFC-NAcc is associated with increased craving in AUD (  r   = 0.321,   p   = 0.046, see supplementary material, Table  ). Thus, white matter microstructure of the OFC-NAcc pathway may indeed be associated with craving, indicating a core role of this pathway for the pathophysiology of addiction. \n\nThis assumption is indirectly supported by our resting-state fMRI-results. We identified a positive correlation between left and right resting-state OFC-NAcc FC and craving. Consequently, the OFC-NAcc network may play an important role for craving, even at rest and in the absence of alcoholic stimuli. The intrusiveness of craving allows for an analogy with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Interestingly, pathophysiology of OCD has also been related to increased structural connectivity between the OFC and the NAcc . Our finding thus complements event-related fMRI studies demonstrating increased BOLD activations of the NAcc, and the OFC in response to alcoholic cues . A previous event-related FC study using alcoholic cues investigated craving in a clinically heterogeneous patient group ranging from social drinkers to severe AUD . Both positive (medial OFC-insula) and negative (lateral OFC-NAcc) correlations between FC during a cue reactivity task and craving were identified . Differences in study design (resting-state vs. cue reactivity task) and clinical differences could account for the inconsistencies. Furthermore, craving may either be driven by reward (e.g., in social drinkers ) or by avoidance of negative affect (e.g., in severe AUD ). Thus, it is difficult to compare the neurobiology of craving between clinically diverse AUD-groups. \n\nIn line with our hypothesis, we found reduced volume of bilateral NAcc in AUD, thus replicating previous studies (e.g., ). Furthermore, reduced FA of the left and reduced tract length of bilateral OFC-NAcc connections were found in AUD. Exploratory analysis showed an association (  r   = 0.387,   p   = 0.015, see Supplementary material Table  ) between the left NAcc volume and FA of the left OFC-NAcc segment. Thus, one may speculate whether alcohol-induced gray matter atrophy of the NAcc leads to reduced white matter microstructure in AUD. Given that the directionality (in terms of afferents or efferents) of fiber tracts cannot be determined based on tractography, it may also be possible that white matter microstructure alterations stem from cortical atrophy in the OFC, a common and well replicated finding in AUD . Another explanation is that the toxic effects of alcohol damage both gray and white matter of the OFC-NAcc network  or that white matter damage of the OFC-NAcc connection leads to retrograde atrophy of NAcc gray matter . In either case, three complementary structural measures (FA and tract length of the OFC-NAcc connection and NAcc-volume) suggest atrophy of the OFC-NAcc network in AUD, most likely a consequence of alcohol-induced neurotoxicity . \n\nContrary to our hypothesis, we did not find any group differences in resting-state OFC-NAcc FC between AUD and healthy controls. Previous studies demonstrated lower resting-state FC of the reward system in abstinent AUD patients than in HC , a finding that is more pronounced in long-term than in short term AUD abstinence . Given that our AUD group mainly consists of short-term abstinent patients this may have contributed to the absence of group differences regarding resting-state OFC-NAcc FC. However, previous findings are not entirely consistent. One longitudinal study demonstrated that contrary to the initial hypothesis, relapsers had lower FC between the PFC and the NAcc than abstainers . Overall, divergent findings may stem from comparing results of anatomically adjacent but functionally complementary brain regions (e.g., different hotspots for wanting and liking within the NAcc shell or functional differences regarding the medial and the lateral OFC . Furthermore, it is crucial to note that FC analyses are influenced by a series of factors such as AUD severity and duration, the presence of comorbid depressive symptoms, the duration of abstinence or the contextual situation regarding alcohol exposure, which may as well partially explain heterogeneous findings . \n\nFinally, this study has some limitations: First, our correlational study does not allow for conclusions regarding causalities or directionalities. Second, we use tractography to reconstruct individual projection pathways. However, it is impossible to determine the anatomical directionality of projection pathways. Furthermore, it is impossible to make statements on direct and indirect connections and on the type of neurotransmitters (e.g., dopaminergic or glutamatergic). Third, although AUD patients and healthy controls are well matched and analysis are controlled for age and gender, there remain differences (e.g., depressive symptoms, years of education). Given that education is strongly correlated with the group variable using education as covariate can reduce validity or sensitivity and is not advised . Thus, we cannot statistically rule out that education may have had an influence on neurophysiological results. Fourth, our sample of AUD patients comprises almost exclusively patients with severe AUD. While this is a positive aspect allowing for a precise definition of the sample under investigation, it limits generalizability to patients with mild or moderate AUD. \n\nTo conclude, our findings in recently abstinent patients with severe AUD demonstrate that AUD is associated with gray and white matter structural alterations of the OFC-NAcc network, putatively a neurotoxic effect of alcohol. Functionally, this network plays a core role for craving as suggested by the identified correlation between craving and resting-state OFC-NAcc FC, which may also affect white matter microstructure of the corresponding OFC-NAcc connection pathway. Future studies should assess if those changes reverse with abstinence in the long term . Furthermore, it is of clinical interest to assess the predictive value of such MRI-assessments for novel treatment approaches, such as neurofeedback, alcohol-inhibition training, or brain stimulation therapies . \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"f0fb17605d3744df4969fa7d10accdac"},

The RewP is thought to reflect reward reactivity in the mesocorticolimbic system; however, it is not clear how the RewP is related to the functional connectivity of reward‐related brain regions. The current study examined associations between the RewP (Win and Loss residuals) and resting‐state fMRI (rs‐fMRI), among adults with internalizing psychopathology (IP) and healthy controls (HC). All participants (  N   = 102) completed a validated monetary reward task during electroencephalogram and rs‐fMRI. Regression analyses were conducted with (1) RewP‐Win residual amplitude and striatal seeds (caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens) and (2) RewP‐Loss residual amplitude and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) seeds. Overall, individuals with greater RewP‐Win residual amplitude demonstrated increased rs‐fMRI connectivity between striatal regions and the medial prefrontal cortex, as well as the parahippocampal gyrus, but decreased connectivity between striatal regions and regions involved in cognitive control and sensorimotor processing. Greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to greater connectivity between the ACC and regions involved in reward/loss processing and motor control, but decreased connectivity between the ACC and regions involved in cognitive control. Relationships between the RewP and rs‐fMRI were generally consistent across IP and HC. However, a few patterns were unique to IP. Results indicate the RewP is associated with resting‐state functional connectivity of reward‐ and loss‐related brain regions, suggesting connectivity of the mesocorticolimbic system may be an important individual difference factor in dimensions of attainment of reward and loss. \n  \nOur results provide the first preliminary evidence that the RewP, a neurophysiological marker of initial response to reward and loss, is associated with functional connectivity of the mesocorticolimbic system during resting‐state fMRI among individuals with and without internalizing psychopathologies. Mesocorticolimbic connectivity may be an important individual difference factor in determining how individuals respond to the attainment of reward and loss. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nReward dysfunction is implicated across the spectrum of anxiety and depression disorders (e.g., Craske et al.,  ). To better understand reward‐related processes, RDoC has identified several biologically based reward constructs within the Positive Valence System, including initial responsiveness to reward attainment. One measure that is frequently used to examine initial reward responsiveness at the neurophysiological level is the reward positivity (RewP). The RewP is an event‐related potential (ERP) component maximal at frontocentral electrode sites occurring approximately 250–350 ms following the receipt of a reward. The RewP is thought to reflect the processing of positive feedback (e.g., monetary reward) versus breaking even or losing (see Proudfit,  ). Accumulating evidence suggests that the RewP has excellent psychometric properties (Bress, Meyer, & Proudfit,  ) and is a valid measure of individual differences in reward processing. For example, higher RewP values have been correlated with positive emotionality in children (Kujawa et al.,  ) and self‐reported reward sensitivity in college students (Bress & Hajcak,  ). The RewP has been shown to be disrupted (e.g., blunted) in internalizing psychopathologies, especially in depression in clinical and non‐clinical samples (Bress et al.,  ; Bress, Meyer, & Hajcak,  ; Bress, Meyer, & Proudfit,  ; Burkhouse et al.,  ; Foti & Hajcak,  ; Nelson et al.,  ). The RewP has also been identified as a biological marker of depression risk among youth (for review, see Kujawa & Burkhouse,  ) and adults (for review, see Proudfit,  ). Few studies have examined the RewP in relation to anxiety, especially among clinical samples. Among studies examining the relationship between the RewP and anxiety, the findings are mixed, with one study showing an attenuated RewP is associated with greater trait anxiety among young adults (Gu et al.,  ), other studies finding that a larger RewP is associated with higher symptoms of social anxiety among children and undergraduate students (Kessel et al.,  ; Nelson & Jarcho,  ), and other studies finding no relationship between the RewP and anxiety symptoms among children, adolescents, or undergraduate students (Bress et al.,  ; Bress, Meyer, & Hajcak,  ; Foti & Hajcak,  ). In a clinical sample of adult participants with a variety of internalizing diagnoses, we found that an attenuated RewP was associated with greater affective distress/misery‐based symptoms, but not fear‐based anxiety symptoms (Burkhouse et al.,  ). Taken together, there is mixed evidence as to whether the RewP is associated with anxiety. Few studies have examined whether the RewP is disrupted among individuals with comorbid depression and anxiety, despite the fact that comorbidity of these disorders is extremely common (Kalin,  ). \n\nThe RewP was previously termed the feedback negativity (FN), as traditionally the RewP was analyzed as the difference in average reactivity to rewards versus losses, while the FN was the inverse: The difference in average reactivity to losses versus rewards (see Proudfit,  ). Recent psychometric studies suggest that reactivity to rewards and losses can be better analyzed using a regression‐based approach (Meyer et al.,  ). Specifically, this approach computes two sets of residuals reflecting (a) neural reactivity to reward independent of reactivity to loss (RewP‐Win residual), and (b) neural reactivity to loss independent of reactivity to reward (RewP‐Loss residual). This approach is better able to isolate neural activity related to a specific process of interest than the difference scores because the Win and Loss residuals obtained from this regression‐based approach are orthogonal. Importantly, the residual scores also have superior psychometric properties compared to traditional difference scores (Bress, Meyer, & Proudfit,  ; Ethridge & Weinberg,  ). \n\nSource localization studies suggest that the RewP (Win > Loss) is related to reward‐related brain activity. For example, one study found that the RewP may originate from the dorsal striatum (Foti et al.,  ), which includes the caudate and putamen. Follow‐up studies found the RewP was related to fMRI BOLD and EEG activation (via source localization) of brain regions implicated in rewards, such as the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens [NAcc]) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), during reward attainment among healthy individuals (Becker et al.,  ; Carlson et al.,  ; Foti et al.,  ; Gehring & Willoughby,  ). Together, these findings provide compelling evidence that the RewP may be generated by neural activity in reward‐related regions, especially the striatum. On the other hand, source localization studies suggest that the FN (Loss > Win) may originate from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Dehaene et al.,  ; Miltner et al.,  ), a region involved in error processing and cognitive control. Notably, these previous source localization and combined electroencephalogram (EEG)‐fMRI BOLD studies did not examine if the RewP is related to individual differences in functional connectivity between brain regions. Although these studies have identified brain reward regions involved in reward and loss processing, it is not clear how the connections of these brain regions influence reward and loss processing. The intrinsic connectivity of brain regions related to reward and loss responsivity can help us to better understand the network of brain regions involved in reward and loss processing. Examining intrinsic connectivity has advantages over examining task‐based neural activation (using EEG or fMRI), as it is reliable and can be more easily compared across studies and diagnostic groups (i.e., does not use a task that differs across studies and/or diagnostic groups). Indeed, growing evidence suggests neural intrinsic connectivity, as measured by resting‐state fMRI (rs‐fMRI), is an important tool for understanding distinct and common neurobiological profiles across psychiatric diagnoses (Peterson et al.,  ), which can help in informing prevention and intervention targets. Understanding the relationship between rs‐fMRI and the RewP can increase precision of the meaning of the RewP. Furthermore, most previous studies examining neural correlates of the RewP have focused exclusively on psychiatrically‐healthy individuals. Examining the relationship between intrinsic brain reward connectivity (i.e., resting‐state) and neural activity during initial responsiveness to reward and loss attainment in individuals with a range of anxiety or depression symptoms and healthy individuals is an important step toward a better understanding of individual differences in neural circuitry associated with reward and loss processing. \n\nTherefore, the current study examined associations between the RewP (Win and Loss residuals) and rs‐fMRI connectivity in reward and loss‐related brain regions among a community sample of adults with and without internalizing psychopathologies. Specifically, we examined the relationship between RewP‐Win residual and rs‐fMRI connectivity using striatal seeds (based on a prior study showing the RewP [Win >Loss] may originate from the striatum; Foti et al.,  ) to all other frontolimbic regions, and we examined the relationship between RewP‐Loss residual and rs‐fMRI connectivity using ACC seeds (based on prior studies that the FN [Loss >Win] may originate from the ACC; Dehaene et al.,  ; Miltner et al.,  ) to all other frontolimbic regions. We hypothesized that individuals with a larger RewP‐Win residual during reward would exhibit greater resting‐state functional connectivity between the striatum and mPFC (reward‐related brain regions). We also hypothesized the individuals with a larger RewP‐Loss residual would exhibit greater resting‐state functional connectivity between the ACC and other regions functionally connected to the ACC and involved in loss processing (i.e., striatum, anterior insula, mPFC, and inferior frontal gyrus; Dugre et al.,  ). Furthermore, we explored whether these relationships differed by diagnostic group (i.e., healthy controls (HC) versus individuals with internalizing psychopathology (IP)), though we did not expect differences in associations based on diagnostic group given the dimensional nature of the RewP based on theory and previous studies. \n\n\n## METHOD \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAll participants in this study were free from psychotropic medication and major medical and neurological illness as confirmed by a Board‐Certified physician. As part of a larger study that was funded by, and designed to be consistent with, the NIMH RDoC initiative, IP were enrolled if they met full threshold or sub‐threshold criteria (all but one criterion for a specific disorder) for at least one depressive or anxiety disorder, reported a total score of ≥23 on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS‐21; Lovibond & Lovibond,  ) had a Global Assessment of Functioning score of ≤60, and were seeking treatment. Exclusion criteria for HC included a current or lifetime Axis I disorder. Exclusion criteria for all participants were less than 18 or more than 65 years of age, contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (e.g., pregnancy, ferrous objects), current substance use disorder (within 6 months of the study), history of other major psychiatric illness (e.g., bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders), or current cognitive dysfunction (e.g., traumatic brain injury, pervasive developmental disorder). The University of Illinois at Chicago Institutional Review Board approved the study, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. All participants were compensated for their time and all procedures complied with the Helsinki Declaration. \n\nOne hundred and twenty‐four participants were enrolled in the study and completed both fMRI and EEG measures. Ten participants were excluded for excessive motion during the resting‐state fMRI scan, defined as >2 mm displacement in any direction. Twelve additional participants were excluded due to poor quality EEG data, defined as having fewer than 15 artifact‐free trials per condition. The final sample comprised 102 participants: 71 IP and 31 HC (see Table  ). Almost all IP met criteria for a disorder. Five IPs met subthreshold criteria for their primary disorder (three for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and two for Panic Disorder [PD])‐ among these only one IP with subthreshold PD did not meet full criteria for another disorder. All measures were collected within 2 weeks of the fMRI scan and before receiving pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy as part of the larger study. Participants were required to have a negative urine drug screen at the time of screening and prior to EEG and fMRI. \n  \nParticipant characteristics \n    \n\n### Assessment of psychopathology \n  \nLifetime diagnoses of Axis I disorders were assessed via the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐5 Disorders (SCID‐5; First et al.,  ) by a master's‐level clinician or PhD/MD assessor. Consistent with the RDoC initiative (Kozak & Cuthbert,  ), comorbidity was permitted (see Table  ). Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed with the 17‐item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM‐D; Hamilton,  ) and the 14‐item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM‐A; Hamilton,  ), respectively. Not surprisingly, individuals with a clinical diagnosis (IP) had more depression (  M   = 12.23,   SD   = 4.30; mild severity) than HCs (  M   = 0.39,   SD   = 0.67) (  F  [1101] = 231.24,   p   < .001) and anxiety (  M   = 17.55,   SD   = 6.87; mild to moderate severity) than HCs (  M   = 0.94,   SD   = 1.53),   F  (1,101) = 176.66,   p   < .001. However, IP and HC did not differ in demographic characteristics including age, years of education, gender, and race/ethnicity (see Table  ). \n\n\n###  EEG   reward task \n  \nParticipants completed a validated reward‐guessing game, the “Doors” task (see Proudfit,  ), during EEG that consisted of 40 trials. On each trial, participants were asked to choose one of two doors shown side by side on a computer monitor; the graphic remained visible until a choice was made. A fixation mark then appeared for 1000 ms, followed by a feedback screen for 2000 ms. Feedback consisted of either a green “↑”, indicating a win of $.50, or a red “↓”, indicating a loss of $.25; these amounts were chosen to give gains and losses equivalent subjective values (Tverksy & Kahneman,  ). After receiving feedback, a fixation mark was presented for 1500 ms, followed by a screen reading “Click for the next round,” which remained on‐screen until participants responded. Participants received 20 trials each of gain and loss feedback, presented in a random order. \n\n\n###  EEG   data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nContinuous EEG was recorded during the task using an elastic cap and the ActiveTwo BioSemi system (BioSemi, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Thirty‐four standard electrode sites were used. One electrode was placed on each mastoid. The EEG signal was pre‐amplified at the electrode to improve the signal‐to‐noise ratio. The data were digitized at 24‐bit resolution with a Least Significant Bit (LSB) value of 31.25 nV and a sampling rate of 1024 Hz, using a low‐pass fifth‐order sinc filter with a −3 dB cutoff point at 204.8 Hz. Off‐line analyses were performed using Brain Vision Analyzer 2 software (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). Data were re‐referenced to the average of the two mastoids and high‐pass (0.1 Hz) and low‐pass (30 Hz) filtered. Standard eyeblink and ocular corrections were performed (Miller et al.,  ) and semiautomated artifact rejection procedures removed artifacts with the following criteria: voltage step of more than 50 μV between sample points, a voltage difference of 300 μV within a trial, and a maximum voltage difference of less than 0.5 μV within 100 ms intervals. Additional artifacts were removed using visual inspection. Data were baseline corrected using the 100 ms interval prior to feedback. ERPs were averaged across win and loss trials, and the RewP was scored as the mean amplitude 250–350 ms (based on previous research [Proudfit,  ] and visualization of the scalp topography) following feedback at frontal site FCz, where the win minus loss difference was maximal (Figure  ). The mean number of artifact‐free trials for FCz for each condition were 19.14 (  SD   = 1.95) for win trials and 19.15 (  SD   = 1.92) for loss trials. The split‐half reliability Spearman–Brown coefficient for win trials was 0.78 and for loss trials was 0.82. The RewP is usually quantified as the win minus loss difference score (see Proudfit,  ), with more positive values for the difference score indicating greater reactivity to reward. However, recent evidence suggests that residuals provide a more reliable ERP measure (see Meyer et al.,  ). Therefore, we used residual RewP scores, which were calculated by regressing Loss on Win trials for RewP‐Win residual scores and by regressing Win on Loss trials for RewP‐Loss residual scores.

Topographic scalp maps of neural activity depict the win minus loss difference across the entire sample. \n  \n\n###  fMRI   data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nAn eyes‐open resting‐state functional MRI scan was collected for 8 minutes on a 3 T GE Discovery System (General Electric Healthcare; Waukesha, WI) with an 8‐channel head coil. Functional images were acquired using a gradient‐echo echo‐planar images (2 s TR, 25 ms TE, 82° flip, 64 × 64 matrix, 200 mm FOV, 3 mm slice thickness, 0 mm gap, with 44 axial slices). Imaging data were inspected and individuals with >2 mm displacement or rotation in any direction were not included in the analysis. The remaining subjects met criteria for high quality and scan stability. IP and HC did not significantly differ in peak movement (IP:   M   = 0.34 mm,   SD   = 0.31 mm; HC:   M   = 0.37 mm,   SD   = 0.26 mm), mean movement, or variability (  p  ‐values > .05). Preprocessing of fMRI data was conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuro‐Science, London, UK). Four initial volumes from each resting‐state run were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects. Images were spatially realigned, slice‐time corrected, warped to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the participant's mean functional image, resampled to 2 mm  voxels, and smoothed (8 mm  FWHM Gaussian kernel). The effects of nuisance covariates (time‐series predictors for global signal, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and movement parameters including the first derivative), obtained during realignment to account for motion‐related effects in blood‐oxygen level‐dependent (BOLD) signal, were regressed from the data following the implemented anatomical component‐based noise correction method (aCompCor; Behzadi et al.,  ). The data were then bandpass filtered to 0.01–0.09 Hz. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nAnalyses were performed using SPM8 and SPSS 24.0 (IBM). Connectivity analyses were performed using the functional connectivity (CONN) toolbox (Whitfield‐Gabrieli & Nieto‐Castanon,  ;  ) for statistical parametric mapping software (SPM8: Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). \n\n#### Functional connectivity relationship with the   RewP‐Win   and loss residuals \n  \nSeed‐based connectivity analyses were performed by calculating the temporal correlation between BOLD signals from the striatum, including bilateral caudate, putamen, and NAcc seeds to all other voxels in the brain. The caudate and putamen seeds of interest (SOIs) were defined via the AAL atlas and created using MARINA ( ; Walter et al.,  ; see Figure  ). The NAcc SOI was anatomically predefined based on prior PET studies (Martinez et al.,  ,  ; Figure  ). Visual inspection, using the Check Reg tool in SPM, showed the NAcc ROI was nearly identical to the AAL3 NAcc anatomical ROI. The ACC SOIs were defined by the CONN toolbox default atlas (see Figure  ). First level correlation maps were created for all subjects. At the second level, RewP‐Win residual values were regressed onto connectivity maps for right and left caudate, putamen, and NAcc seeds separately with group (IP, HC) as a covariate. RewP‐Loss residual values were regressed onto connectivity maps for right and left ACC seeds separately. Group differences in functional connectivity results from these models are reported in the supplement. Additional second‐level models were run for each seed with group and the interaction of group and ERP (RewP‐Win or Loss residuals) as covariates. \n  \nRelationships between RewP‐Win and resting‐state functional connectivity. Panel a shows that greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater right caudate‐mPFC connectivity, decreased right caudate‐right posterior insula connectivity, and decreased right caudate‐left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) connectivity (  p   < .05, corrected). Panel b shows that greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater left caudate‐mPFC connectivity, greater left caudate‐mOFC connectivity, and decreased left caudate‐superior medial frontal gyrus (MFG) connectivity (  p   < .05, corrected). Panel c shows that greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater right putamen‐mPFC connectivity, greater right putamen‐left superior temporal gyrus connectivity, and decreased right putamen‐left superior MFG connectivity (  p   < .05, corrected). Panel d shows that greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater left putamen‐left superior temporal gyrus connectivity, decreased left putamen‐dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) connectivity, and decreased left putamen‐bilateral superior MFG connectivity (  p   < .05, corrected). Panel e shows that greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater right NAcc‐right parahippocampal gyrus connectivity and decreased right NAcc‐bilateral superior MFG connectivity (  p   < .05, corrected). Panel f shows that greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater left NAcc‐bilateral caudate connectivity, decreased left NAcc‐right superior MFG connectivity, and decreased left NAcc‐bilateral MFG (  p   < .05, corrected). \n    \nRelationships between RewP‐Loss and resting‐state functional connectivity. Panel a shows greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to greater right ACC‐mOFC, greater right ACC‐left precentral gyrus, decreased right ACC‐right lateral MFG, and decreased right ACC‐left superior medial frontal gyrus. Panel b shows greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to greater left ACC‐mOFC, greater left ACC‐MCC, greater left ACC‐left insula connectivity, decreased bilateral ACC‐right lateral MFG, and decreased left ACC‐right IFG connectivity. \n  \nGiven our strong a priori hypotheses regarding limbic and PFC connections, all results were restricted to a pre‐determined anatomical mask. This PFC and limbic mask consisted of the entire prefrontal cortex, and many limbic and subcortical areas including the temporal pole, anterior cingulate and paracingulate, posterior cingulate, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, amygdala, caudate, putamen, pallidum, and thalamus. As a null hypothesis, we also examined results from the left primary visual cortex. Due to concerns about high rates of false positives with lenient significance thresholds and following recent guidelines (Eklund et al.,  ; Woo et al.,  ), neural activity from task effects was considered significant if it exceeded correction of multiple comparisons across the PFC and limbic mask (volume = 575,248 mm ) using cluster‐based significant thresholding to adjust for multiple comparisons within the search volume using Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 iterations) performed with the most up‐to‐date version of 3dClustSim, an adaptation of AlphaSim ( ) in AFNI (19.1.06). The mixed autocorrelation function was utilized to give an accurate estimation of non‐Gaussian noise structure (Cox et al.,  ). Significance at corrected   α   < .05 and a voxel threshold of   p   < .005 yielded a minimum cluster size of at least 60 contiguous voxels (volume = 480 mm ). In order to show the distribution of activation data in a scatterplot, we extracted parameter estimates/  β  ‐weights (arbitrary units [a.u.]) from a 10 mm radius sphere surrounding the peak activation. Functional connectivity related to the RewP‐ Win and Loss residuals were not significantly related to peak movement (  p  ‐values > .05). \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Relationship between functional connectivity and the   RewP‐Win   residual among all participants \n  \nGreater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater bilateral caudate‐medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) connectivity (Table  ; right caudate seed Figure  ; left caudate seed Figure  ) and greater left caudate‐medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) connectivity (Table  ; Figure  ). Similarly, greater RewP‐Win residual was associated with greater bilateral putamen‐left superior temporal gyrus connectivity (Table  ; right putamen seed Figure  ; left putamen seed Figure  ). In addition, greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater right NAcc‐right parahippocampal gyrus connectivity (Table  ; Figure  ), greater left NAcc‐left caudate connectivity (Table  ; Figure  ), and greater left NAcc‐right caudate connectivity (Table  ; Figure  ).

Furthermore, greater RewP‐Win residual was related to decreased right NAcc‐bilateral superior MFG connectivity (Table  ; Figure  ), decreased left NAcc‐right MFG connectivity (Table  ; Figure  ). \n\n\n### Relationship between functional connectivity and the   RewP‐Loss   residual among all participants \n  \nGreater RewP‐Loss residual was related to greater bilateral ACC‐mOFC, right ACC‐left precentral gyrus, left ACC‐MCC, and left ACC‐left insula connectivity (Table  ; Figure  ). Conversely, greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to decreased bilateral ACC‐right lateral MFG, right ACC‐left superior medial frontal gyrus, and left ACC‐right IFG connectivity (see Table  ; Figure  ).

We ran follow‐up analyses of the simple slopes for significant interactions from the SPM models to determine the direction of the results. Results of the simple slopes analyses showed that greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater right caudate‐MCC connectivity for HC (  β   = .25,   p   = .04), but not for IP,   β   = −.07,   p   = .55 (Figure  ). Similarly, greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater right caudate‐right lateral MFG/IFG connectivity for HC (  β   = .41,   p   = .02), but not for IP,   β   = −.14,   p   = .26. Furthermore, greater RewP‐Win residual was related to decreased right putamen‐left supplemental motor area connectivity for HC (  β   = −.48,   p   = .006), but not for IP,   β   = .19,   p   = .11 (Figure  ). In addition, greater RewP‐Win residual was related to decreased left putamen‐left pallidum connectivity for HC (  β   = −.44,   p   = .01), while greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater left putamen‐left pallidum connectivity for IP,   β   = .25,   p   = .04 (Figure  ). \n  \nInteraction effects of group and RewP‐Win and Loss residuals on functional connectivity \n      \nInteraction between group and ERPs on resting‐state functional connectivity. Panel a shows that greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater right caudate‐MCC connectivity (MNI peak activation [4, −2, 40]; activation circled) for HC, but not for IP in order to show the distribution of the data. Panel b shows that greater RewP‐Win residual was related to decreased right putamen‐left supplemental motor area connectivity (MNI peak activation [−14, 2, 66]; activation circled) for HC, but not for IP in order to show the distribution of the data. Panel c shows that greater RewP‐Win residual was related to decreased left putamen‐left pallidum connectivity (MNI peak activation [−18, 0, 8]; activation circled) for HC, while greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater left putamen‐left pallidum connectivity for IP in order to show the distribution of the data.

Panel e shows that greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to decreased left ACC‐left superior frontal gyrus connectivity (MNI peak activation [−12, 22, 52]; activation circled) for HC, but not for IP in order to show the distribution of the data. Panel f shows that greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to increased left ACC‐middle temporal gyrus connectivity (MNI peak activation [−48, 14, −38]; activation circled) for IP, but not for HC in order to show the distribution of the data. \n  \nAlthough the interaction between RewP‐Win residual and group was significant for left putamen‐right hippocampus connectivity, right NAcc‐MCC connectivity, and left NAcc‐ left superior temporal gyrus connectivity in SPM (see Table  ), analyses of the simple slopes found no significant simple slopes. \n\n\n### Interaction between the group and the   RewP‐Loss   residual on functional connectivity \n  \nRegions demonstrating an interaction between group and the RewP‐Loss residual on functional connectivity are shown in Table  .

In addition, greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to decreased left ACC‐left superior frontal gyrus connectivity for HC (  β   = −.41,   p   = .02), but not for IP,   β   = .11,   p   = .37 (Figure  ). On the other hand, greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to increased left ACC‐middle temporal gyrus connectivity for IP (  β   = .26,   p   = .03), but not for HC   β   = −.20,   p   = .29 (Figure  ). \n\nAlthough the interaction between RewP‐Loss residual and group was significant for right ACC‐left parahippocampal gyrus, right ACC‐left superior MFG, right ACC‐left temporal pole, right ACC‐left IFG, right ACC‐left paracentral gyrus, left ACC‐left parahippocampal gyrus, left ACC‐left IFG, and left ACC‐left paracentral gyrus in SPM (see Table  ), follow‐up analyses of the simple slopes found no significant simple slopes. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThe current study sought to examine whether the RewP (Win and Loss residuals), a neurophysiological index of reward responsiveness, was associated with resting‐state fMRI connectivity in reward‐related brain regions among adults with and without internalizing psychopathology. Results revealed that individuals with greater RewP‐Win residual amplitude demonstrated greater functional connectivity of several reward‐related brain regions. We also found that individuals with greater RewP‐Win residual amplitude showed less connectivity between striatal reward regions and regions involved in cognitive control and sensorimotor processing, including the superior MFG, IFG, dACC, and posterior insula. In addition, greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to greater connectivity between the ACC and regions involved in reward value (mOFC), loss processing (insula), motor control (precentral gyrus), and error processing (MCC), but decreased connectivity between the ACC and regions involved in cognitive control, including the lateral MFG, superior MFG, and IFG. Together, these findings indicate that connectivity of the mesocorticolimbic system may be an important individual difference factor across diagnostic groups in determining how individuals respond to the attainment of reward and loss. \n\nOur novel findings of a relationship between greater RewP‐Win residual and increased functional connectivity of brain reward regions indicates that individual differences in connectivity are associated with neurophysiological reward processing among IP and HC. Prior studies have found that the RewP (Win > Loss) may originate from the striatum (Foti et al.,  ) and that the RewP is related to BOLD and EEG activation of brain regions implicated in reward, including the striatum and mPFC during reward attainment among healthy individuals (Becker et al.,  ; Carlson et al.,  ; Foti et al.,  ; Gehring & Willoughby,  ). In the current study, we have extended these previous studies by showing for the first time that increased resting‐state connectivity of these brain reward regions, especially between striatal regions and the mPFC, were related to a greater RewP‐Win residual. We also found that increased resting‐state connectivity between striatal regions and regions in the temporal lobe, including the superior temporal gyrus and the parahippocampal gyrus, were related to greater RewP‐Win residual. These temporal regions have been shown in previous neuroimaging studies to be related to reward (see Patel et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ), especially in value representation, and are connected to the striatum via corticostriatal pathways (Haber,  ). This suggests that individuals with greater coupling between brain reward regions involved in assessing the value of a reward (superior temporal gyrus) and regions involved in goal directed behavior (striatum) may find rewarding stimuli to be more salient and/or may have a greater motivation for rewards, and therefore these individuals show greater initial responsiveness to reward. Indeed, prior studies find that individuals with a larger RewP demonstrated increased approach motivation and greater performance monitoring, especially when individuals believe that their effort led to the reward(s) (Harmon‐Jones et al.,  ; Threadgill & Gable,  ). Taken together, our findings suggest that individuals who have greater coupling between brain reward regions involved in goal‐directed behavior and reward valuation may be more motivated for rewards and better able to monitor their performance at each stage of goal pursuit, which may generally result in better performance and increased their likelihood of reward attainment. \n\nIn addition, findings demonstrated that individuals with greater RewP‐Win residual showed decreased connectivity between striatal regions and the superior MFG, left IFG, dACC, and posterior insula. The superior MFG, left IFG, and dACC are regions implicated in cognitive control (Cole & Schneider,  ; Li et al.,  ). Thus, individuals with decreased connectivity between striatal reward regions and these prefrontal cognitive control regions may have less intrinsic connectivity supporting top‐down control of rewarding stimuli and therefore show greater RewP‐Win residual during reward processing. The posterior insula has strong connections with sensorimotor areas, including the striatum, and is thought to be involved in monitoring pain and interoceptive processing (Strigo & Craig,  ). Our findings of an association between greater RewP‐Win residual and decreased connectivity between the right caudate and the right posterior insula connectivity suggest that individuals who are more responsive to rewards may have less intrinsic connectivity supporting sensorimotor processing. As such, it is possible that when presented with a reward, these individuals focus more on the external rewarding stimuli and less on internal bodily states. \n\nTo better understand how individual differences in loss responsivity are related to rs‐fMRI connectivity in loss‐related brain regions, we also examined the association between the RewP‐Loss residual and rs‐fMRI. We used ACC seeds for relationships between the RewP‐Loss residual and rs‐fMRI, based on previous source localization studies have identified that the FN (Loss > Win) may originate from the ACC (Dehaene et al.,  ; Miltner et al.,  ), a region involved in error processing and cognitive control. We found that greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to greater connectivity between the ACC and regions involved in reward value (mOFC) (Rolls et al.,  ), loss processing (insula) (Dugre et al.,  ), reward or outcome information (MCC) (Rolls,  ), and motor control (precentral gyrus) (Catani,  ). On the other hand, greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to decreased connectivity between the ACC and regions involved in cognitive control, including the lateral MFG, superior MFG, and IFG. It is interesting that we observed decreased rs‐fMRI connectivity was related to both striatal seeds for greater RewP‐Win residual and ACC seeds for greater RewP‐Loss residual. As such, individuals with decreased connectivity between striatal, as well as ACC regions and prefrontal cognitive control regions may have less intrinsic connectivity supporting top‐down control of not only rewarding stimuli, but also loss stimuli, which may result in enhanced RewP‐Win residual during reward responsivity and enhanced RewP‐Loss residual during loss responsivity. \n\nThe current study also sought to extend prior research by exploring whether associations between the RewP‐Win and Loss residuals and rs‐fMRI were comparable across IP and HC. Interestingly, the relationship between RewP and resting‐state connectivity were generally consistent across IP and HC. This indicates that intrinsic connectivity between reward‐related brain regions and fronto‐limbic regions is an important individual difference factor in reward processing that generally does not differ between psychiatrically‐healthy individuals and individuals with internalizing psychopathology. However, we found a few exceptions, in which IP status moderated the relationship between reward processing and resting‐state connectivity. Specifically, we found greater RewP‐Win residual was associated with decreased right putamen‐left supplemental motor area connectivity for HC, but not for IP. In addition, greater RewP‐Win residual was related to decreased left putamen‐left pallidum connectivity for HC, while IP demonstrated the opposite pattern‐ greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater left putamen‐left pallidum connectivity. Furthermore, greater RewP‐Win residual was related to greater right caudate‐MCC connectivity and greater right caudate‐right lateral MFG/IFG connectivity for HC, but not for IP. Therefore, it is possible that for healthy adults, individuals with greater reward responsivity demonstrate slight increases in resting‐state connectivity between reward regions and regions involved in decision‐making and response inhibition, as well as slight decreases between reward regions and between reward and motor regions. IP, however, showed a different pattern. For IP, individuals with greater reward responsivity only demonstrate slight increases in resting‐state connectivity between reward regions. These patterns may relate to dispositional characteristics such as trait impulsivity, a risk factor of self‐harm in internalizing conditions (Rawlings et al.,  ), which has been shown to predict RewP (Ait Oumeziane & Foti,  ). It also suggests reward‐related connectivity involving cognitive control may be useful in classifying diagnostic status (e.g., IP vs. HC), which has inferences for treatment. When examining how IP status moderated the relationship between the RewP‐Loss residual and rs‐fMRI connectivity, we found several significant interactions (see Table  ); however, follow‐up analyses of the simple slopes found that only two significant group differences in the relationship between the RewP‐Loss residual and rs‐fMRI connectivity. First, greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to decreased bilateral ACC‐left superior frontal gyrus connectivity for HC, but not for IP. Therefore, HC show the same pattern as the overall findings described above, such that healthy individuals with decreased connectivity between ACC loss‐related regions and prefrontal cognitive control regions may have less intrinsic connectivity supporting top‐down control of loss stimuli, which may result in enhanced RewP‐Loss residual during loss responsivity. On the other hand, this is not always the case for IP, who do not show a relationship between ACC‐left superior frontal gyrus connectivity and RewP‐Loss residual. It is possible that intrinsic connectivity supporting top‐control of loss stimuli is not as directly related to loss responsivity for IP. Second, greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to increased left ACC‐ middle temporal gyrus connectivity for IP, but not for HC. \n\nTherefore, it is possible that for healthy adults, individuals with greater reward responsivity demonstrate slight increases in resting‐state connectivity between reward regions and regions involved in decision‐making and response inhibition, as well as slight decreases between reward regions and between reward and motor regions. For IP, individuals with greater reward responsivity only demonstrate slight increases in resting‐state connectivity between reward regions. These patterns may relate to dispositional characteristics such as trait impulsivity, a risk factor of self‐harm in internalizing conditions (Rawlings et al.,  ), which has been shown to predict RewP (Ait Oumeziane & Foti,  ). It also suggests reward‐related connectivity involving cognitive control may be useful in classifying diagnostic status (e.g., IP vs. HC), which has inferences for treatment. \n\nIt is important to note that we found group differences in rs‐fMRI connectivity patterns (see Supplement). Overall, compared to HC, IP demonstrated a pattern of decreased frontostriatal rs‐fMRI connectivity, as well as decreased ACC‐MFG and ACC‐MCC rs‐fMRI connectivity. This is in line with some previous studies that found rs‐fMRI frontostriatal hypoconnectivity among individuals with depression (see Li et al.,  ). There have been fewer studies examining rs‐fMRI connectivity among individuals with anxiety disorders; however, one study found decreased resting‐state functional connectivity between reward regions including the nucleus accumbens and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) among individuals with social anxiety disorder versus healthy controls (Manning et al.,  ). On the other hand, we did find some regions that showed increased rs‐fMRI connectivity among IP compared to HC, including increased rs‐fMRI connectivity between the dorsal striatum (i.e., caudate, putamen) and regions involved in cognitive control (superior MFG) and motor/sensory processing (paracentral lobule), as well as between the ACC and regions involved in motor/sensory processing and integration (paracentral lobule, left superior temporal gyrus). More studies of individuals with depression, anxiety, and comorbid depression and anxiety are needed to better understand contributions to region‐specific decreases and increases in rs‐fMRI connectivity among individuals with internalizing disorders. \n\nAlthough the current study has several strengths, including a large sample of unmedicated adults with and without internalizing psychopathology, which allowed for comorbid internalizing psychopathology, the study also has important limitations. Data collected with EEG and fMRI were not simultaneous, therefore, possible confounds related to temporal factors cannot be ruled out. Participants had a range of internalizing psychopathology, but some principal diagnoses were under‐represented (i.e., panic disorder, PTSD) and more IP than HC made up the sample. In addition, given the high prevalence of comorbidity in the sample, we did not have enough power to examine if the relationship between RewP‐Win and Loss residuals and resting‐state connectivity differed by specific diagnoses. Thus, future studies should explore whether the degree of association between the RewP‐Win and Loss residuals and rs‐fMRI differs in a sample of healthy controls and IP without comorbidity. Furthermore, we did not find a group difference in wins, losses, or the RewP between IPs and HC. Although there is substantial evidence that depression risk is characterized by a blunted RewP (see Kujawa & Burkhouse,  ; Proudfit,  ), there is mixed evidence as to whether the RewP is associated with anxiety. Few studies have examined whether the RewP is disrupted among individuals with comorbid depression and anxiety, even though comorbidity of these disorders is extremely common. Therefore, it is possible that we did not see group differences in the RewP (or FN) due to the high prevalence of comorbid depression and anxiety in the current study. This will be important for future studies to examine. \n\nDespite limitations, results provide preliminary evidence that the RewP, a neurophysiological marker of initial response to reward, is associated with functional connectivity of brain regions implicated in reward during resting‐state fMRI. These findings indicate that individuals who are more responsive to rewards have greater connectivity between reward‐related brain regions. We also found that individuals with greater RewP‐Win residual showed decreased connectivity between striatal regions and regions involved in cognitive control and sensorimotor processing. Furthermore, we found that greater RewP‐Loss residual was related to greater connectivity between the ACC and regions involved in reward and loss processing and motor control, but decreased connectivity between the ACC and regions involved in cognitive control. Moreover, our findings were generally consistent across IP and HC though certain results were unique to IP. Therefore, connectivity of the mesocorticolimbic system appears to be an important individual difference factor related to how individuals respond to the attainment of reward and loss across individuals with and without internalizing psychopathology. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \n Natania A Crane:   Conceptualization; data curation; formal analysis; investigation; visualization; writing – original draft.

The performance of the ME-EPI was comprehensively evaluated with signal variance reduction and region-of-interest-, seed- and independent-component-analysis-based functional connectivity analyses and compared with a counterpart of single-echo EPI with the shortest TR possible. Through the multi-echo combination, the thermal noise level is reduced. Functional connectivity, as well as signal intensity, are recovered in the medial orbital sulcus and anterior transverse collateral sulcus in ME-EPI. It is demonstrated that ME-EPI provides superior sensitivity and accuracy for detecting functional connectivity and/or brain networks in comparison with single-echo EPI. In conclusion, the high-performance gradient enabled high-spatial-temporal resolution ME-EPI would be the method of choice for RS-fMRI study on the C3T. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nTo study brain activity based on hemodynamic signals, blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast has been widely used in functional MRI (fMRI) [ , ]. The gradient-recalled-echo echo-planar imaging (GRE-EPI) pulse sequence has been a workhorse for localizing brain activation regions and/or assessing intrinsic resting-state (RS) functional connectivity (FC) due to its sensitivity to BOLD signal. It has a short sampling time of a few seconds or less for whole-brain imaging. Since the source of the BOLD signal is caused by variation in magnetic susceptibility driven by vascular flow and relative deoxyhemoglobin concentration, T  change is directly related to BOLD signal [ ]. For a conventional single-echo/one-echo (OE) GRE-EPI acquisitions, the echo time (TE) used at 3T is typically set to approximately 30 ms, which is lower than the optimum (at TE~T ) and represents a good compromise between BOLD sensitivity, image quality, and temporal resolution without excessive signal losses [ , , ]. In landmark functional MRI (fMRI) studies, such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) studies, all recommend the imaging protocol of spatial and temporal resolutions less than 2.5 mm isotropic voxel and 1 s repetition time (TR), respectively [ , , ], which could be achieved with advanced imaging acceleration techniques, such as parallel imaging and simultaneous-multi-slice (multi-band, MB) imaging [ , , , ]. Although studies with multi-subject averaging with large sample sizes have shown group-level trends in RSFC, striving for better image SNR or temporal SNR (TSNR) remains a continuing effort in order to improve measurement robustness for individual subject [ , ]. \n\nCompared to single-echo acquisition, multi-echo (ME) is a fascinating approach that can address various goals in one acquisition, including sensitivity/SNR improvement and quantification of T  relaxation time for clinical and basic neuroscience research. The ME scheme has been demonstrated with robust performance in various applications, including in a line-scanning fMRI with high spatiotemporal resolutions [ ], in a combined gradient- and spin-echo acquisition for simultaneous quantify T  and T  relaxation time quantification [ ], and in blood flow measurements to quantify T  relaxation time [ ]. Recently, a deep learning model was proposed for end-to-end parametric mapping for an overlapped multi-echo sequence [ ]. Although a single echo train was used, overlapping multi-echo signals can be generated with multiple excitations. ME fMRI has been increasingly utilized in RS-fMRI studies as it can yield additional TE dependence information. For example, a study used a convolutional neural network to extract a BOLD pulsatility map from ME RS data [ ]. ME fMRI combined with independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact reduction technique has been applied to achieve improved BOLD signal quality in high-motion cohort groups like children [ ]. As a promising technological advancement in this regard, ME fMRI has been proposed and shown to be advantageous for better denoising and boosting the reliability of functional connectivity [ , , , ]. \n\nME acquisition scheme generally requires repetitive echo train measurements, which can compromise temporal resolution and lead to undesirable late echo time to go past the T  decay window. One solution to this is to use a high gradient slew rate and reduce the duration of the EPI echo spacing. Advancements in MRI scanner hardware have enabled high-performance gradients, which can directly impact the implementation and performance of the ME acquisition. In this paper, we will use a compact 3T (C3T) scanner as a technology demonstrator for ME-fMRI. A lightweight, low-cryogen C3T MRI system is equipped with a high-performance gradient system mainly for brain imaging. The gradient coil system on the C3T has an inner diameter of 42 cm, yielding a 26 cm diameter of spherical volume for whole-brain imaging. Due to its small size, it can operate at a peak slew rate of 700 T/m/s with a peak amplitude of 80 mT/m on all gradient axes simultaneously [ , , , , ] without peripheral nerve stimulation limitations [ , ]. In comparison, conventional whole-body MR scanners typically offer up to 200 T/m/s gradient slew rate and 40–80 mT/m peak gradient amplitude. The high-performance gradient system of the C3T is particularly beneficial for EPI-based acquisition. The higher gradient slew rate effectively minimizes the echo spacing and thereby reduces the readout duration [ ]. Specifically, with the intended spatial-temporal resolution, the echo spacing on the C3T is 17.9 ms, which has been reduced by 43% from the echo spacing of 31.2 ms on a whole-body scanner with a 200 T/m/s slew rate. The third echo time is 47.8 ms, which can yield a late echo with substantial signal and T  information. On the contrary, the whole-body scanner could only obtain a third echo at 81.5 ms, with the echo signal too weak to be useful. Additional benefits of reduced echo spacing includes greatly improved magnetic-susceptibility-induced geometric distortion [ , , ]. Additionally, the shortened readout improves SNR obliviating the need for a partial Fourier sampling [ ]. Furthermore, the shortened readout on the C3T enables minimal TR increase, which is helpful when high temporal resolution is desired. \n\nAlthough ME acquisition has been well demonstrated to be superior for fMRI compared to OE acquisition [ , , , , ], previous studies using ME acquisitions were conducted on conventional whole-body MRI systems with imaging parameters that marginally met the requirements for fMRI, such as a ~2 to 3 s TR and/or greater than 3 mm isotropic resolution with partial Fourier acquisition to cover the whole brain. fMRI studies prioritizing higher spatial or temporal resolutions while still maintaining whole brain coverage could not choose ME fMRI despite its benefits [ ]. Advanced gradient performance can help break the tradeoffs by enabling the desired spatial and temporal resolutions for ME fMRI that are similar to those of OE fMRI used in landmark fMRI studies [ , , ]. \n\nThe purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive investigation on the feasibility and utility of ME fMRI imaging with a high spatiotemporal resolution by comparing it with an OE fMRI acquisition with matched spatial resolution on the C3T. Our hypothesis is that ME fMRI has improved RS FC detectability on the C3T when compared with OE fMRI, the spatiotemporal resolution of which is similar to those used in the landmark fMRI studies. For a fixed acquisition time, the counterpart OE fMRI has more time frames compared to the ME fMRI. It is not clear if the advantage of ME fMRI still holds, considering the loss of temporal resolution at the spatial resolution. Thus, data from both ME and OE acquisitions were obtained on the C3T from healthy volunteers with the same acquisition parameters, except that OE uses a shorter TR. The performance of ME to OE acquisition was assessed by evaluating explained variance, SNR and TSNRs. The signal intensity recovery by ME acquisition was investigated using cortical coverage analysis and ROI-based functional connectivity. Additionally, seed- and independent-component-analysis (ICA)-based analyses in functional connectivity were used to determine the effectiveness of ME fMRI. It was demonstrated that ME-EPI provides superior sensitivity and accuracy for detecting functional connectivity and/or brain networks in comparison with OE-EPI.  \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Data Acquisition \n  \nFollowing a study protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board, 24 healthy subjects (age = 35.0 ± 10.7 years; 18 females/6 males) participated in this study after written informed consent was obtained. All subjects were scanned on the C3T using a 32-channel brain coil (Nova Medical, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA). During the RS-fMRI scans, all subjects were instructed to remain still and fix their gaze on the center of a mirror mounted on the head coil. Independent measures of physiological variables (cardiac and respiration) were recorded. \n\nRS-fMRI experiments were conducted using a ME MB gradient-echo EPI sequence with blipped-controlled aliasing in parallel imaging technique [ , ]. The fMRI datasets were separately acquired for OE and ME (three echoes) acquisitions. A whole-brain fMRI protocol, including the following imaging parameters were applied in  . ME acquisition was consecutively repeated twice to fill 10 min of scan duration due to a scanner system memory software limit on the total number of reconstructed images per series (GE Healthcare, DV26) rather than hardware restriction. \n\nAs an anatomical reference, a high-resolution T -weighted image (magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo, or MPRAGE) was obtained on the C3T with the following parameters: TR= 5.4 ms, TE = 2.4 ms, inversion time = 1000 ms, FA = 8°, resolution = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm , field of view = 25.6 × 16.6 × 25.6 cm . Gradient nonlinearity (GNL) induced distortion on all fMRI and anatomical images obtained with the C3T was corrected in the image domain retrospectively using a tenth-order inline GNL correction (gradwarp) algorithm [ , ]. \n\n\n### 2.2. Data Preprocessing for fMRI Datasets \n  \nThe preprocessing procedures for RS-EPI datasets were all carried out using AFNI (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages,  , accessed on 26 March 2021)’s suite of programs [ ]. For preprocessing and artifact reduction of the RS-EPI data, the following steps were performed in sequence: truncation by initial ten volumes to yield steady-state magnetization, de-spiking (‘3dDespike’ in AFNI), physiological noise elimination including cardiac and respiratory artifacts (‘RETROICOR’ and ‘RVT’) [ , ], slice acquisition timing correction (‘3dTshift’ in AFNI), time-series alignment, Legendre polynomial detrending and motion- and hardware-related linear regressions [ , , ], in order. For the ME dataset, a T -weighted echo combination was performed between the time-series alignment and the detrending and the regressions [ , , ] by using AFNI (‘@compute_OC_weights’). All datasets were evaluated for artifacts due to abrupt head motion, passing the sudden motion detection of AFNI at the threshold level of 0.2 mm for the Euclidean L2 norm of motion displacement during each TR interval [ ]. \n\nFor functional connectivity (FC) estimation, the artifact-reduced residual time series were bandpass-filtered with a frequency range of 0.009 to 0.1 Hz and smoothed by a Gaussian kernel with a 4 mm full-width-at-half-maximum on volume dataset (‘3dTproject’ in AFNI). The preprocessed datasets were spatially normalized into the 2.0-mm-isotropic-resolution MNI template of ‘MNI152_T1_2009c+tlrc.HEAD’ by ‘auto_tlrc’ in AFNI. For FC investigation, the two ME datasets were concatenated after time-series z-score normalization as performed in the previous study [ ] to render the final dataset with ~10-min length. \n\n\n### 2.3. Data Analysis \n  \n#### 2.3.1. Explained Variance Evaluation \n  \nTo examine the change in signal variance using a model component, namely a regressor or echo combination, the marginal   R   value was introduced to represent the proportion of the signal variance observed without individual preprocessing steps relative to the variance observed with all preprocessing steps, as performed in the previous study [ ]. The value of   R   was evaluated from: \nwhere   SS   was the error sum of squares with all preprocessing steps, and   SS   was the error sum of squares with all preprocessing steps except for a certain step. Without bandpass filtering and spatial smoothing,   R   were evaluated for the conventional artifact-related regressors of the RETROICOR [ ], ANATICOR [ ], motion and global cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal, and for the T -weighted echo combination only in ME datasets. For comparison between OE and ME acquisitions, ME datasets before the time-course scaling were used and the mean   R   values were calculated in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) voxels across all subjects. \n\nTo evaluate the dependence between artifact/noise removed by regressors and the T -weighted echo combination, the Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. The numbers of regressors for RETROICOR [ ] (up to 2nd order, including 5 regressors of RVT [ ]), motion (six parameters for rigid-body motion and their first order derivative), and global-CSF artifacts (first 3 principal components of lateral ventricles) were thirteen, twelve and three for each dataset, respectively. The single time series for each voxel was collected as an ANATICOR regressor. The noise removed by the echo combination was estimated by subtraction between echo-combined and mid-echo-only time courses. The correlation coefficients calculated across regressions and subjects were averaged by mean root square for the summary. Additionally, SNR and TSNR of ME and OE datasets were investigated across GM and WM voxels [ ], where TSNR were derived with/without the regressions to compare artifact reduction effect on TSNR in ME and OE datasets. \n\n\n#### 2.3.2. ROI-Based FC Analysis \n  \nThe effect of echo combination on signal intensity recovery was investigated for OE and ME datasets. A mask was created with the base EPI image of each dataset binarized by ‘3dAutomask’ in AFNI and converted onto a 3D surface model of ‘suma_TT_N27′ provided in SUMA [ ]. The cortical coverage was visualized by overlapping each EPI mask with the gray matter on the corresponding anatomy image [ ]. The cortical coverage ratio was evaluated as the percentage of overlap between the averaged EPI masks across subjects and the gray matter on the surface model and [ ]. \n\nThe effect of signal intensity enhancement of echo combination on FC was also investigated by ROI-based FC. 168 cortical parcellations for an individual anatomical image were defined as ROIs by FreeSurfer software [ , ]. The inter-ROI FC was evaluated as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the time courses of the two ROIs. Fisher-transformed FCs composed an FC matrix of 168 × 168. Due to regional signal dropout in images, which depended on the subject’s anatomical shape and position against the B0 field, a paired Student’s   t  -test for group comparison was applied to the FC matrices obtained from OE and ME datasets from 18 subjects. Inter-ROI FCs were thresholder with a statistically significant difference (uncorrected   p   < 0.01) and a meaningful FC value (Fisher(r)) > 0.3) in either OE or ME FCs, and the numbers of the inter-ROI FCs survived by the two thresholds were counted. \n\n\n#### 2.3.3. Seed-Based FC Map \n  \nTo examine seed-based FC extents, 10 ROIs adopted from AAL3v1 [ ] were selected as the seeds for the spatially normalized preprocessed datasets, including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula (Ins), hippocampus (Hipp), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and precentral gyrus (PCG) on both hemispheres [ , ]. To evaluate an individual FC map, the Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the time courses of each voxel and the seed regions, which were converted into a z-score by Fisher transformation. Average FC maps for both OE and ME datasets were calculated by unpaired two-sample Student’s t-tests, including one-sample tests by ‘3dttest++’ in AFNI with a covariate of global correlation (GCOR) [ ] and corrected by the FDR algorithm (‘3dFDR’ in AFNI). The group-level FC maps were statistically thresholded by the FDR-corrected   p  -value < 0.001. After statistical thresholding, the FC-magnitude threshold was applied to the seed-based group-level FC maps, and the number of voxels that survived was evaluated as the extent of FC. \n\n\n#### 2.3.4. ICA-Based FC Detection \n  \nIndependent component analysis (ICA)-based functional connectivity was investigated by using concat-ICA and dual regression methods. Concat-ICA was used to identify a set of independent component (IC) maps from the whole group of OE and ME datasets, which was performed by using the ‘melodic’ command in FSL with an option of 20 dimensions [ , , ]. Among 20 IC maps, 8 IC maps were identified as brain networks, including default mode network (DMN), lateral visual areas (LOcc), medial visual areas (MVis), right and left frontal-parietal networks (RFPN and LFPN), auditory network (Aud), executive control network (ECN), and sensorimotor network (Sens) [ ]. The whole-group IC maps were used as the inputs for dual regression and as the group truth with a statistical threshold to assess OE/ME group results derived by dual regression. \n\nDual regression was conducted by ‘dual_regression’ provided in FSL with the following two steps [ , , ]. The first step was to identify a subject-specific time course using spatial regression of the group IC maps derived by concat-ICA. The second step was to identify a subject-specific spatial map using temporal regression of the subject-specific time course. To investigate the scan time dependence, i.e., the effect of scan time length on the sensitivity and specificity of ICA-derived brain network, each subject-specific dataset was truncated to time lengths ranging from 2 to 9 min at increments of 1 min. The same dual regression was applied to each dataset with different time lengths as the group IC maps. For a statistical comparison between the ME and the OE datasets, the OE/ME groups of individual spatial IC maps were tested by using ‘randomise’ command of the FSL’s randomise permutation-testing tool (N = 5000).  \n\nIn this study, whole-group IC maps were assumed to be the ground truth for brain networks [ , ]. OE-/ME-group IC maps derived from OE/ME datasets were assessed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. For the quantitative assessment, the OE-/ME-group IC maps were binarized by a threshold of   p   < 0.001 to create the corresponding masks. The numbers of voxels were counted as true positives (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) based on the OE-/ME-group IC map mask on the corresponding whole-group IC map mask. Sensitivity, 1—specificity (as false positive rate, FPR), and accuracy for each IC map were evaluated as followings, respectively.\n \n\n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Data Selection for Analysis \n  \nAmong the total of 24 volunteers, two subjects had 70 and 48 time frames censored by the criterion in concatenated ME data and 22 and 32 in OE data, respectively, which were quite larger than the number of censored time frames of other subjects. The datasets from the subjects were considered to be contaminated with high motion [ ] and excluded for subsequent analysis. Four volunteers were scanned only with OE fMRI, without ME fMRI. Thus, 22 sets of 11-min for OE datasets and 36 sets of 5-min for ME datasets (2 sets from 18 individual subjects) were used for further analysis.  \n\nThe average translational motion per TR across datasets were 0.028 ± 0.010 mm and 0.027 ± 0.010 mm for OE and ME acquisitions, respectively, which corresponded to 0.033 ± 0.012 mm and 0.033 ± 0.012 mm average motion per second, which was much smaller than the censoring criterion of 0.2 mm. Time frames with motion exceeding 0.2 mm were censored in each dataset. 1.8 (±2.7) and 1.4 (±2.4) of time frames were censored on average (±standard deviation) for OE and ME acquisitions, respectively. Thus, the average number of samples used was 949 ± 3 and 309 ± 2 for OE and ME session, respectively. After concatenation of ME datasets, all preprocessed datasets ended up with various data length ranging from 10 min 58 s and 9 min 26 s and they were all truncated to 9-min length for comparison purpose, where 772 and 575 time frames were used for further FC analysis of OE and ME acquisitions, respectively. \n\n\n### 3.2. Explained Variance \n  \nA showed an example of   R   spatial maps in ME and OE acquisitions. A great reduction in signal variance by echo combination can be globally visualized (‘Combine’ in  A), except for regions near large vessels where   R   for the RETROICOR regressors dominates as indicated in ‘Physio’ of  A. In  B, average   R   in the GM and WM were both evaluated for conventional regressors and T -weighted echo combination of ME acquisitions and for the regressors of OE acquisitions as reference. The conventional regressors for ME acquisitions showed a similar trend in   R   values with those for OE acquisitions except for the scale.   R   for echo combination were substantially higher than   R   for other regressors. It showed that a fairly large portion of signal variance was removed through echo combination. For echo combination,   R   in WM tended to be slightly larger than in GM.  \n\nThe reduced signal variance led to improve SNR and TSNR of ME acquisitions in  C. Note that TSNR0 and TSNR were evaluated without and with artifact regression processing, respectively. In terms of TSNR, the artifact regression was more effective with ME datasets than OE datasets. TSNR gains in ME verse OE acquisitions were approximately 1.8 and 2.0 times on GM and WM, respectively. The OE acquisition has the number of time frames 34% more than the ME fMRI (700 vs. 940 ms). Considering TSNRs with the numbers of time frames like   [ ], its gains in ME verse OE acquisitions were approximately 1.56 and 1.74 times on GM and WM in the same scan time, respectively. In terms of   on GM, approximately 2.4 times longer scan time for OE acquisition would be needed to have an equivalent value to ME acquisition. \n\nCorrelations of noise reduced by echo combination were calculated and compared to those among other regressors in  D. The noise removed by echo combination was relatively independent from other regressors or itself. While a voxel-wise regressor of ANATICOR [ ] tended to be highly correlated to regressors of adjacent voxels, the voxel-wise noise removed by echo combination showed the low-level correlation with noises removed in adjacent voxels. \n\n\n### 3.3. ROI-Based FC Difference  \n  \nIn  , raw EPI images with multiple echoes were plotted with the corresponding anatomical images of a single subject. The T -weighted echo combination enhanced signal intensity effectively in brain regions with high-susceptibility as indicated. For group comparison, the cortical coverage ratio was visualized in anterior and inferior views on the standard surface model for OE and ME datasets in  A,B, respectively. The overall cortical coverage ratio was improved with ME datasets. Specifically, medial orbital sulci (olfactory sulci) and anterior transverse collateral sulci on both hemispheres as indicated in  B showed signal intensity improvement across almost all subjects, which were medial orbital sulcus and anterior transverse collateral sulcus defined as ‘S_orbital_med-olfact’ and ‘S_collat_transv_ant’ in the reference [ ], respectively. \n\nThrough the statistical comparison of 168-ROI-based FC matrices of OE and ME datasets, FC group difference of each ROI was visualized on the surface model as shown in  C. Four ROI regions, indicated by arrows in  C, had significant differences in functional connectivity, as well as in signal intensity. The locations of the four ROIs were consistent with the regions indicated in  B, where cortical coverage on the surface model was dramatically improved by echo combination. For visualization of the meaningful FCs from the four ROIs, i.e., |Fisher(r)| > 0.3, the BrainNet Viewer [ ] was used to plot edges for inter-ROI functional connections derived from the four ROIs. In  D,E, OE datasets showed a much smaller number of FCs from the red nodes than ME datasets. \n\n\n### 3.4. Seed-Based FC Extents \n  \nSeed-based group-level FC maps were obtained with datasets statistically thresholded with FDR-corrected   p   < 0.001. Each estimated FC extent was limited with |Fisher(r)| > 0.3. Note that Fisher(r) denoted Fisher-transformed Pearson correlation coefficient.  A showed average FC maps derived from 10 seeds as group results of 9-min-length OE and ME datasets. ME FC maps showed similar or stronger clusters than the OE FC maps for seeds placed in PCG, Ins, and PCC. For seeds placed in Hipp and ACC, ME datasets detected additional clusters in FC maps as indicated by arrows in  A.  B showed quantitative comparisons of the group-level FC extents with 9-min-length datasets, where ME produced broader FC extents with higher number of voxels than OE in most seed-based FC maps. Especially, for Hipp and ACC seeds, FC extents of ME datasets were approximately up to 3 times larger than those of OE datasets. \n\n\n### 3.5. ICA-Based FC Detection \n  \nEight IC maps were identified as well-known intrinsic brain networks from 20 IC components. Group-level IC maps calculated by dual regression and permutation test with truncated OE/ME datasets are shown in  A. IC maps were derived by datasets thresholded by FDR corrected   p  -value < 0.001. Visually, group-level IC maps from ME datasets showed stronger and broader connectivity than those from OE datasets. Sensitivity, false positive rate (FPR, as ‘1-specificity’) and accuracy of OE/ME group IC maps were evaluated with a threshold of FDR corrected   p   < 0.001. In  B, the averages of all three metrics across eight IC maps were plotted against scan length. ME datasets produced higher sensitivity than OE datasets through all scan times. Scan lengths shorter than 2 min failed to show acceptable levels of sensitivity for both groups as expected. As sensitivity increased along scan length, although FPR increased for both groups, overall, it remained at a very low level (<0.004) for the threshold. The accuracy of the ME group was superior to that of the OE group at all scan time lengths. For example, a 4-min ME acquisition was comparable to an 8-min OE acquisition in terms of sensitivity and accuracy. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn this study, the feasibility and capability of multi-echo fMRI was investigated on C3T with the high-performance gradient system. Three-echo fMRI was achieved with a spatial resolution of 2.4-mm isotropic voxel without partial Fourier sampling and a temporal resolution less than 1 s. The spatio-temporal resolution is comparable to the OE fMRI protocols used in landmark fMRI studies, such as HCP, ABCD and ADNI projects [ , , ]. The shortened echo spacing enabled by higher slew rate allowed for additional echoes to be inserted at a relatively high spatial and temporal resolution with slight increase in TR. Since the ME acquisition extend the TR of OE from 700 ms to 940 ms, ME would yield fewer time frames than OE for a fixed amount of scan time. Our investigation strived to find out if the prospect of ME still holds despite of the loss of temporal resolution. The performance comparison of the ME over the OE acquisition with matched spatial resolution were assessed using signal variance and different types of functional connectivity analyses for further understanding. Compared to the OE acquisition, the ME acquisition was shown to have greatly reduced in thermal noise variance and recovered signal intensity/functional connectivity at brain regions suffering from high susceptibility. This resulted in a broad extent FC with several clusters in seed-based RSFC analysis, even in the regions of hippocampus and ACC suffering from distortions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ME acquisition provided superior sensitivity and accuracy for detecting intrinsic brain networks in ICA-based RSFC analysis. Hence, a ME acquisition with higher TSNR and broader functional coverage was more beneficial than an OE acquisition with higher temporal resolution using the high-performance gradient on the C3T. With the advent of more high-performance gradient, such as the MAGNUS gradient insert [ ] and Connectome 2.0 gradient [ ], this study can shed some light to investigators who have access to these systems on which sequence to choose between ME-EPI or OE-EPI for RS-fMRI studies.  \n\nThe absence of a direct comparison with conventional whole-body 3T scanner is primarily due to limitations of whole-body scanner gradients. To achieve the same spatial resolution and brain coverage, the three echo times on whole-body scanner (i.e., GE 750 3T MRI scanner) would be 19.1 ms, 50.3 ms, and 81.5 ms, respectively. The last echo would be far out in the T  decay window and useless for signal contribution. As shown in  , an imaging parameter comparison at various isotropic spatial resolutions ranging from 1.4 mm to 3.5 mm showed a significant gap between the C3T and a conventional GE 750 scanner (200 T/m/s gradient slew rate and 50 mT/m peak gradient amplitude), where echo times, repetition time, echo spacing, and inter-TE duration were present depending on isotropic voxel size available on the C3T and conventional whole-body scanners. In this survey, full sampling in k-space was applied because partial Fourier sampling causes spatial resolution loss in phase-encoding direction. 2.4 mm imaging on the C3T scanner can achieve similar echo times, TR and inter-TE duration to those in 3.5 mm imaging on a conventional scanner. Even though the voxel volume in 2.4 mm imaging is only at 32.2% of the voxel volume in 3.5 mm imaging, it was demonstrated that 2.4 mm OE imaging could produce sufficient SNR for fMRI protocol in the functional MRI studies [ , ]. Thus, the study on the conventional whole-body 3T was omitted and we chose to only focus on the ME and OE comparison on the C3T. Additionally, our previous OE fMRI study between the C3T and the conventional 3T scanners demonstrated that the shortened echo spacing directly mitigates the geometric distortion on naïve EPI images to improve fidelity in a registration with anatomy images [ ]. It was expected that this improvement is still valid for ME imaging on the C3T. \n\nIn this study, 3-echo acquisition was chosen based on the balanced consideration of T  decay window, temporal resolution, and number of echoes for the spatial resolution that we used as shown in  . The fourth echo would fall close to T ~66.0 ms of a gray matter at 3T [ ] and yield minimum signal, which would not contribute much to the combined-echo SNR. Additionally, any echoes added after the third one won’t be beneficial to signal recovery for a voxel with short T  because the first echo dominates the signal recovery in the T -weighted echo combination. On the other head, echoes with longer TE (>60 ms) could potentially be beneficial for voxels with long T  and helpful in accurate estimation of T  [ ] or the automated classifier for TE-dependent signal, i.e., BOLD component in MEICA [ ], which will be included in future study. \n\nThe signal variance in RS-fMRI could originate from various sources, such as pulsation and respiration, head motion, CSF fluctuation, hardware malfunction, and thermal noise, as well as BOLD signal. Preprocessing steps to improve sensitivity for functional connectivity have been developed to reduce the effect of artifacts caused by well-known sources, such as physiological fluctuation, head motion, and hardware instability [ , , , ]. For signal variance reduction related to thermal noise, smoothing and filtering have widely been used. For ME preprocessing, T -weighted echo combination has been used as a conventional method to boost contrast-to-noise and BOLD sensitivity [ ]. We evaluated the impact of the echo combination on signal variance reduction. The reduced variance by echo combination was greater than from other regressors and tended to be uniformly distributed across the whole brain. Interestingly, the noise reduced by echo combination was not strongly correlated with other regressors and noise from adjacent voxels. This could be attributed to the fact that the variance removed by echo combination originated from thermal noise, since this is not strongly correlated with other artifact sources or the BOLD signal. \n\nAlong with the reduction in signal variance, ME fMRI produced the same or higher sensitivity for functional connectivity than the OE fMRI results via various FC analyses. This indicates that the small BOLD signal is well preserved during the echo combination and that the variance reduction is related to thermal noise rather than other noise/artifact sources. Since there is no specific regression model for thermal noise in the absence of temporal or spatial filtering, ME providing a higher SNR could be a preferred method over OE acquisition for RS-fMRI. Additionally, the   R   of the echo combination in WM appeared to be higher than in GM because WM has a lower level of signal variance than GM due to less BOLD signal variance and other physiological noise sources [ ]. \n\nIn the ICA-based FC evaluations, enhanced sensitivity was demonstrated for ME compared to OE acquisition. Although slightly higher FPRs were also observed for ME compared to OE acquisition, in all cases they are relatively low (<0.01) for all threshold values. In terms of accuracy, ME acquisition outperforms OE acquisition at statistical threshold with   p   < 0.001. The time dependency analysis indicated that ME acquisition with a shorter scan time could be considered as a better substitute to longer OE acquisition for RS-fMRI studies as they showed comparable sensitivity and accuracy. \n\nPrevious task-based BOLD fMRI studies have shown that signal intensity enhancement by echo combination offers the opportunity to study regions with rapid susceptibility spatial variation, especially along the inferior cerebral hemispheres, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex [ , ]. Inter-ROI FC comparison in this study with high performance gradients supports that signal intensity enhancement by echo combination helps to extract even spontaneous BOLD signal in regions of high susceptibility, such as medial orbital sulci (olfactory sulci) and anterior transverse collateral sulci. Echo combination has yet to fully recover signal dropout that intrinsically occurs in EPI acquisition. When it is combined with other susceptibility reduction techniques, such as z-shimming [ ], it is expected to further improve cortical coverage. \n\nICA-based fMRI de-noising methods, such as ICA-AROMA, MEICA, TEDANA, etc. [ , ] has shown the potential for data quality improvements, as well as the capability to subject-specifically separate signal versus noise/artifacts. These methods could provide noise and artifact component removal and, thus, improved performance for FC detection [ , ]. The primary focus of this work is to compare the benefit of only ME combination to the shorter (but comparable) TR of OE acquisition on the condition of high-spatial-temporal resolution implementation, especially when it is performed on the C3T fully using the high gradient slew rate. However, the IC classifiers for these ICA-based de-noising methods were extensively studied with relatively higher SNR fMRI data, such as low-spatial-temporal resolution fMRI datasets. As described in previous studies [ , , ], the classifiers could fail in case of ambiguous components and an expert/interpreter may be required to manually intervene and decide whether components were classified correctly. For these reasons, ICA-based de-noising methods were excluded in preprocessing of data cleaning in this study, which would be examined in future study. Instead of detecting ICA-based subject-specific artifact components, concat-ICA was applied to detect ‘well-known’ brain network components common to all subjects and all datasets. Echo combination served as a single extra pre-processing step for the ME fMRI. All the other denoising steps remained the same between ME and OE acquisitions. Even without ICA-based denoising pre-processing, ME fMRI still outperforms OE fMRI based on several analysis methods.  \n\nA limitation in this study was that the scan length of the ME acquisition was restricted by a scanner software limit on the total number of reconstructed images per scan. With the limit, the proposed ME imaging protocol ( ) was restricted to only 5 min per scan. To achieve a longer scan length, two ME scans had to be performed consecutively and concatenated together afterwards. Due to this, there is a potential loss in temporal continuity introduced by data truncation and concatenation. Since RS FC estimates are modulated by slow frequency dynamics with cycles on the order of several minutes [ ], data truncation of any RS-fMRI dataset could cause biased reliability and reproducibility in FC estimate [ ]. As an alternative approach, data scrubbing, such as delta function regression has been suggested to minimize a loss in reliability and reproducibility on the FC estimate [ ]. Although the previous study demonstrated that data concatenation could improve the reliability of functional connectomics [ ], it is still unclear how a potential loss in temporal continuity caused by the data concatenation would influence the FC estimate [ ]. With a recent software upgrade of the C3T scanner, the system currently allows a non-stop acquisition of the ME scan over 10 min. This enables comparison of concatenated data with data acquired without discontinuity. As part of future works, the effect of data concatenation with different preprocessing steps will be investigated.  \n\nFor future works, the enhanced sensitivity of ME fMRI will be applied to clinical RS-fMRI studies of aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia as the brain suffers from signal dropout in regions with iron deposition and increased partial volume effect due to brain atrophy [ ]. Additionally, ME fMRI provides opportunities for improved functional connectivity detection in regions, such as the hippocampus and ACC, which would benefit cognitive neuroscience studies related to memory or cognition [ ]. From a technical point of view, the choice of echo number for ME fMRI needs to be evaluated when ICA-based fMRI methods are used for denoising and motion correction. The ME acquisition studied here is based on 2D EPI acquisition. Emerging new techniques, such as wave-CAIPI [ , ] could potentially enable 3D ME imaging. The high-performance gradient on the C3T would also be beneficial for shortening the sinusoidal acquisition window and facilitate ME fMRI, which makes it an interesting topic for future study.  \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nMulti-echo-EPI acquisition was feasible with a spatial resolution < 2.5 mm isotropic voxel and a temporal resolution < 1 s on a high-performance gradient system of C3T and was demonstrated to provide superior SNR, TSNRs, sensitivity and accuracy to the corresponding OE-EPI acquisition with matching spatial resolution despite the temporal resolution loss. The high-performance gradient enabled high-spatial-temporal resolution ME EPI would be the method of choice for RS-fMRI study on the C3T. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"79e1ee8b9e0a4d913a8976698b76e46a"},

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Binswanger's disease (BD) share similar symptoms and common brain changes that can confound diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate correlated structural and functional brain changes in AD and BD by combining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion MRI. A group independent component analysis was first performed on the fMRI data to extract 49 intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Then we conducted a multi-set canonical correlation analysis on three features, functional network connectivity (FNC) between ICNs, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Two inter-correlated components show significant group differences. The first component demonstrates distinct brain changes between AD and BD. AD shows increased cerebellar FNC but decreased thalamic and hippocampal FNC. Such FNC alterations are linked to the decreased corpus callosum FA. AD also has increased MD in the frontal and temporal cortex, but BD shows opposite alterations. The second component demonstrates specific brain changes in BD. Increased FNC is mainly between default mode and sensory regions, while decreased FNC is mainly within the default mode domain and related to auditory regions. The FNC changes are associated with FA changes in posterior/middle cingulum cortex and visual cortex and increased MD in thalamus and hippocampus. Our findings provide evidence of linked functional and structural deficits in dementia and suggest that AD and BD have both common and distinct changes in white matter integrity and functional connectivity. \n   Highlights  \n  \nThis is the first study to explore multi-modalities changes in different dementia. \n  \nA multimodal fusion method is applied to identify joint components. \n  \nBrain abnormalities in different modalities are highly correlated. \n  \nAlzheimer's and Binswanger's disease share similar brain changes. \n  \nAlzheimer's and Binswanger's disease also have distinct brain changes. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older individuals ( ). In the first decade of the 21st century, mortality caused by AD increased by 71%, making AD the sixth leading cause of death in the United States ( ). Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), the second most common cause of dementia, has become a major public health concern because of the realization of its impact on the pathogenesis of AD ( ;  ;  ;  ). The most common form of VCID is sub-cortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD), which can be divided into two subtypes: Binswanger's disease (BD) and lacunar state. In contrast to lacunar state, BD presents insidiously and follows a slowly progressive course similar to AD ( ;  ). The clinical distinction between AD and BD can be challenging because of their overlapping symptoms as well as their high prevalence in elderly individuals. Therefore, additional neuroimaging features are needed to distinguish these two conditions and make the diagnosis more certain. \n\nNeuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) are more specific and biologically based approaches for detecting brain changes and have been widely employed to probe brain alterations in many brain diseases. White matter (WM) injury on sMRI serves as a prominent brain marker for BD, though about 30% of typical AD patients show similar lesions ( ;  ;  ;  ). dMRI assesses WM ultrastructure by quantifying diffusion of water within WM tracts. Mounting evidence has shown dMRI to be more sensitive to WM injury than T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery on sMRI, detecting abnormal diffusion in radiographically normal appearing regions. A wide range of WM abnormalities in both AD and BD have been identified in dMRI studies ( ;  ;  ;  ). For example, Stahl and colleagues have found that AD patients show reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the temporal lobe ( ). FA differences between AD and healthy controls (HCs) were also identified in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus ( ). Studies also identified similar WM abnormalities in BD. A previous study demonstrated that reductions of FA in both regions of the corpus callosum, more in anterior than posterior brain regions in BD patients, suggesting axonal damage and demyelination of fibers ( ). \n\nfMRI measures brain activity in the gray matter (GM) by evaluating changes associated with blood flow. Investigating resting-state brain functional connectivity from fMRI provides a means for understanding the mechanisms and relevance of the functional relationships between brain regions. AD is characterized by widespread GM changes and disconnection of cortical and sub-cortical regions ( ;  ;  ;  ). The default-mode network, one of the most widely-studied resting-state networks, is significantly affected by AD. Research has shown that AD patients have decreased resting-state/task activity in the default-mode and hippocampal regions, suggesting disrupted connectivity between these regions ( ;  ). Studies also identified atypical functional connectivity between the hippocampus and several default-mode regions, such as medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and PCC ( ;  ). Hence, atypical functional network properties may provide another important biomarker of AD. A recent study combined graph theoretical approaches with machine learning methods to study the AD-related fMRI changes. They showed that three graphic metrics, clustering coefficient, local efficiency, and normalized local efficiency successfully separated patients with AD and healthy controls with 100% accuracy ( ). Although it has also been suggested that resting-state fMRI may provide additional valuable biomarkers of BD ( ), very limited studies have investigated resting-state functional connectivity in this condition. \n\nQuantitative functional and structural brain alterations have been identified in AD and BD, but many investigations favor one data type only, leaving potentially hidden relationships between different imaging modalities undetected. Therefore, studies of multimodal features are needed to clarify disparate findings in neural imaging ( ;  ). During the past decade, increasing studies have used multimodal data to investigate brain changes in AD ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, these studies typically analyze each modality independently, thus still not evaluating interactions between them. Data fusion is an alternative strategy which analyzes multimodal data jointly and can effectively detect multimodal brain changes related to diseases. The multi-set canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) is one of the promising methods for the exploration of co-impairments in multimodal imaging data. Specifically, it is a data-driven method that decomposes features of each modality into spatial maps (SMs) and their corresponding canonical variants ( ;  ), and aim to identify co-varying brain patterns among two or more modalities by maximizing the inter-modality correlations between canonical variants. The superior performance of MCCA in achieving jointly associated multimodal components have been shown in comprehensive simulation studies ( ,  ;  ). Although MCCA is primarily designed to find associations in multi-modalities ( ,  ;  ), it is also suitable for identifying joint alterations among different modalities in diseases ( ;  ). MCCA has been successfully applied in numerous studies for the exploration of diseases-related multimodal co-alterations. For example, Croitor-Sava et al. have found that the multimodal information captured by this method can contribute to the brain tumor classification ( ). Correa et al. also showed interesting joint alterations between fMRI and gray matter volume using MCCA, with schizophrenia patients having larger functional activity in motor areas and smaller activity in temporal areas ( ). Sui and her colleagues used MCCA to analyze three types of neuroimaging features from fMRI, sMRI, and dMRI and identified one multimodal component which is not only group differentiating but also highly correlated with the schizophrenic cognitive impairments ( ). More importantly, their results of this joint component integrated many separated findings in single modality studies ( ;  ;  ). Taken together, the MCCA method is believed to be a powerful tool for finding the potential linkages between multi-modalities and assessing the brain impairments associated with these linked components. \n\nThough multimodal brain changes have been widely studied in many brain disorders, to our knowledge, no report has used fMRI and dMRI data fusion to investigate both commonalities and differences between AD and BD. Understanding the joint changes in different modalities related to AD and BD may advance our knowledge of dementia's mechanism and provide potential multimodal biomarkers for better clinical diagnosis of different dementias. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a fusion analysis to investigate correlated functional and structural brain changes in AD and BD. Results may reveal important joint brain abnormalities which cannot be detected from a single modality. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects and dataset acquisition \n  \nSubjects were collected from an ongoing study of VCID at the University of New Mexico (UNM). In total 124 subjects received MRI scans, including 34 HCs, 18 patients with AD, 16 patients with BD, 11 patients with mixed dementia (AD+BD), 12 patients with leukoaraiosis, 8 patients dementia with Lewy bodies, 8 patients with frontotemporal dementia, 7 patients with Parkinson's disease and 10 patients with psychiatric disorders. HCs were recruited from the community with normal neuropsychological and neurological examinations and patients were recruited from the neurologists' cognitive disorders clinics. \n\nClinical consensus diagnoses were established after at least one year of clinical follow-up. All patients met the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5R) criteria for dementia ( ). Patients diagnosed with AD presented with insidious onset of predominant amnestic disorder associated with one additional cognitive domain, following NINCDS-ADRDA clinical criteria for probable AD ( ;  ). In addition, they conformed to the recent biological diagnostic criteria for AD, which includes the biomarkers of the AD pathophysiologic process, low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Αβ /Αβ  and elevated phospho-Tau  ( ). White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on FLAIR MRI were analyzed by both the semiquantitative visual scale of Fazekas ( ) and the quantitative measurement of WMH volume using an automated program (JIM,  ). Patients diagnosed with BD met both the Erkinjuntti criteria ( ) for subcortical vascular dementia and the recent consensus statement for BD ( ). These patients had predominant dysexecutive syndrome and neurological examination evidence consistent with cerebrovascular injury. All BD patients showed extensive WMH in their MRI scans. Clinical diagnosis of BD was supported in the majority through the absence of AD biomarkers (normal phospho-Tau ). Subjects had been assessed with cognitive tests. Cognitive tests were administered by a trained research psychologist (JP) and trained research coordinators and scored according to standard procedures. Standardized (T) scores were calculated for each test. Average composite T-scores were calculated for five domains ( ): memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Delay, Rey Complex Figure Test-Long Delay), executive function (Digit Span Backwards, Trail Making Test B, Stroop - Interference Score, and Controlled Oral Word Association [FAS]), attention (Digit Span Forward, and Trial Making Test A), language (Boston Naming 60 item test, Controlled Oral Word Association [Animals]) and processing speed (Digit Symbol and Symbol Search, both based on WAIS-3). Research has demonstrated that objective tests should focus on multiple cognitive domains to increase the ability to detect full cognitive impairments ( ;  ;  ). We believed that the use of summarized scores for different cognitive domains helps capture more reliable cognitive impairments in dementia.   \nParticipant demographics. \n  Table 1   \n\nWe included all available subjects 1) with head motion ≤ 3° and ≤ 3 mm; 2) with functional data providing near full brain successful normalization (detailed procedures are provided in the supplementary materials) for the ICA and the fusion analysis because larger samples provide more a robust and stable estimation of components ( ;  ;  ). These criteria resulted in a total of 113 subjects. Only the HC, AD, and BD groups were further analyzed in subsequent statistical analyses (31 HCs, 15 patients with AD and 15 patients with BD). \n\n\n### Imaging parameters \n  \nParticipants were scanned during the eyes-closed rest condition. fMRI Scans were acquired on a 3 T dedicated head scanner (Siemens TIM Trio). Two different head coils were employed during different stages of recruitment, a 12-channel radio-frequency (RF) coil and a 32-channel RF coil with a multi-band sequence. The 12-channel fMRI data were scanned using gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) which had FOV = 240 mm, with a 3.5 mm slice thickness and 30% distance factor, a 3.75 × 3.75 mm in-plane resolution, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 29 ms, anterior-posterior (AP) phase encoding direction, and 165 measurements collected for a total acquisition time of 5.5 min. The 32-channel fMRI data were scanned using a multi-band EPI sequence which had a FOV = 248 mm, 3x3x3 mm voxel resolution, multi-band factor = 8, TR = 460 ms, TE = 29 ms, anterior-posterior phase encoding direction, and 650 measurements collected for a total acquisition time of 5 min. Data for distortion correction were collected using two additional EPI spin-echo sequences run in AP and posterior-anterior (PA) phase encoding directions. The image resolution, echo-spacing, and bandwidth of the EPI fMRI sequence and the EPI spin-echo sequence were matched. \n\nThe 12-channel dMRI sequence had 35 gradient directions, b = 800 s/mm  and 5 b = 0 measurements for an acquisition time of 6 min. The b = 0 measurements were interleaved after every six non-zero b-value measurements. dMRI data were obtained in the axial direction along the AC–PC line. The FOV was 256 × 256 mm with a 2 mm slice thickness, 72 slices, 128 × 128 matrix size, voxel size = 2 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm, TE = 84 ms, TR = 9000 ms, NEX = 1, partial Fourier encoding of 3/4, and with a GRAPPA acceleration factor of 2. The 32-channel dMRI used a multi-band sequence consisting 165 gradient directions with b-values = 800, 1600, and 2400 s/mm , and eight b = 0 values, uniformly distributed over the whole sphere. Data were collected axially with an approximately equal number of volumes in the AP/PA phase encoding directions. The diffusion sequence had 2 mm isotropic resolution with 72 slices, TR = 4000 ms, TE = 108 ms, and a multi-band factor, MB = 3 (13 min). \n\nfMRI preprocessing was performed using a combination of toolboxes: AFNI3 ( ), SPM12 ( ), GIFT4.0b ( ), and custom code written in MATLAB. We performed rigid body motion correction using the toolbox in SPM to correct subject head motion, followed by the slice-timing correction to account for timing differences in slice acquisition. Then the fMRI data were despiked using the AFNI3 3dDespike algorithm to mitigate the impact of outliers. The fMRI data were subsequently warped to a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template and were resampled to 3 mm  isotropic voxels. All functional images were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 6 mm). For the 32-channel fMRI data, additional distortion correction was conducted. A distortion field was calculated from the AP and PA phase-encoded EPI data by the TOPUP/FSL algorithm ( ). This distortion field was then used to correct the fMRI images. This was followed by motion correction and spatial normalization steps. Based on the 6 realignment parameters, we calculated the mean of the absolute translation and the mean of the absolute rotation for the selected subjects. We compared these head motion parameters among groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results show that there is no group difference on the head motion (translation:   p   = .1566; rotation:   p   = .2131). \n\ndMRI preprocessing was similar for the 12-channel and the 32-channel RF coil data. The preprocessing steps consisted of a) Distortion and Motion correction and b) Quality control check. The data processing was primarily based on the FSL software (// ) with a custom MATLAB routine for quality check. The distortion correction methods were different for the two coils data sets. In the case of the 32-channel RF coil, the diffusion data was collected in the AP and the PA phase encoding directions. We first estimated the distortion field by the TOPUP/FSL routine based on the reversed phase encoding diffusion data. Then EDDY/FSL together with the distortion field was applied to correct for distortion as well as motion related artifacts. This ability to calculate the distortion field was not available for the 12-channel data. In this case, the FLIRT/FSL algorithm with 12 degrees of freedom, affine transformation, and mutual information as the cost function was used for motion correction by registering the images to the first b = 0 image. This was followed by a MATLAB routine which checked for signal dropout because of motion and/or the presence of excessive motion as reported by the motion correction algorithm. A subject was excluded from further analysis if it had >10% of bad volumes. Similar to fMRI, we compared the mean of the absolute translation and the mean of the absolute rotation among groups and found no group difference on the head motion (translation:   p   = .3511; rotation:   p   = .6222). \n\n\n### Feature extraction \n  \n#### fMRI feature \n  \nFunctional network connectivity (FNC) between components was calculated and used as the fMRI feature. Spatial GICA was performed on preprocessed fMRI data to define the regions of interest. Principal components analysis (PCA) was firstly performed on each subject to reduce subject-specific data into 120 principal components which preserve >99% of the variance. Secondly, the first level reduced data were concatenated and then reduced to 100 principal components using expectation maximization algorithm ( ). Thirdly, the infomax algorithm was used to decompose the second level reduced group data into 100 independent components (ICs) and estimate the group level spatial maps (SMs). ICASSO was applied on 20 ICA runs and the best-run was chosen to stabilize the estimation ( ). ICASSO is a software package which is capable of investigating the relations between estimates from ICA ( ). The SMs and their corresponding time-courses (TCs) were back-reconstructed based on the group SMs using a spatially constrained algorithm called group information guided ICA (GIG-ICA) ( ;  ). We selected a relatively high model order (number of ICs, C = 100) for the functional parcellation of brain components to probe more detailed inter-connected information of the functional regions. Using such a high model order is consistent with our previous static and dynamic FNC studies in other brain disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nAfter obtaining subject-specific SMs and TCs of all ICs, one-sample   t  -test maps for each SM and the mean power spectra of each TC were computed. We chose a set of ICs that cover the majority of sub-cortical and cortical GM as intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) for FNC feature extraction by visual inspection using the same criteria described in our previous studies ( ;  ;  ;  ). That is, those components identified as ICNs should exhibit peak activations in gray matter, low spatial overlap with known vascular, ventricular, motion, and susceptibility artifacts, and should have TCs dominated by low-frequency fluctuations ( ). The selected ICNs were categorized into different functional domains according to anatomy and prior knowledge of their function. We defined additional hippocampal domain because we want to highlight the hippocampal regions that are typically involved in dementia studies. It should be noted that the organization of different ICNs into different functional domains is just used for better visualization of the results and does not have any influence on the fusion analysis. Before calculating the FNC between ICNs, the following post-ICA processing steps were conducted on the TCs to remove remaining noise sources: 1) detrending linear, quadratic, and cubic trends; 2) conducting multiple regressions of the 6 realignment parameters and their temporal derivatives; 3) de-spiking detected outliers; 4) low-pass filtering with a cut-off frequency of 0.15 Hz. The Pearson correlation coefficient between TCs was calculated after post-processing as the measure of the fMRI feature. \n\n\n#### dMRI feature \n  \nThe fractional anisotropy (FA) and the mean diffusivity (MD) maps were calculated by the DTIFIT/FSL algorithm. The FA images were non-linearly spatially normalized to an FA MNI template (FNIRT/FSL) and then this transformation was also applied to the MD images to transform them to the MNI template. This resulted in a 91x109x91 matrix with the voxel size of 2x2x2 mm for FA and MD maps. The FA and MD maps were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 6 mm) before the fusion analysis. \n\n\n\n### Fusion analysis \n  \nSince the data were scanned using two different head coils, before the fusion analysis, we corrected the head coil effect from the fMRI and dMRI features. Among 113 subjects used in the fusion analysis, 76 subjects (including 20 HCs, 13 AD patients, 6 BD patients, and 37 other patients) were scanned with a 32-channel RF coil and 37 subjects (including 11 HCs, 2 AD patients, 9 BD patients, and 15 other patients) were scanned with a 12-channel RF coil. A generalized linear model (GLM) was applied to the features of 31 HCs to estimate the effect of the different head coils. We used only the features from HC for the estimation to avoid confounding effects related to diseases. After obtaining the effect of head coils, we regressed out this effect from all subjects. The confounding effect of head coils was removed from each feature (FNC, FA, and MD). \n\nNext, FA and MD feature masks were created to extract significant dMRI features for fusion analysis. That is, for the FA feature, we calculated the individual mask for each subject by setting voxels which are >90% of the whole brain mean to 1. Next, we computed a feature mask for all subjects by setting voxels which are included in >90% of the subjects to 1. For the MD feature, we generated a feature mask by excluding the ventricles and other possible CSF regions. The 2D FNC feature and the 3D dMRI features (FA and MD inside the feature masks) of each subject were reshaped into a one-dimensional non-zero vector and stacked one by one, forming a matrix with dimensions of subject x [number of features] for each feature, respectively. To make different features into the same range with the same average sum of squares, the feature matrix was normalized. We used a single normalization factor for each feature to guarantee that the relative scaling within a feature was preserved, but the units between features were the same ( ). \n\nThe normalized features were jointly analyzed by MCCA, which is capable of characterizing the linked patterns among different features. Research has shown that MCCA can detect flexible co-occurring abnormalities from different modalities and is a powerful tool to provide additional information of brain disorders which cannot be captured in single modality analysis ( ;  ;  ). The flowchart of the MCCA approach is displayed in  . MCCA is an extension of traditional CCA method which is used to find the optimal transformed coordinate system which can maximize the correlation between the canonical variants of different data features. Different from two-way CCA, MCCA is a multiple-stage optimization method which explores the linear combination of components that maximizes the correlations between canonical variants in each stage ( ). Consistent with our previous studies, we used the modified minimum description length (MDL) criterion to estimate the number of components for each feature (FNC, FA, and MD) ( ). The final component number for fusion analysis was set as the maximum value of the estimated component number for each feature, which maximally retains the joint information ( ).   \nFlowchart of the multi-set canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) on multiple features, which enabels capturing multimodal alterations. Step 1: extract functional network connectivity (FNC) features from fMRI data and fractional anisotropy (FA)/mean diffusivity (MD) features from dMRI data; Step 2: run MCCA method on these features. The MCCA optimizes an objective function of the correlation matrix of the canonical variants from multiple random vectors such that the canonical variants achieve maximum overall correlation. The MCCA will separate each feature into canonical variants (A ) and spatial maps (C ) and the canonical variants will have high correlations across modalities. In our present study, the feature matrix of each modality is decomposed into 26 canonical variants and 26 corresponding spatial maps (SMs), M = 26. The canonical variants represent how the components distributed in participants. AD, Alzheimer's disease; BD, Binswanger's disease. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### Correlation analysis and group difference detection \n  \nThe association between canonical variants of paired-features was measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient. A permutation test was conducted to mitigate against overfitting. We permutated each feature across subjects and then performed MCCA on the permutated data 2000 times. Then we calculated the correlation between canonical variants to generate the null distribution. If the correlations between canonical variants of components (regressed out the group label information) from the original data are larger than 95% of the correlations between canonical variants from the permutated data, we set these components as components of interest (COIs). ANOVA was performed on HC, AD, and BD groups for each canonical variant of COIs (control covariates: age and gender). If the ANOVA results show significant group difference in canonical variants, a GLM was applied to examine the effect of diagnosis on each canonical variant of COIs (control covariates: age and gender) between pairs of groups (HC vs. AD, HC vs. BD, and AD vs. BD). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Spatial maps of identified intrinsic connectivity networks \n  \nThe resulting SMs of ICNs are displayed in  . Among 100 estimated ICs, 49 of them were identified as ICNs and arranged into 8 different groups based on their anatomical and presumed functional properties: sub-cortical domain (SC), hippocampal domain (HIP), auditory domain (AUD), visual domain (VIS), sensorimotor domain (SEN), cognitive-control domain (CC), default-mode domain (DM), and cerebellar domain (CER). Our manual organization of ICNs is similar to the ordering results obtained by various empirical methods, such as spectral clustering and modularity optimization ( ;  ).   \nSpatial maps (SMs) of the 49 identified intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), arranged into eight functional domains. The number of ICNs arranged to each functional domain is provided. Each color in the SMs corresponds to a different ICN. Components labels and peak coordinates are provide in Table S1. \n  Fig. 2   \n\n\n### Feature maps of fMRI and dMRI \n  \nWe calculated FNC between ICNs as the fMRI feature and voxel-wise FA and MD maps as the dMRI features for fusion analysis. The mean FNC, mean FA and mean MD across all subjects are displayed in  . It can be observed that ICNs from the same functional domain are highly correlated with each other while ICNs from different functional domains are less correlated or even negatively correlated. We can also observe clear patterns of fiber density and myelination in WM from the FA map and the patterns of water diffusion within brain tissue from the MD map.   \nMean of functional network connectivity (FNC) feature, fractional anisotropy (FA) feature, and mean diffusivity (MD) feature across subjects. FNC is caculated by Pearson correlation coefficient between time-courses (TCs) of indepenedent components (ICs). FA and the MD maps were calculated by the DTIFIT/FSL algorithm. \n  Fig. 3   \n\n\n### Joint components of interests \n  \nThe number of components estimated using modified MDL was 26, 18, and 22 for the FNC feature, FA feature and MD feature respectively. Therefore, we chose   M   = 26 for fusion analysis. Although MCCA was conducted on the extracted features of interest, for the   M   = 26 case, a considerable amount of variance was still retained for each feature (95% for FNC, 98% for FA and 97% for MD). We aimed to investigate significant joint components of these three features and to explore whether the joint components discriminate between groups. Among the 26 derived joint components, the first ten components passed the permutation test (  p   < .05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected). After regressing out the label information from the canonical variants, we found that the correlations between the canonical variants of the first two components still pass the permutation test (  p   < .05, FDR corrected). The canonical variants of these two joint components are significantly different between groups. The canonical variants of the first component show significant differences between AD and HC (  p =   7.15 × 10 , 0.0126, 0.0282 for FNC, FA and MD respectively, FDR corrected), between AD and BD (  p =   .0215, 0.0121, 0.0089 for FNC, FA and MD respectively, FDR corrected), and between BD and HC (  p =   .0343 for MD, FDR corrected). The canonical variants of the second component show significant differences between BD and HC groups (  p =   .0204, 4.93 × 10 , 2.03 × 10  for FNC, FA and MD respectively, FDR corrected), and between AD and BD (  p =   .0071, 0.0067, 0.0022 for FNC, FA and MD respectively, FDR corrected).   displays the SMs of the first component, which were adjusted according to the box plots shown in  . The red regions/links in subplots (A) and (C) of   indicate higher values in AD than in HC/BD and the blue regions/links in subplots (B) and (C) indicate higher values in HC/BD than in AD. In subplot (D) of  , the red regions indicate a relationship that AD > HC > BD and the blue regions indicate a relationship that AD < HC < BD. Similarly,   displays the SMs of the second component, in which the red regions/links indicate higher values in BD than in HC/AD and the blue regions/links indicate higher values in HC/AD than in BD. For each component, the SMs are transformed into Z scores and visualized at a given threshold (|Z| > 2), where the highlighted regions have relatively more contribution to this component ( ;  ) and are supposed to be impaired in the patient groups if the corresponding canonical variants show significant group difference.   \nSpatial maps (SMs) of joint component 1 that are significantly group-discriminating.

For the first joint component, the AD and BD groups show changes in opposite directions (compared with the HC group, the canonical variants of the AD group increased while the canonical variants of the BD group decreased). In contrast, for the second joint component, the AD and BD groups generally have similar brain changes but with different degrees (compared with the HC group, the canonical variants of the AD and the BD groups both increased in FA and MD). As displayed in  ,  , the canonical variants of different features remain highly correlated even after regressing out group labels.   \nGroup comparisons of canonical variants of joint component 2 and correlations between canonical variants.

No area of increased FA is observed. AD has higher MD in the medial superior frontal cortex, superior temporal cortex, and temporal pole, and lower MD in the left superior frontal cortex. Interestingly, BD shows opposite MD changes in these brain regions. The observed dMRI patterns are highly correlated with changes in FNC. FNC between the cerebellum and DM and VIS domains increases in AD while FNC involving the temporal pole, thalamus and hippocampus decreases. \n\nThe SMs of the second component show that BD has higher FA in the middle cingulate cortex (MCC), PCC, precuneus, lingual gyrus and cerebral peduncles, and lower FA in anterior corona radiata, internal capsule, and posterior thalamic radiations. Moreover, the BD group has significantly increased MD in Heschl's gyrus, hippocampus, middle temporal cortex, and thalamus. These structural brain changes are associated with increased MCC/PCC related between-domains FNC and decreased MCC/PCC related within-domain FNC. Thalamus and lingual gyrus involving between-domains FNC also decreases in the BD group. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this paper, we investigated brain co-alterations from two modalities (fMRI and dMRI) across three diagnostic groups (HC, AD, and BD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to clarify AD and BD related brain changes in different MRI modalities via a functional-structural data fusion model. Note that the joint components with group-discriminating canonical variants do not mean that all regions that contribute to the component are significantly impaired. We transformed the SMs into Z scores and highlighted those regions with relatively more contribution to the components (|Z| > 2), which are more likely to be impaired in patients. We found that 1) brain changes in fMRI FNC, dMRI FA, and dMRI MD are highly correlated with each other; 2) AD and BD share both similar and different (and in some cases opposite) functional and structural brain changes. The overall results demonstrate that investigating multimodal brain imaging data through fusion analysis might help to capture more brain disorders relevant information and advance our knowledge of the relationships between functional and structural abnormalities in the brain. \n\n### Distinct functional and structural brain co-alterations in AD and BD \n  \nThe SMs of the first component displayed in   show distinct brain alteration trends between AD and BD groups. Both increased and decreased cerebellar FNC is observed in the AD group. The cerebellum is connected to many brain networks and contributes to complex brain functions, such as cognitive and sensorimotor processing ( ;  ). Previous studies have shown that the cerebellar functional connectivity is affected by dementias ( ;  ), especially AD, and such abnormalities are associated with cognitive decline ( ). However, the findings in cerebellar connectivity are inconsistent and even contradictory to some extent, since both increased and decreased cerebellum related functional connectivity have been identified in AD ( ;  ). Our current study performed ICA decomposition using a high model order which can provide more detailed functional parcellation of the brain. Both increased and decreased CER related FNC is identified in AD patients, suggesting that cerebellar connectivity might have different abnormalities and the definition of the regions of interest might be a possible source of previous disparities. The superior medial frontal gyrus also shows atypical FNC in the AD group, especially with inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), which is consistent with previous findings on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity in AD ( ;  ;  ). DLPFC is highly associated with many cognitive functions which are commonly affected in AD. The identified increased FNC within the CC domain might support the hypothesis that AD patients recruit more resources in the prefrontal cortex to compensate for cognitive function loss ( ). Decreased hippocampus FNC (e.g. FNC between hippocampus and PCC) is found in our study as well, which is also compatible with the disconnection hypothesis ( ). \n\nIdentified WM changes in the AD group are mainly located in DLPFC, temporal cortex, and corpus callosum. AD patients have significantly decreased FA in genu, body, and splenium of corpus callosum. Similar findings have been reported in previous work on AD ( ). Atypical FA in corpus callosum has been shown to be a useful measure for monitoring disease progression ( ). It is argued that axon loss in the corpus callosum, a region of usually high anisotropy, will result in a decrease in the FA of that region ( ). Wallerian degeneration of these WM fiber tracts secondary to axon loss is assumed to be a major contributing factor of WM changes in AD ( ). Our results are in line with these findings and further show that the FA changes in AD are highly associated with changes in functional brain connectivity. These associations might reveal potential relationships between WM ultrastructural damages and functional brain disconnections in dementia. \n\nIncreased MD in AD is detected in the superior medial frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus (STG) and temporal pole. MD is a common measure of translational diffusion, which increases in the presence of tissue damage ( ). MD is suggested to be a sensitive marker of neurodegeneration related to AD ( ). Previous studies have documented a wide range of increased MD in AD, especially in temporal lobes and frontal lobes ( ;  ;  ). Our results demonstrate that MD can have distinct changes in different cortical regions (both increased and decreased MD were observed in the AD group), which might underlie different tissue alterations in AD. It should be noted that the temporal and frontal cortex show both functional and structural changes in the AD patients and such co-alterations might indicate responses to brain system injury to, at least temporarily, remediate network organization to maintain task performance ( ;  ). Another interesting observation in our current study is that AD group and BD group have opposite MD changes in the temporal and frontal cortex. Such differences between AD and BD groups suggest that dysfunction in AD and BD may be caused by distinct types of WM damage. \n\n\n### Similar functional and structural brain co-alterations in AD and BD \n  \nThe results in  ,   show that AD and BD patients also share similar brain alterations, but such alterations are more severe in the BD group. FNC between DM and some sensory regions (e.g. regions within VIS and SEN) increases while FNC within DM decreases in the BD group. Since DM is anti-correlated with the sensory domains, the higher correlations represent the weaker negative FNC (closer to zero). In that case, the atypical DM FNC reveals the diminished connections with the DM in BD. DM and its functional connectivity are associated with aging and are also highly affected by AD ( ;  ;  ;  ). AD patients have been reported both decreased positive functional connectivity within DM and decreased negative functional connectivity (less negative, closer to zero) between DM and its anti-correlated networks ( ;  ). Such disconnection between DM and the other brain regions has been interpreted by decreased resting-state DM activity ( ). The identified increased PCC-MCC FA in the current study might imply decreased DM GM activations in the patients' groups. Therefore, the positive correlation between decreased DM FNC and increased DM FA extends the disconnection hypothesis ( ) by showing that functional disconnections might be mediated through WM damage. Paracentral lobule involved FNC also shows significant changes (both increased and decreased FNC with different brain regions) in the BD group. Recent research has reported increased paracentral lobule functional connectivity in AD ( ;  ). Our results highlight that distinct FNC changes in the paracentral lobule may be more associated with dementia in BD. \n\nAD and BD patients share similar structural brain changes in some other brain regions besides those DM regions (PCC-MCC and precuneus). Compared with the HCs, patients have decreased FA in anterior corona radiate, internal capsule, and posterior thalamic radiation. Decreased FA in posterior thalamic radiation has been widely reported in AD ( ;  ). Our results are in line with these previous findings and further show that BD patients have more FA changes in these brain regions, which might be associated with more severe WM damages. BD patients also show increased FA in lingual gyrus and cerebral peduncle. Lingual gyrus has been demonstrated to be highly related to age ( ) and AD ( ). The degraded linguistic abilities in some AD patients are reported, even before the onset of the disease ( ;  ). The observed atypical FA in lingual gyrus reveals that such brain damage may be common in BD patients, suggesting that BD might also result in degraded linguistic abilities. \n\nThe thalamus and middle temporal gyrus have significant increased MD, but decreased FNC between them, especially in BD patients. Increased MD indicates tissue structural damage in these regions, which might further result in alterations of structural connections between them. Previous studies have combined resting-state fMRI with dMRI to demonstrate that resting-state functional connectivity reflects a large degree of underlying structural connectivity ( ). Therefore, damage to WM might result in both changes in MD through the loss of barriers to free diffusion ( ) and changes in functional connectivity through the alterations of structural connections. AD and BD patients have increased MD in some other regions, including Heschl's gyrus and hippocampus. Hippocampus is one of the major neural structures involving episodic memory, which is severely impaired by AD and other dementias ( ;  ). The MD value of hippocampus is a sensitive measure of early degeneration in AD and it has great discriminating power between AD and normal aging ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Our current study reveals the presence of hippocampus MD alterations in both AD and BD (although it is only significant for BD), suggesting hippocampus WM changes to be a common cause of memory impairments in different types of dementia. \n\n\n\n## Potential limitations and future directions \n  \nIn this study, we used GICA and MCCA to investigate multimodal brain alterations in AD and BD. GICA and MCCA are two data-driven decomposition approaches that identify brain components based on the co-varying patterns of the brain. One limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size of the targeted groups (HC, AD, and BD). Therefore, we have taken careful steps to maximize reliability. First, we used all available subjects, including HC, AD, BD, and the other patients in the GICA. Previous studies have shown that individual subject results are well captured within GICA ( ;  ). The identified ICNs in the present studies are highly consistent with previous high-model order ICA studies ( ;  ;  ;  ), indicating that the defined components are very common and not biased by specific types of brain disorders. We also provided GICA results using only the targeted groups (61 subjects) in the supplementary materials and the overall results supported our arguments that more subjects in the GICA can provide more reliable estimates and the FNC features are not biased by the other patient groups. Second, we included all subjects with good data quality in the MCCA for capturing reliable co-varying components. We performed a permutation test for identifying the components of interesting. The results showed that, although the joint components were estimated using all available subjects, significant inter-modalities correlations were observed within the target groups, even the group labels have been regressed out (passed the permutation test, FDR corrected). These results demonstrated that identified joint components capture the real inter-subjects co-variability of the targeted subjects, which is not influenced by the group labels and the overfitting of the fusion method. Third, we regressed out age, gender, and head coil effects during the analysis to remove any potential confounding effects that might have influences on the results. We view this study as the discovery phase for potential biomarkers because all the analysis in this study can be easily implemented to compute features from new coming subjects, and this provides an attractive framework going forward for leveraging and applying the identified neuroimaging features to new data. \n\nThis manuscript is based on a dataset collected from an ongoing VCID study, in which new subjects are continuously recruited. Therefore, we would like to validate our current observations using more subjects in the future. Another limitation is our current study only focused on the statistical difference among groups. Whether such group differences are valuable biomarkers for clinical diagnosis should be considered and investigated in future studies with more subjects and greater statistical power. Patients with psychiatric diseases are used in the GICA and the fusion analysis but are not investigated through statistical analysis because of the limited number of subjects (≤ 8 after subject selections). We can extend our analysis to search for potential multimodal brain alterations for psychiatric diseases when more subjects with psychiatric diseases have been recruited. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this study, we used a multivariate method to investigate brain co-alterations in AD and BD. This is the first study to link functional and structural brain abnormalities in different types of dementia using data fusion. The results show that patients with AD and patients with BD exhibit similar brain changes in middle and posterior cingulate cortex, lingual gyrus, thalamus, thalamic radiation, Heschl's gyrus, and hippocampus, but also have distinct brain alterations in callosum, some superior frontal, and temporal regions. Our current work provides evidence of both commonalities and differences in functional brain connectivity and in WM integrity between the dementia groups, and point to the use of fusion analysis using multimodal features as a powerful tool for characterizing linked alterations in brain structure and function. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"0d8fc423db0f594434970a061bbb14ae"},

Here we assessed the pathological functional organization that may underlie the behavioral impairments in NF1 using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Coherent spontaneous fluctuations in the fMRI signal across the entire brain were used to interrogate the pattern of functional organization of corticocortical and corticostriatal networks in both NF1 pediatric patients and mice with a heterozygous mutation in the   Nf1   gene (  Nf1  ). Children with NF1 demonstrated abnormal organization of cortical association networks and altered posterior-anterior functional connectivity in the default network. Examining the contribution of the striatum revealed that corticostriatal functional connectivity was altered. NF1 children demonstrated reduced functional connectivity between striatum and the frontoparietal network and increased striatal functional connectivity with the limbic network. Awake passive mouse functional connectivity MRI in   Nf1   mice similarly revealed reduced posterior-anterior connectivity along the cingulate cortex as well as disrupted corticostriatal connectivity. The striatum of   Nf1   mice showed increased functional connectivity to somatomotor and frontal cortices and decreased functional connectivity to the auditory cortex. Collectively, these results demonstrate similar alterations across species, suggesting that NF1 pathogenesis is linked to striatal dysfunction and disrupted corticocortical connectivity in the default network. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal-dominant tumor pre-disposition syndrome, mostly known for the tendency to develop benign nerve sheath tumors. Beyond the oncological aspect of the disease, hyper-activation of the Ras pathway in NF1 results in several pathologies, both in and outside the CNS ( ). Individuals with NF1, especially at a young age (< 21 years), display micro- and macroscopic abnormalities in the central nervous system, and a unique profile of neuropsychological cognitive deficiencies ( ;  ). As attention deficit and learning disabilities are a hallmark of NF1-associated cognitive dys-function, animal models of NF1 are potentially valuable for clinical research of these phenotypes. \n\nAmong the pathology seen in the NF1 brain are foci of impaired myelination that are associated with cognitive impairment when strategically located ( ;  ). Studies in NF1 genetically engineered mouse models revealed neurotransmitter imbalance and impaired long-term potentiation, which were also reported in humans ( ;  ;  ;  ). These impairments may underlie NF1-associated behavioral changes that include attention deficits, learning disabilities, hyperactivity, lower IQ, and impaired spatial perception. \n\nThe basal ganglia have been implicated in gross phenotypic disruption seen in NF1 pediatric patients and mouse models. Neurofibromin, the protein coded by the   Nf1   gene, has been implicated in regulation of prefrontal and striatal inhibitory networks through increased GABA release ( ), and motor impairments and structural changes in the striatum measured with MRI have been reported in NF1 mouse models, suggesting a critical role for this region ( ;  ;  ). Reduction in striatal dopamine levels has been reported, lending further support for a striatal role in NF1 deficits ( ). In humans, subtle alterations in structure and function of the basal ganglia were found using histological ( ), biochemical ( ), and morphological ( ) analyses. Functionally, hypoactivation of frontostriatal circuits was described during working memory related tasks in NF1 patients ( ). Nevertheless, the impact of neurofibromin deficiency on gross functional organization of brain networks and corticostriatal connectivity remains unclear. \n\nHere we sought to assess the disruption resulting from neurofibromin deficiency using functional imaging, aiming to understand the functional and organizational alterations associated with NF1-specific etiologies. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) is a noninvasive imaging approach that allows investigation of functional organization of brain networks via coherent spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal. Used in humans ( ;  ) and rodents ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) to study brain organization in health and disease, fcMRI enables direct cross-species comparison ( ;  ) and provides a path to characterize disease pathogenesis. Leveraging these strengths, we used fcMRI to examine cortical functional organization and corticostriatal connectivity in children with NF1 and in a mouse model of this condition. After we identified abnormal functional connectivity in the pediatric participants, we sought to determine whether these findings are recapitulated in   Nf1   mice using fcMRI in awake passive mice. We found striking similarity of altered corticocortical and corticostriatal functional connectivity recapitulating the disrupted organization found in pediatric participants. \n\n\n## Materials & methods \n  \n### Ethics statement \n  \nThe study was approved by the institutional review board of Children’s National Health System. Prior to participation, written assent and consent were obtained from children and their parents/legal guardian respectively, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the United States Public Health Service’s Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. \n\n\n### Human participants \n  \nFourteen children with NF1 (age 9.1 ± 2 years; range 7–14; 5 females) were included in this study. All NF1 participants were diagnosed according to the 1987 National Institutes of Health criteria. NF1 participants were scanned at Children’s National Health System on a General Electric whole-body 3 Tesla MR scanner (MR750, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). For each participant one or two 6 min BOLD T * weighted gradient echo-echo planar imaging protocol (GEEPI; repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE] 2500/25 ms, flip angle [FA] = 90°, 38 slices, matrix 64 × 64, FOV 240 × 240 mm ,3.75 × 3.75 × 3.3 mm  voxels) was acquired, in addition to a high resolution anatomical T  weighted scan used for registration (TR/TE8.2/3.2 ms; FA = 12°, matrix 256 × 256, FOV 256 × 256 mm , effective resolution of 1 × 1 × 1 mm  voxels). For comparison with healthy subjects, we used healthy participants from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, which is a repository of resting-state fMRI and structural scans of children with or without autism ( ). Data of typically developing children (TDC) from eight centers (NYU, YALE, KKI, STANFORD, UCLA, OLIN, LEUVEN, TRINITY) were used. NF1 participants are compared to TDC scanned elsewhere requiring proper control groups. To validate differences reported here between NF1 and TDC do not stem from differences in head motion, which is a known confound for functional connectivity measures ( ;  ) or different imaging parameters, we included two control groups that were both matched to our NF1 group in terms of age and sex. The first group was matched for head motion (TDC1) and the second was matched for scan parameters (TDC2) to control for these possible confounds (see  ). \n\n\n### Human data preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing followed standard procedures ( ) and motion artifacts were minimized using data scrubbing ( ;  ). Exclusion criteria included framewise displacement exceeding 0.5 mm, temporal derivative RMS variance over voxels (DVARS) exceeding 0.5%, absolute translation over 2 mm or absolute rotation of 0.05°, and exclusion of 1 frame before and two after the detected motion. Five NF1 patients were excluded from this study due to low SNR, excessive movement, or anatomical abnormalities. Whole brain signal, white matter, and ventricle signals were regressed out to minimize signal from non-neural sources, followed by low-pass temporal filtering. Next, data were processed in two parallel pipelines:volume and surface. Volume normalization followed previous procedures ( ) to linearly transform functional images to a downsampled version of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template at 2 × 2 × 2 mm . Surface normalization followed   Briefly, structural data was preprocessed using FreeSurfer 4.5.0 ( ). This pipeline constitutes a suite of algorithms that reconstruct a surface representation of the cortical ribbon from an individual participant’s anatomical scan. Group analysis was done through the common spherical coordinate system for both structural and functional data and a 6 mm full width at half-maximum (FWHM) smoothing kernel was applied to the functional data. \n\n\n### Animal functional imaging procedures \n  \nEleven wild-type (WT; C57BL/6) and eleven NF1 (  Nf1  ) male animals were included. As previously described ( ), mice were implanted with MRI-compatible headposts at age 2–3 months, acclimatized to prolonged head-fixation inside the MRI scanner, and underwent awake head-fixed fcMRI scanning. MRI scans were performed at 9.4 Tesla MRI (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) using a quadrature 86 mm transmit-only coil and a 20 mm loop receive-only coil (Bruker). On each scanning session, fast anatomical images were acquired using a rapid acquisition process with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence in coronal orientations (TR/TE 2300/8.5 ms, FA = 180°, RARE factor = 4, 30 coronal slices, matrix 128 × 128, FOV 19.2 × 19.2 mm , 150 × 150 × 450 μm ). Whole-brain BOLD functional imaging was achieved using spin echo-echo planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence (TR/TE 2500/18.398 ms, FA = 180°, 30 coronal slices, matrix 96 × 64, FOV 14.4 × 9.6 mm ,150 × 150 × 450 μm  voxels; the imaged volume was framed with four saturation slices to avoid wraparound artifacts). Two hundred repetitions were acquired on each run, and four runs were acquired per session. Each animal was scanned over 5–8 sessions (WT: 5.91 ± 0.83; NF1: 5.73 ± 0.467) over a period of 5 to 24 days (WT: 12.27 ± 4.9; NF1: 12.56 ± 4.08;   t   = 0.141,   p   = .888). A minimum of zero and a maximum of three scanning sessions were excluded for each animal due to excessive motion (see below for details). A two-tailed unpaired   t  -test did not reveal reliable differences in the number of included sessions per animal (WT: 4.82 ± 0.982; NF1: 5 ± 0.89,   t   = 0.454,  p   = .655), number of included frames per animal (WT: 2448.46 ± 657.217; NF: 2350.46 ± 472.636,   t   = 0.402,   p   = .692) or average head motion measured using framewise displacement (WT:48.3 ± 7.02 μm; NF: 51.4 ± 6.4 μm,   t   = 1.075,   p   = .295), indicating that the groups were well-matched. \n\n\n### Mouse data preprocessing \n  \nRaw data were reconstructed using ParaVision 5.1 (Bruker). Standard mouse fMRI preprocessing was based on previous work ( ;  ), and included removal of the first two volumes for T -equilibration effects, compensation of slice-dependent time shifts, rigid body correction for motion within and across runs, registration to a downsampled version (150 × 150 × 450 μm ) of the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity (AMBC) Atlas which includes anatomical annotations ( ) and optical density maps from anatomical tracing experiments ( ), and intensity normalization. \n\nPreprocessed data were then passed for additional fcMRI-specific processing steps. A data scrubbing protocol was applied to eliminate motion-related artifacts ( ;  ). Exclusion criteria were framewise displacement of 50 μm and DVARS of 150% inter-quartile range (IQR) above the 75th percentile, with exclusion of 1 additional frame after the detected motion. Runs with fewer than 50 frames and sessions with fewer than 300 frames were excluded. A total of 20 out of 128 sessions were excluded (WT = 12/65; NF1 = 8/63). Next, data underwent demeaning, detrending and regression of sources of spurious or regionally nonspecific variance including six motion parameters, average time courses in the ventricles and global signal, with temporally shifted versions of these waveforms removed by inclusion of their first temporal derivatives. Temporal filtering was used to retain frequencies between 0.009 and 0.08 Hz and data were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with FWHM of 600 μm. \n\n\n### Experimental design and statistical analysis \n  \n#### Human data analysis \n  \nFor each group of participants, we used a global similarity-based clustering approach to parcellate the cortex into seven networks ( ). The Sørensen–Dice index (also termed   similarity coefficient  ), calculated as   D   = 2 × (A ∩ B)/(|A| + |B|), was used to quantify the overlap between NF1 (A) and TDC (B) cortical parcellation, where a similarity coefficient of 1 (  D  ) represents a perfect overlap. A complementary seed-based analysis was conducted using a ~40 mm  sphere located in the posterior cingulate cortex in which seed-based Fisher’s Z transformed   r   correlation maps submitted to a one-way   t  -tests (SPM, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). In addition, seed-to-seed analysis examined the connectivity between the posterior and anterior cingulate cortex. A similar seed-to-seed approach was used to characterize corticostriatal connectivity by calculating the Z transformed   r   correlation between striatal seeds (in volume space) and cortical seeds (in surface space), as previously described ( ). \n\n\n#### Mouse data analysis \n  \nTo estimate functional connectivity in the mouse brain, 450 μm-diameter spheres (5 voxels) were placed at the center of the relevant AMBC tracing experiments to define regions-of-interest (ROIs), as previously described ( ). In each mouse, seed-based Fisher’s Z transformed   r   correlation maps were averaged across sessions, and the averaged maps were submitted to a one-way   t  -test (SPM). These maps were used to characterize functional connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex. In addition, a seed-to-seed analysis was used to formally test changes in posterior-anterior connectivity along the cingulate cortex and to characterize corticostriatal connectivity. Striatal seeds were defined based on anatomical connectivity profiles from the AMBC Atlas, as previously described ( ;  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe first explored the impact of neurofibromin deficiency on brain-wide functional organization in pediatric participants. For this we utilized a dataset of children with NF1 and two age- and gender-matched comparison groups of typically developing children (TDC). We addressed two potential confounds that might mask veridical differences linked to NF1: participant head motion (TDC1) and scan parameters (TDC2). \n\n### Organization of brain-wide functional connectivity in NF1 children \n  \nTo examine the brain-wide organization, we utilized a global similarity-based clustering parcellation. In both comparison groups parcellation to seven networks yielded Default, Visual, Frontoparietal, Limbic and Dorsal Attention (DA) networks that were similar to those in adults ( ). The Somatomotor (SM) and Ventral Attention (VA) parcellations differed relative to adults, not showing the formation of the typical interdigitated, distributed areas that form the VA and the contiguous post- and pre-central sulcus parcel that is observed in adults ( ). In the NF1 group, the same, immature, parcellation pattern of the SM and VA was evident, as well as the typical formation of the visual network. However, the NF1 group failed to demonstrate the proper organization of other association networks including Default,Frontoparietal, DA, and Limbic ( ). Quantitative comparison of network overlap between the two control groups revealed close agreement with a median Dice index of 0.87 (range 0.75 – 0.96) in both the right and left hemispheres ( ). Examining network overlap between NF1 and TDC groups revealed lower similarity coefficients for Default, Frontoparietal, DA, and Limbic networks, all networks that are usually characterized by patterns of distal connectivity, while VA, SM and Visual networks had similarity coefficients > 0.75 ( ). In these latter networks, distal connectivity is weaker relative to local connectivity ( ). Further, examination of the spatial extent of Default and Frontoparietal networks revealed that while their parcellations differ, when considered together they demonstrate fair overlap ( ). Importantly, the high similarity of these networks in the two independent TDC groups suggests that network changes seen in the NF1 group are independent of head motion or imaging parameters. Collectively, these findings indicate disrupted functional connectivity in association networks in NF1 children. \n\nTo better characterize the Default network, we used a seed-based functional connectivity analysis in the posterior cingulate cortex ( ). The results confirm the global similarity clustering findings with the NF1 group showing reduced posterior-anterior connectivity along the cingulate cortex. To formally test whether the reduced connectivity is associated with physical distance, we placed four seeds along the anterior cingulate cortex, and calculated their correlation with the posterior cingulate seed ( ). Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of Group (F  = 4.71,   p   = .039) as well as a significant interaction between Group and Longitudinal Axis (F  = 3.72,   p   = .028, ε  = 0.717), confirming distance-dependent reduced connectivity in the NF1 group. \n\n\n### Corticostriatal connectivity and topographic striatal organization are altered in NF1 \n  \nSince the most dramatic corticocortical changes were observed in association networks, we focused our investigation of corticostriatal connectivity in these cortical systems. To investigate corticostriatal connectivity patterns, we replicated a seed-to-seed analysis from  . The analysis is based on 16 cortical seeds located in different association systems and three striatal seeds that are known to be connected to the Default, Frontoparietal, and Limbic networks ( ). Examining the connectivity profile of each of the striatal seeds ( ), we found that overall, the TDC1 group shows similar patterns to the original analysis in adults ( , cf. Fig. 12), with some differences in the Default region of the striatum which failed to demonstrate the mature connectivity profile. Comparing the results to the NF1 group, we found that NF1 children show decreased corticostriatal connectivity in the cortical regions of the Frontoparietal (PFCmp, PFCla, PGa) and Default (PFCdp, PFCm, PGc, PCC) networks, as well as increased connectivity with the Limbic subgenual cingulate cortex (scg25). To formally test the topography of corticostriatal connections and to compare between groups we focused on the Default, Frontoparietal and Limbic cortices, and averaged the corticostriatal connectivity of all seeds that belong to the same network based on the definition in adults ( ); then, we submitted the results to a repeated-measure ANOVA. First, we found a significant interaction between Striatal Seed and Cortical Network (F  = 21.09,   p   < .001,ε  = 0.745), confirming topographical organization of different cortical networks within the striatum. Next, we found a significant interaction between Cortical Network and Group (F  = 6.67,   p   = .008,ε  = 0.764) but not a three-way interaction between Striatal Seed, Cortical Network and Group (F  = 0.94,   p   = .43, ε  = 0.745), indicating alterations that do not change the topography of corticostriatal connectivity. To break down the interaction between Cortical Network and Group, we conducted similar analysis for each pair of networks using Bonferroni adjusted alpha levels of 0.0167 per test(0.05/3). We found significant interaction when comparing Limbic and Frontoparietal networks (F(1,26) = 8.59,   p   = .0077, ε  = 1), with no interactions between these and the Default network (Default vs. Limbic: F  = 5.74,   p   = .024, ε  = 1; Default vs. Frontoparietal: F (1,26) = 2.2,   p   = .15, ε  = 1). Collectively, these results indicate increased limbic and decreased frontoparietal corticostriatal connectivity in NF1 pediatric patients. \n\n\n### NF1 mice demonstrate altered posterior–anterior connectivity along the cingulate cortex \n  \nNext, we examined whether the altered functional organization we found in NF1 pediatric participants is recapitulated in an NF1 mouse model. Since the global similarity clustering algorithm has yet to bet adapted to mice, we focused on the disrupted posterior–anterior connectivity, which was previously reported in rodents, and considered homologous ( ;  ). Seed-based functional connectivity analysis of the retrosplenial cortex showed that NF1 mice fail to demonstrate posterior-anterior connectivity ( ). To formally test this observation, we used seed-to-seed analysis between the retrosplenial cortex and four seeds along the anterior cingulate area ( ). The connectivity profiles were submitted to a repeated-measures ANOVA, which revealed a significant main effect of Group (F  = 6.1,   p   = .023) as well as a significant interaction between Group and Longitudinal Axis (F  = 3.53,   p   = .036, ε  = 0.711) indicating distance-dependent reduced connectivity in the NF1 group, recapitulating the human phenotype. \n\n\n### NF1 mice demonstrate disrupted cortcostriatal connectivity \n  \nAfter we found similar alteration in corticocortical connectivity, we sought to examine whether NF1 mice recapitulate the disrupted cortcostriatal connectivity we found in humans. Unlike the mammalian cerebral cortex, which underwent dramatic expansion and elaboration ( ), the striatum has remained relatively conserved ( ), allowing a more straightforward comparison across species. Therefore, we hypothesized that NF1 mice will demonstrated altered organization similar to that seen in humans. A recent study ( ) investigated corticostriatal connectivity in the mouse brain by comparing fcMRI data to anatomical tracing data from the AMBC Atlas. This study reported a close agreement between anatomical and functional corticostriatal connectivity, as both modalities demonstrated a similar topographical organization of auditory, somatomotor and frontal cortices along the longitudinal axis of the mouse striatum. Therefore, we took a similar approach and used the AMBC Atlas to guide our seed-based analysis. \n\nBased on the reorganization of the human NF1 striatum, we hypothesized that corticostriatal functional connectivity in NF1 mice would be altered. To test this hypothesis, we placed seeds in 16 cortical regions. Representative anatomical and functional maps for the ventral auditory, secondary somatosensory, primary motor and anterior cingulate cortices demonstrated close agreement between anatomical and functional connections in both WT and NF1 mice ( ), as functional connectivity maps generally captured inter-hemispheric corticocortical and both inter- and intra-hemispheric corticostriatal functional connectivity. \n\nTo better characterize the organization of corticostriatal functional connectivity in WT and NF1 mice, we used the anatomical connectivity data from the AMBC Atlas to define seeds in three striatal subregions ( ), which are known to be connected to frontal, somatomotor and auditory cortices, respectively. We assigned our 16 ROIs to five cortical systems: frontal, somatomotor, auditory, parietal association, and visual (  )  , and calculated the connectivity profiles of the different striatal subregions ( ). We found that overall the WT group show distinct topography with different cortical seeds peaks at different striatal subregions, as previously reported ( ). Comparing the results to the NF1 group, we found that NF1 mice show decreased corticostriatal connectivity in the auditory cortices (AUDd, AUDp, AUDv) and increased connectivity with the prefrontal cortices (ACA, ORBm, PL), as well as some somatomotor cortices (SSpbfd, SSs). To formally test the topography of corticostriatal connections and to compare between groups we focused on frontal, somatomotor and auditory cortices, and averaged the corticostriatal connectivity of all seeds that belong to the same network ( ); then, we submitted the results to a repeated-measure ANOVA. First, we found a significant interaction between Striatal Seed and Cortical Network (F  = 41.94,   p   < .001, ε  = 1), confirming topographical organization of different cortical networks within the striatum. Next, we found a significant interaction between Cortical Network and Group (F  = 12.74,   p   ≤ .001, ε  = 0.816) and three-way interaction between Striatal Seed, Cortical Network and Group (F  = 3.17,  p   = .018, ε  = 1), indicating altered corticostriatal connectivity in NF1 mice that affect the topographical organization. To break down the interaction between Cortical Network and Group, we conducted similar analysis for each pair of networks using Bonferroni adjusted alpha levels of 0.0167 per test (0.05/3). We found significant interactions between Auditory and both Frontal (F  = 26.56,   p   < .001, ε  = 1) and Somatomotor (F  = 11.19,   p   = .003, ε  = 1) networks, with no interaction between Frontal and Somatomotor (F  = 0.12,  p   = .737, ε  = 1). Collectively, these results indicate decreased auditory and increased somatomotor and frontal corticostriatal connectivity in NF1 mice, demonstrating similar phenotype across species. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere, we report a cross-species comparative analysis of the functional organization of the NF1 brain in both humans and mice. In typically developing children, we characterized the organization of large-scale cortical functional networks and formation of corticostriatal functional connectivity in this age group for the first time and identified alterations in functional organization associated with NF1. We then applied the same functional imaging method in a mouse model of NF1 and found similar alterations in corticocortical and corticostriatal connectivity. \n\nHyper-activation of the Ras pathway results in several pathophysiological alterations that may lead to the typical NF1 cognitive phenotype. We discovered two fundamental disruptions that may be explained by cellular defects known to result from neurofibromin deficiency. First, we identified that the development of large-scale association networks, the default and frontoparietal, differs in NF1 relative to healthy participants, and that this pattern is associated more broadly with disrupted posterior-anterior functional connectivity in the cingulate cortex. This disruption was replicated in the mouse data and may be explained by aberrant myelination known to occur in both NF1 mouse models and pediatric patients. Second, we demonstrated altered organization of corticostriatal functional connectivity in humans and mice, as both species showed differential modulations of distinct cortical networks. This is among few demonstrations of a common pathological functional organization in humans and a genetic mouse model of the human condition. These data highlight the importance of neurofibromin signaling in the establishment of cortical association and corticostriatal networks. \n\nAnalysis of cortical functional organization in typically developing children revealed nascent immature organization of the somatomotor and ventral attention cortical networks. In adults the somatomotor network covers the entire primary motor and somatosensory cortices, extends ventrally to the insular area, and includes parts of the auditory cortex, while the ventral attention network is dispersed, and includes the inferior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus (posterior part), and mesially the cingulate gyrus ( ). Here, typically developing children demonstrated conserved division into networks when these were estimated using the same global similarity-based clustering parcellation ( ) with the exception that the somatomotor and ventral attention networks were divided into dorsal and ventral components. This result was similar in both comparison groups with high inter-group overlap of both components. This finding of immature organization of the somatomotor and ventral attention networks in healthy children is compatible with current concepts of the formation of distinct, dispersed, functional connectivity networks with age.   analyzed a cohort of 100 participants aged 13–30 and reported a decrease in between-network functional connectivity and an increase in within-network functional connectivity that correlated with age, consistent with current descriptions of age-related differences ( ). This nascent parcellation of networks was recapitulated in the NF1 group, demonstrating age-appropriate organization of these networks, as well as the mature organization of the visual and network in both healthy and NF1 participants. \n\nLong-range functional connectivity and distributed functional networks are known to develop slowly in parallel with the formation of myelin from childhood to adulthood ( ). Impairment in the typical maturation process was recently suggested in NF1.   reported impairment in posterior-anterior functional connectivity and suggested that it was related to malformation of association networks in NF1 adults. This finding was replicated in our study in a cohort of NF1 pediatric patients in two independent analyses. First, unlike in TDC, the NF1 group failed to demonstrate the formation of age-appropriate association networks that are based on posterior-anterior functional connectivity (dorsal attention, frontoparietal, limbic and default). Further, a seed-based cortical functional connectivity analysis demonstrated weaker correlations of default network regions in NF1. The latter analysis was replicated in NF1 mice, which also demonstrated disrupted posterior-anterior connectivity along the cingulate cortex. This disruption in the formation of long-range connectivity may be related to disruptions in myelination, which is essential for structural maturation of the human brain ( ), since the   Nf1   gene has been implicated in white matter defects including myelin decompaction ( ;  ;  ). In direct relation to these microscopic alterations, studies in human NF1 patients demonstrated broadly abnormal myelination, particularly in the frontal lobe, expressed as significantly decreased radial diffusivity measured with diffusion weighted imaging ( ). These findings suggest that the reduced long-range functional connectivity of the dorsal attention, frontoparietal, limbic and default networks observed here might be related to disruption in myelination. \n\nOne of the limitations of the current study is that mice and human are not in the same developmental stage. While in humans we characterized functional connectivity in pediatric participants, the mouse data were acquired in adult animals due to technical limitations of the head fixation and acclimatization process for awake imaging. Therefore, it is possible that the developmental trajectory of functional organization, such as age-dependent changes, reported in other mouse models of autism ( ) differs across the species. However, the close agreement between the corticocortical analysis here and previous findings in adults ( ) suggests that at least these NF1-related alterations are not age-specific and can be compared between the mouse and human datasets. Moreover, our results are in close agreement with other studies that linked reduced posterior-anterior connectivity in the Default network and neurodevelopmental disorders in humans and mice ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Finally, posterior-anterior connectivity along the cingulate cortex is clinically relevant, as in human ASD patients ( ;  ), and a mouse model of autism ( ) it was found to be inversely correlated with deficits in social behavior. Future studies should compare behavioral and neuroimaging data in NF1 to examine whether it is also characterized by similar correlations. \n\nThe striatum has been implicated in the NF1 cognitive phenotype in NF1 mouse models and human patients ( ;  ;  ;  ). We sought to characterize whether corticostriatal functional connectivity was altered in NF1. An in-depth mapping of striatal functional connectivity in TDC relative to adults revealed that maturation was correlated with a developmental shift from preferential functional connectivity of the basal ganglia and the somatomotor network in childhood, to the frontoparietal and ventral attention association networks in adulthood ( ). In our study, while typically developing children displayed mature and balanced connectivity profiles in limbic and frontoparietal striatal regions, the NF1 group showed increased limbic and decreased frontoparietal connectivity. This finding is consistent with a previous work ( ) that implicated pre-frontal and striatal functional connectivity in working memory impairment in adults with NF1, linking functional and behavioral measures. \n\nSimilar to our findings in humans,   Nf1   mice demonstrated an overall conserved topographic functional organization frontal and somatomotor striatal region, with markedly altered topography in the auditory striatum. In addition, NF1 mice showed increased somato-motor and frontal with decreased auditory corticostriatal connectivity. The fact that both children and mice show differential alterations in corticostriatal connectivity suggests that mesoscopic phenotype found in both species may be used to dissect the mechanisms governing these disruptions. This result suggests that therapies that reduce increased corticostriatal functional connectivity may be beneficial in alleviating the NF1 cognitive phenotype. Further, longitudinal pre-clinical functional imaging, which is possible in awake mouse fMRI ( ), will complement demonstrations of mapping ( ;  ) and changes in brain-wide functional connectivity in models of disease ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThe human striatum demonstrates a consistent, topographically arranged, functional connectivity pattern ( ;  ). Alterations in the functional organization of the basal ganglia were reported in both ASD and ADHD. A study comparing ASD patients with a typically developing matched cohort found that the ASD group failed to demonstrate the age associated reduction in functional connectivity between the putamen and the frontal pole ( ). In a study focusing on adolescents with ADHD, increased correlation of the putamen and ventral striatum with several cortical areas including motor and prefrontal cortices was shown ( ). In contrast,   reported that reduced connectivity between the dorsal caudate and prefrontal cortex was correlated with attentional performance in the control and ADHD groups and reduced connectivity between ventral caudate and inferior frontal cortices predicted clinical response to methylphenidate. Several studies of mouse models of ASD reported altered corticostriatal connectivity ( ;  ;  ;  ), and in a study on the 16p11.2 microdeletion model of autism, impaired prefrontal functional connectivity was demonstrated ( ). As many as 40% of NF1 patients display ASD symptomatology ( ), and 60–70% display the ADHD pheno-type ( ). Our findings of altered corticostriatal and decreased long-range corticocortical functional connectivity, with a possible key role for myelin dysfunction ( ;  ;  ), suggest a potential common disruption pathway pivotal for this phenotype in both NF1 and ASD. These findings warrant further investigation at the individual participant level by clinically and dimensionally assessing ASD and ADHD phenotypes in NF1 patients. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"6e9ec84b30d353505fbbaef07126ec42"},

This view implies a continuum of shared neural alterations along the psychotic disorder spectrum. In particular, bipolar disorder (BD) patients were recently documented to have an altered LN asymmetry during resting state. The extent to which the LN architecture is altered and stable also during a language task has yet to be investigated. To address this question, we analyzed fMRI data recorded during an open-eyes resting state session and a silent verbal fluency task in 16 euthymic BD patients and 16 matched healthy controls (HC). Functional connectivity in the LN of both groups was computed using spatial independent component analysis, and group comparisons were carried out to assess the network organization during both rest and active linguistic task conditions. The LN of BD patients involved left and right brain areas during both resting state and linguistic task. Compared to the left-lateralized network found in HC, the BD group was characterized by two anterior clusters (in left frontal and right temporo-insular regions) and the disengagement of the posterior language areas, especially during the verbal fluency task. Our findings support the hypothesis that reduced language lateralization may represent a biological marker across different psychotic disorders and that the altered language network connectivity found at rest in bipolar patients is stable and pervasive as it is also impaired during a verbal fluency task. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nOver the last few years, the study of brain networks with neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has provided a deeper understanding of the neural substrates of cognitive functions [ ]. This functional architecture of the brain has been explored in terms of both task-related and spontaneous activity [ , ]. Indeed, while several functional studies focused on brain responses elicited by specific stimuli or tasks, a large body of literature also reported coherent spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity, even in the absence of any external stimulation [ ]. In particular, a growing number of studies focused on the identification of the relationship between this intrinsic network organization, as measured during resting state condition, and the one supporting active task. Notably, a series of contributions showed a relationship between resting state functional connectivity (FC) and task-evoked activations (e.g., [ , , ]). For example, Tavor and colleagues used task-free acquisitions to predict task-evoked responses, including a large set of behavioral paradigms [ ]. The results showed that task-free acquisitions were the best predictor of individual task-evoked activity across all tasks. Similarly, Cole et al. observed a significant statistical relationship between resting state and task-evoked FC, suggesting that large-scale intrinsic networks can shape specific activations during task [ ]. \n\nStudies on the correspondence between task-dependent and task-free network topology in psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder (BD) are relatively scarce. Investigations in this direction might provide a link between a theoretical perspective (i.e., psychosis viewed as a continuum) and the future development of neurolinguistic markers of BD of clinical interest. BD is a psychiatric condition responsible for dysfunctional mood state, cognition, and emotional regulation [ , ]. It is characterized by a cyclical switch from depression to mania (BD-I) or hypomania (BD-II) [ , ]. During only the euthymic phase, BD patients do not exhibit significant clinical symptoms, although mood vulnerability is still present [ ]. Network alterations in BD patients were widely documented during both task and rest conditions (for a review, see [ ]). In particular, several experimental paradigms, such as executive function and working memory tasks, have been used to study network organization in BD patients and control adults [ , , , , , , , , , ]. Most of these studies reported BD alterations during both executive function and working memory tasks in the prefrontal areas and the dorsolateral regions in particular. Changes were also found in other regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex, frontopolar cortex, and parietal and ventral prefrontal cortices [ , , ]. Notably, this large heterogeneity could be explained by differences in the experimental setup and task, the patients’ inclusion criteria, the implemented analysis, and the absence of control for confounding variables (e.g., the effects of medication). Concerning resting state studies, alterations were also found within different brain networks, including the default mode network (DMN), fronto-parietal network, salience network, central executive network, and language network (LN) [ , , , , , , , ], as well as in the functional connectivity between the cerebellum and temporal lobe regions of interests of lifetime hallucinating BD patients [ ]. These differences either in network topology [ ] or oscillatory activity [ ] for the LN and the DMN, respectively, also emerged when considering BD patients in their euthymic phase. Interestingly, a relationship between network alterations and clinical scores, including maniac and depressive symptoms, was reported for both networks. This suggested that a psychobiological trace of BD patients’ vulnerability is still present in specific networks, such as DMN and LN, when frank symptomatology is also almost absent. Overall, the network approach provided useful markers for neurological and psychiatric disorders [ , , , ], offering great potential for diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. Concerning BD, many studies investigated the presence of abnormalities in specific networks at rest or in response to a task and their correlations with clinical scales [ , , , ]. \n\nA recent study on euthymic BD patients showed alterations in the spatial organization of the LN, which, together with the typical left-lateralized area (i.e., the middle temporal gyrus), also included the right homologous regions (i.e., Broca and anterior insula) [ ]. Indeed, for this network, BD patients recruited both left and right temporal areas. This finding is in line with Crow’s theory on the role of altered language lateralization at the origin of schizophrenia [ , ] and, more generally, functional psychoses [ ]. Notably, Crow’s theory accounts for most of the psychotic symptoms, including delusions, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorders, all arising from the activation of two “uncertain” hemispheres. In this perspective, this model is easy to test, for example, by simply measuring hemispheric specialization for language. Beyond Crow’s original theory, considering that language lateralization is a   crystallized   characteristic of the human brain networking—acquired during childhood but persists for the rest of the individual’s life—a failure in this hemispheric specialization could represent a possible marker of mental disease, regardless of the current state of the patient. In other words, as language probably represents the most complex emerging property of a large and complex brain, any disorder that affects the delicate architecture and connectivity between and within hemispheres can, in principle, alter this equilibrium, thus explaining most of the symptoms and metalinguistic impairments which characterize the most severe psychiatric disorders (e.g., semantic anomalies, thought disorders, ruminations, and auditory hallucinations). Interestingly, structural and functional abnormalities in regions that are part of the language circuitry were reported, at the hemodynamic and electrophysiological level, both in schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations [ , , , ], individuals with clinical high-risk psychosis [ ], and bipolar [ ] and major depressive (MDD) patients [ ]. This evidence supports not only Crow’s original theory but also another recent model associated with functional psychoses, i.e., the continuum hypothesis of shared neural alterations in the psychotic spectrum disorders, including all these mental conditions characterized by an important difficulty in distinguishing what is real from what is not [ ]. By studying the changes in the brain network organization (e.g., the recruitment of different brain regions), we could investigate the differences between intrinsic resting-related and task-evoked activity and their implications for the behavior. In particular, the focus on brain network reconfiguration from rest to task may reveal new insights into neural dysfunctions in the psychopathology of specific disorders. Indeed, as previously proposed, it is not clear whether FC abnormalities at rest could be associated with a similar abnormal response during active tasks [ , ]. Therefore, the execution of a task could allow probing the integrity of inter- and intra-hemispheric networks and processes within a specific cognitive domain. \n\nIn this present study, our goal was to investigate the influence of an engaging task on LN intrinsic organization. To this end, we aimed to analyze whether LN functional connectivity in euthymic BD patients is altered not only during resting state conditions but also when an active language task is performed. In particular, our hypothesis was that the euthymic condition is associated with functional abnormalities in a specific network (i.e., LN) not only during a resting state but also during a language-inducing task execution [ , ]. We tested this hypothesis on 16 BD patients in the euthymic phase and 16 healthy controls. In particular, we analyzed fMRI data recorded during an open-eyes resting state session and during a silent verbal fluency task, in which participants were asked to produce as many words as possible starting from a given letter. Our experimental design was oriented (i) to investigate the spontaneous organization of LN in both BD patients and healthy controls and (ii) to assess how the architecture of this network changes during a task involving language pathways. According to Crow’s theory [ , , , ] on psychosis origin and considering past results from a variety of clinical/subclinical samples (i.e., individuals with clinical high-risk for psychosis [ ], BD [ ], and MDD patients [ ]), we expected that euthymic BD patients, despite their relatively stable condition, would recruit bilateral fronto-temporal LN areas during both rest and task conditions; in addition, we expected an enhanced effect of the task compared to the rest condition on the ability to ignite dysfunctional right homologous regions. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nSixteen euthymic BD patients (10 females, average age = 53.25 years, Standard Deviation [SD] = ±11.46 years) were recruited at the Mood Disorders Outpatient Unit of the Padova University Hospital and took part in this study. Patients were recruited according to the following inclusion criteria: (a) they received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (type I or II) for at least one year; (b) they were non-remitting outpatients; (c) they were in a euthymic state at the moment of the experimental data collection (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] scores being lower than 8) [ ]. Details about anamnestic and clinical data of BD patients are summarized in  . These patients represent a subgroup of the bipolar population investigated in previous works from our research group [ , ]. Sixteen healthy, age-matched, controls (HC) were also included in this study (average group means ± SD in  ). \n\nWe only recruited healthy participants, not reporting kinship with some members of the patient group, use of psychotropic drugs, and major lifetime psychiatric diagnosis. All participants, both BD patients and HCs, were suitable for MRI scanning and did not suffer from epilepsy or any other major neurologic brain comorbidities. This present study adheres to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Padua University Hospital. The informed written consent was signed by all participants before they started the experiment. \n\n\n### 2.2. Clinical Assessment \n  \nAll participants completed a psychiatric interview (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) before the MRI session with a board-certified psychiatrist to assess the presence or absence of current and past psychiatric illness. On the day of the experiment, a psychiatrist completed the YMRS as eligibility criterion, as well as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) [ ], Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale (ASRM) [ ], and STAI-Y1 and Y2 [ ] with the BD participants. The higher the scores, the greater the amount of what was measured (e.g., depression, mania, or anxiety). Moreover, the Positive And Negative Affective State (PANAS) questionnaire [ ] was also administered. Additional clinical information (i.e., pharmacological treatment, history of psychotic symptoms, age of onset of BD, duration, mood temporal pattern, and number of manic, hypomanic, or depressive episodes) is reported in  . \n\n\n### 2.3. MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired at the Radiology Department of Padua University Hospital with a Siemens MAGNETOM  1.5 T MRI system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). MRI acquisition included (i) a resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scan during which participants were instructed to stay relaxed with their eyes open while focusing on a fixation cross which was presented in the center of the monitor, and not to think about anything in particular, while remaining motionless (151 continuous functional volumes, repetition time = 2390 ms, echo time = 50 ms, flip angle = 90°, field of matrix = 64 × 64 × 36, acquisition voxel size = 1.8 × 1.8 × 6 mm ; acquisition time 6:00 min) and (ii) a task-based fMRI acquisition, which was performed with the same acquisition parameters of the resting state scan. A high-resolution 3D T1-weighted structural MRI (sMRI) was also acquired using a gradient-echo sequence (160 sagittal slices, repetition time = 2000 ms, echo time = 3.13 ms, flip angle = 20°, field of matrix = 320 × 320 × 160, acquisition voxel size = 0.656 × 0.656 × 1 mm ; acquisition time 5:33 min). None of the subjects in this study reported anxiety or another particular discomfort during scanning or fell asleep. Following the MRI acquisition, all scans were visually inspected by a trained neuroradiologist to exclude gross pathology alterations, excessive motion, or major scanner artifacts. To quantify eventual head motion artifacts, we calculated the 151 framewise displacement [FD] [ ] computed as the sum of the absolute values of the derivatives of the translational and rotational realignment estimates at every timepoint, for which we reported values below 0.5 for all groups and conditions (FD  = 0.17 ± 0.1, FD  = 0.18 ± 0.11, FD  = 0.26 ± 0.14, FD  = 0.28 ± 0.11). \n\n\n### 2.4. Language Task \n  \nAfter the resting state acquisition, participants performed a silent verbal fluency task during scanning. The task consisted of a letter presented in the center of a monitor for two minutes, during which participants were asked to mentally produce as many noun words as possible starting with a given letter. This task was repeated three times, consecutively, with different letters, i.e., C, P, and S (total acquisition time 6:00 min). Participants were asked to be careful because the given letter would change from time to time. At the end of the silent task, we asked participants to orally repeat as many noun words as possible starting with the last letter “S” within the next 30 s. Immediately after the appearance of these written instructions, the experimenter warned, via microphone, that the participant could start. \n\nThe experimenter recorded each performance using a portable recording device. Offline, the recording was transcribed in the participant’s file. As a final step, two expert neuropsychologists independently rated the number of correctly generated words. There were no critical cases, as all the ratings corresponded. \n\n\n### 2.5. MR Data Preprocessing \n  \nfMRI data were preprocessed via a standard automated procedure implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and based on SPM12 ( , accessed on 1 September 2022), which we used in previous works from our research group [ , ]. This automated pipeline, which strictly follows the standard steps reported in SPM12 documentation ( , accessed on 1 September 2022), included (i) motion correction for the functional image volumes, (ii) spatial alignment of the structural image to the functional data, and (iii) bias field correction for the functional data. These steps were all performed in native space. Following the (iv) co-registration of the functional data to MNI standard space using non-linear warping, (v) spatial smoothing of the functional data was finally performed with a 6 mm full-width half maximum [ , ]. For the normalization step, we used the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI152) structural template image, adopted as the standard template by the International Consortium for Brain Mapping. \n\n\n### 2.6. Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nFor both the resting state and the task-based conditions, we performed functional connectivity analysis, separately for each subject, using spatial independent component analysis (ICA) [ , ]. This is a commonly used approach for resting state investigations, and here we also applied it to the silent fluency task, which we considered an “active” condition different from resting state. In particular, we used ICA to decompose the fMRI data into specific patterns, originating from independent sources, starting from the spatial covariance of the measured fMRI signals [ ]. We estimated for each dataset the number of ICs via the minimum description length criterion [ ]. This is a powerful method to achieve the best model using the shortest description of the data. For the resting state and the task-based scans, we extracted 35–75 ICs and 43–75 ICs, respectively, depending on the specific fMRI dataset. ICs were calculated using the Fast ICA algorithm proposed by Hyvarinen (1999) [ ], with a deflation approach and hyperbolic tangent non-linearity [ ]. This algorithm is implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and can be downloaded at the link  , accessed on 1 September 2022. For each IC, a spatial map and an associated time series were derived. In particular, these spatial maps express the intensity of the activity across the voxels of that pattern, whereas the time series correspond to their course over time [ , ]. For each IC, the spatial map was converted to z-scores by subtracting the average intensity across voxels and dividing the resulting map by the standard deviation across voxels. In this present study, our goal was to investigate the influence of an engaging task, such as the silent verbal fluency task, on LN intrinsic organization. We, therefore, focused on the ICs corresponding to the LN, which we expected to be the network mostly involved in the linguistic task described above. To select the independent component associated with the LN, in each subject and each scan, we used a resting state LN spatial template from a previous study [ ]. This was performed twice for each subject, once for the ICs extracted from the resting state data and once for the ones extracted from the task-based data. The IC corresponding to the LN was identified using an automated template-matching procedure based on a linear regression between ICs and each template [ ]. Each LN component, for each subject, was identified using a quantitative comparison with a template of the LN. The LN template was derived from the group-level map of the LN from a previous study [ ]. The LN component was identified by selecting the IC with the highest spatial correlation with the LN template. Correlation values resulting from this template-matching procedure, and a few representative examples of individual LN spatial maps for each group and condition, are reported in the  . \n\n\n### 2.7. Statistical Analysis \n  \nFor each subject, we extracted the IC corresponding to the LN from the data acquired during both rest and task, and we then performed group-level and comparative analyses to identify those regions that were recruited (or not) between the two conditions and between the two study groups. Following the estimation of the single-subject level LN spatial map, we derived the LN group-level correlation maps, for both the resting state and task-based conditions, by performing a one-sample t-test, using a mass-univariate analysis. With this approach, a significant correlation at the group level is associated, for each considered network, with a certain voxel, when this voxel displays a significant group effect. The significance level was corrected for multiple comparisons between single-subject z-score correlation maps using the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) procedure. This procedure does not make any assumptions about sample dependency [ ]. The significance threshold for the LN group-level correlation maps was set to   p   < 0.05, using BH-FDR correction. This was computed separately for each group, i.e., the HC and the BD groups, to visualize the average LN functional connectivity patterns for both the resting state and the task-based condition. We then performed, for each network, the comparison between the HC and the BD groups for both the resting state and the task-based conditions. This was performed via a two-sample   t  -test on the individual LN maps derived for the two groups to detect regional differences in the LN maps when the participants were resting and when they were performing the silent fluency task. For the task condition only, the number of generated words was included in the analysis as covariate. This was necessary because groups were different in the years of education, which was, in turn, correlated with the number of words recalled at the end of the experiment. In addition, a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used for the construction of a voxel-wise regressor including task performance as covariate (as well as task performance and education as covariates; see  ). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Socio-Demographical and Clinical Data \n  \nNo significant socio-demographical differences between HC and BD groups emerged (all t < 1.0), apart from education years which differed between groups (t  = 2.53,   p   = 0.017). All BD patients were pharmacologically treated with mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anxiolytics ( ; further details in [ ]). \n\n\n### 3.2. Fluency Task \n  \nNo overall differences were found in terms of the number of generated words and stated at the end of the experiment (mean ± standard deviation: HC = 6.50 ± 2.85, BD = 5.87 ± 2.87; t  = 0.62, ns). As healthy controls revealed more education years than BD patients (15.62 ± 3.96 vs. 12.06 ± 4.01 years, respectively), we aimed to test whether this difference affected the performance at the statistical level. As expected, we found a positive correlation between the years of education and the performance at the fluency task (i.e., number of generated words) (r  = 0.42,   p   = 0.015). Accordingly, the higher the number of education years, the greater the number of words referred to after the silent verbal fluency task. \n\n\n### 3.3. ICA LN Spatial Maps at Rest \n  \n depicts the random-effect group-level t-maps for LN of HC (top row) and BD patients (middle row) during resting state, as well as the random-effect group-level t-map for the difference between control and patient groups (bottom row). For both groups, the LN recruited typical areas in the left hemisphere, such as the Broca’s area/frontal operculum (BA44–45), insula (BA13), premotor and supplementary motor areas (BA6), angular gyrus (BA39), and superior and middle temporal gyrus (BA21–22) [ ]. However, in the BD group, the LN also included the following homologous regions in the right hemisphere ( , second row, hot color scale): the insula (BA13), Broca’s area (BA45), the pars orbitalis (BA47), and the putamen. In the control group, we also observed the recruitment of regions in the right hemisphere, specifically in the middle temporal gyrus (BA21) and in the frontal eye fields (BA8). \n\nThe between-group analyses (third row of  , red and green color scale, for BD > HC and BD < HC contrasts) showed that BD had significantly higher connectivity compared to the control group in the right putamen (MNI coordinates: 22, 18, −1; the number of voxels: 14 voxels, t-score of the peak voxel in the significant cluster: −2.88) and right premotor/supplementary motor areas (BA6, MNI coordinates: 48, −4, 38, voxels: 19, t-score: −2.79). Greater connectivity for BD was also found in the left primary auditory area (BA41, MNI coordinates: −44, −24, 2, voxels: 22, t-score: −2.95), left insula (BA13, MNI coordinates: −41, 5, 2, voxels: 17, t-score: −2.84) and left premotor/supplementary motor areas (BA6, MNI coordinates: −45, −4, 8, voxels: 38, t-score: −3.7). Conversely, HC reported significantly higher connectivity in the right fusiform gyrus (BA37, MNI coordinates: 59, −47, 1, voxels: 34, t-score: 3.17) and left angular gyrus (BA39, MNI coordinates: −60, −42, 3, voxels: 33, t-score: 3.26). \n\n\n### 3.4. ICA LN Spatial Maps during Fluency Task \n  \n shows the random-effect group-level t-maps for LN of HC (top row) and BD patients (middle row) during the verbal fluency task, as well as the random-effects group-level t-map for the difference between the control and patient groups (bottom row). As for the resting state condition, during task execution, LN mainly recruited the typical left lateralized regions characteristic of this network (see, [ ]). However, compared to the resting state, the verbal fluency task induced decreased connectivity in the left parietal areas in both HC and BD groups. This qualitative difference is supported by the random-effect group-level t-map for the difference between rest and task conditions for each group (see  ). \n\nCompared with HC, BD patients showed lower recruitment of the left middle temporal gyrus, together with the concurrent recruitment of the right insula (BA13), right Broca’s area/ operculum (BA44), and right primary motor areas (BA4;  , middle row, purple color scale). No regions in the right hemisphere were activated for the control group ( , top row, cyan color scale). \n\nThe between-group analyses (third row of  , purple and cyan color scale, for BD > HC and BD < HC contrasts) showed that BD had significantly higher connectivity compared to healthy controls in the right insula (BA13, MNI coordinates: 35, 14, 2, voxels: 46, t-score: −4.14), right middle temporal gyrus (BA21, MNI coordinates: 61, −32, 0, voxels: 39, t-score: −3.78), and right superior temporal gyrus (BA22, MNI coordinates: 60, −30, 0, voxels: 45, t-score: −4.84), but also in the left insula (BA13, MNI coordinates: −37, 11, 0, voxels: 174, t-score: −5.63). The control group reported higher connectivity compared to BD patients in regions of the left hemisphere only, including Broca’s area (BA45, MNI coordinates: −49, 21, 0, voxels: 656, t-score: 5.91), middle temporal gyrus (BA21, MNI coordinates: −58, −34, 0, voxels: 246, t-score: 5.69), and pars orbitalis (BA47, MNI coordinates: −43, 24, 0, voxels: 53, t-score: 3.97). \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we investigated the influence of a verbal fluency task on LN organization in BD patients, aiming to investigate alterations of language lateralization [ ] along the continuum of psychotic spectrum disorders [ , ]. A large body of literature examined the neural underpinnings of different psychopathologies, suggesting that abnormalities of language pathways lead to the emergence of psychoses [ , , , , ]. In line with this account, schizophrenia patients exhibited (i) a decreased grey matter volume in regions that are part of the LN [ , , ] and showed (ii) a failure of the typical left hemisphere dominance during linguistic tasks [ , , ]. Functional alterations in the LN were also observed in BD patients in remission (i.e., in the euthymic phase), at least at rest [ ]. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate whether alterations of LN functional connectivity characterize BD patients during the execution of a verbal fluency task. Indeed, an altered LN—bilaterally distributed—at rest could be functionally reactivated during the execution of a linguistic task that typically recruits a set of regions involved in language processing. To this end, we enrolled only patients in the euthymic phase to investigate whether the altered LN spatial distribution represents a stable trait neural correlate to bipolar disorder and, more generally, to a variety of psychotic disorders along the continuum. \n\nThe analysis of the LN at rest showed greater functional connectivity in BD compared to the healthy group in a right-lateralized cluster, including the putamen and the premotor/supplementary motor areas. The role of these regions in the processing of language information (e.g., production, naming, articulation) is well known. However, these functions are commonly associated with areas in the left, rather than in the right, hemisphere [ , ]. Our findings revealed that the LN of BD patients does not show the typical left-lateralized pattern but recruits more symmetrical clusters, including key homologous language regions in the right hemisphere. In line with the psychosis continuum hypothesis, this result is consistent with a recent meta-analysis on schizophrenia patients suffering from auditory verbal hallucinations that showed a decreased grey matter volume in left language regions (i.e., left insula and inferior frontal gyrus) in patients with respect to controls [ ]. Indeed, structural atrophy in these brain areas might disrupt the typical left-hemispheric dominance for language [ , ] and contribute to the activation of two “uncertain” hemispheres rather than the dominant one. Consequently, the activity of the right hemisphere might be no more inhibited by the left one [ ], thus explaining most of the symptoms and metalinguistic impairments characteristics of the most severe psychiatric disorders (e.g., semantic anomalies, thought disorders, ruminations, and auditory hallucinations). \n\nBD patients also showed hyper-connectivity in the left hemisphere, particularly in the insula, primary auditory cortex, and premotor/supplementary motor areas. Therefore, the architecture of BD patients’ LN during the resting state apparently comprises a bilateral linguistic hub inhibiting more posterior regions. Indeed, we found a reduction in FC in the left temporal and parietal (i.e., left angular gyrus) and in right temporal regions (i.e., right fusiform gyrus) in the patients vs. control group. Notably, a series of studies revealed a relationship between the presence of auditory verbal hallucination in schizophrenia patients with altered connectivity within the temporo-parietal and the auditory cortices (for a review, see [ ]). Furthermore, the hallucinatory phenomenon was also associated with increased symmetrical FC in frontal language regions [ ]. As previously observed in schizophrenia cohorts, we found, also in bipolar patients in the euthymic phase, an altered LN configuration that could represent a trait marker explaining most of the symptoms and metalinguistic impairments typical of all severe psychiatric disorders distributed along the psychotic spectrum continuum. \n\nOur aim was to assess the LN organization not only during the resting state but also during a task that typically elicits the activation of a left-lateralized circuitry [ ]. On the basis of previous evidence highlighting the lack of language lateralization in BD at rest [ ], we expected to observe a clear symmetry of the left and right sides during task execution. The results were in line with this assumption; compared to the HC group, BD patients showed greater connectivity in the right insula and right superior and middle temporal gyri. Importantly, as shown in  , the fluency task recruited a greater right cluster compared to the resting state condition. Moreover, the FC in the left insula was larger in BD compared to the control group. The insula is a key region that participates in several cognitive processes (e.g., language production, auditory, speech perception, sensory-motor integration, attention, and emotion) [ , , ], and its dysfunctions were widely reported in schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations [ , , , ]. The presence of similar neural alterations across different psychiatric illnesses supports the idea of the shared markers in the spectrum of psychotic disorders [ ]. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed a lack of asymmetry during the fluency task in BD patients, who recruited both key left and homologous right areas. Interestingly, an fMRI investigation has associated decreased language lateralization, specifically with psychosis [ ]. In that study, psychotic patients with auditory verbal hallucinations, non-psychotic individuals with auditory verbal hallucinations, and healthy adults performed a silent verbal fluency task; no significant differences in brain activation were observed between non-psychotic voices hearers and healthy controls, while psychotic patients differed significantly from both these groups, showing increased activation of left insula and the right precentral gyrus. \n\nTogether with the loss of asymmetry, an important characteristic of our BD group is the additional alteration of the antero-posterior asymmetry of the LN. Within the left hemisphere, the control group reported greater frontal and temporal connectivity (i.e., Broca’s area, middle temporal gyrus, and pars orbitalis) compared to BD patients, whereas the latter did not show any involvement of the posterior temporal part. A possible explanation is that the increased FC of the two (left and right) frontal linguistic hubs in BD patients increases the inhibitory control of the posterior regions. Notably, the left middle temporal gyrus, showing higher FC in controls vs. BD, plays an important role in language processing [ ]. Moreover, a recent study found decreased middle temporal gyrus connectivity in schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations [ ]. In healthy brains, the language network comprises two main clusters: an anterior center specialized in speech production and a posterior one involved in language comprehension [ ]. These clusters are highly interconnected within the left hemisphere, both at the cortical and subcortical levels, to ensure efficient language processing. We speculate that the hyper-connectivity of the anterior centers might inhibit the posterior portions of the temporal lobe in bipolar patients, also when there are no frank symptoms in the remitted patients (i.e., during euthymia). Past research using language tasks in euthymic BD patients is quite limited; nevertheless, Curtis et al. found abnormal prefrontal activation in patients compared to controls during semantic and phonetic tasks [ ]. Specifically, they found no difference in the behavioral performance of BD patients compared with controls, together with greater left prefrontal activation (6, 44, and 45 BAs) during phonetic tasks and no differences in the right hemisphere in patients and healthy controls. Results are relatively in line with the greater activation we found during our fluency task in the left insula, also including a small posterior portion of left BA44. Our results are comparable with those of [ ], but the following differences should be noted: (1) the phonetic tasks of [ ] consisted of two tasks collapsed, i.e., verbal fluency (as in our study) and a rhyming task; (2) in the quoted study connectivity in the LN network was not investigated. \n\nAnother interesting finding is that in euthymic BD patients, we found similar results during resting state and task conditions. However, the anterior symmetrical distribution of the LN and the reduced posterior temporal connectivity were more enhanced during the verbal fluency task. In other words, the functional activation of linguistic circuits during the silent fluency task is not enough to restore the typical left hemisphere dominance in BD euthymic patients; rather, the altered LN spatial distribution represents a stable neural correlate of bipolar disorder and, arguably, of a variety of psychotic disorders along the continuum. The similar LN imbalance found at rest and during task execution is in line with the hypothesis that intrinsic brain activity can shape the network organization during a related task [ ]. The importance of brain spontaneous activity is also supported by its link with clinical symptomatology. Several recent studies on neurological and psychiatric populations have found correlations between network disruption at rest and specific impairments/symptoms [ , , , , ]. For example, resting-state LN abnormalities were found to be positively associated with residual mania and negatively correlated with depression in BD patients [ ]. As previously proposed, the spontaneous brain organization is able to affect task-induced activations [ ] and might represent an informative marker of healthy and pathological brain function. \n\nThis study has some limitations, such as the relatively small number of participants and the potential effect of pharmacological treatments. Most of our patients were taking medications (i.e., mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anxiolytics), which could alter the BOLD signal. However, we only included in our sample euthymic patients in a stable phase of the disorder. Future studies on larger samples should investigate the impact of long-term medication on brain networks involved in language processing. Additionally, by increasing statistical power thanks to adequate and balanced samples, as well as specific hypotheses on brain functioning, future exploratory whole-brain analyses might reveal further differences in functional connectivity between task and resting conditions and extend the applicability of this approach to other tasks and brain networks, also depending on patients’ clinical phenotype. In particular, the comparison between BD patients type I and type II appears critical to clarify the contribution of psychotic symptoms to alter the brain functional connectivity. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nOur data provided new insights into the neural signatures of BD and showed how a fluency task alters the intrinsic organization of the LN. First, we found that the euthymic BD patients had reduced left dominance in the LN during both resting state and task conditions. Second, the configuration of the LN was different for the BD patients compared to the control group in both conditions, as BD patients recruited two symmetric frontal hubs, and disengaged left temporal regions, during task execution. Finally, LN alterations in BD supported the presence of a shared neural mechanism in the psychiatric continuum, which includes schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder [ , , ]. Since language is at the top of all higher cognitive processes by integrating and connecting many associative brain regions, its disruption could explain the variety of manifestations of different psychotic disorders, namely the disorder of thoughts, distractibility, and impulsivity typical of BD. At the same time, it could also explain the elevated vulnerability of BD patients, apparently in remission, to relapse. In this perspective, LN dysconnectivity may be considered a promising trans-diagnostic marker for psychotic spectrum disorders and psychosis vulnerability in people at high risk. Additional studies are warranted to confirm the key role of LN in the psychoses and to correlate its FC to psychiatric symptoms as already performed in neurological patients [ , , ]. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"332b469e9aca151e086a5fc22064b841"},

Combining findings from multiple fMRI modalities can offer valuable information for characterizing and managing optic neuropathies. In this article, we review a subset of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) studies of optic neuropathies. We consider glaucoma, acute optic neuritis (ON), discuss traumatic optic neuropathy (TON), and explore consistency between findings from RS and visually driven fMRI studies. Consistent with visually driven studies, glaucoma studies at rest also indicated reduced activation in the visual cortex and dorsal visual stream. RS-fMRI further reported varying levels of functional connectivity in the ventral stream depending on disease severity. ON patients show alterations within the visual cortex in both fMRI techniques. Particularly, higher-than-normal RS activity is observed in the acute phase and decreases as the disease progresses. A similar pattern is observed in the visual cortex of TON-like, open globe injury (OGI), patients. Additionally, visually driven and RS-fMRI studies of ON patients show recovery of brain activity in the visual cortex. RS-fMRI suggests recovery of signals in higher-tier visual areas MT and LOC as well. Finally, RS-fMRI has not yet been applied to TON, although reviewing OGI studies suggests that it is feasible. Future RS-fMRI studies of optic neuropathies could prioritize studying the fine scale RS activity of brain areas that visually driven studies have identified. We suggest that a more systematic longitudinal comparison of optic neuropathies with advanced fMRI would provide improved diagnostic and prognostic information. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOptic neuropathy refers broadly to a disease of the optic nerve. It is a serious condition that may result in deficits in the visual field (partial or even full blindness). This type of injury can develop acutely or chronically. Acute optic neuropathies such as optic neuritis (ON) and traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) have a rapid onset and are typically caused by inflammation and/or trauma, whereas chronic optic neuropathies such as glaucoma are characterized by a slow onset ( ). The aim of this selective review is to identify the reported optic neuropathy-related changes within the visual system as reported in resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) studies, and assess the consistency between RS-fMRI and visually driven fMRI findings for each optic neuropathy. We strive to provide insights into the common and differential effects of chronic versus acute onset of optic neuropathies over the course of the disease along with central versus peripheral visual field defects on visual brain areas. A summary of visually driven fMRI results is provided for reference ( ). This review is offered as a companion to the longer review of visually driven studies published in this same issue, with the same inclusion criteria ( ). We note that graph-theory analysis RS-fMRI papers were excluded as they have not been utilized to study all optic neuropathies we consider in this manuscript. In addition, they mainly focus on brain alternations outside the visual system, which is beyond the scope of this review. \n  \nSummary of resting-state and visually driven fMRI findings in Glaucoma, Optic Neuritis and Traumatic Optic Neuropathy.   Left:   fMRI findings of glaucoma, ON and (TON-like) OGI patients are summarized based on visual areas that were investigated and themes that were revealed in our analysis of visually driven and RS-fMRI literature of each optic neuropathy. Findings from rapidly changing optic neuropathies such as ON and OGI have been split into three stages of the disease: acute – within 1 month of disease onset, recovering – 3–4 months from disease onset, and remote –1 year or more since disease onset.   Right:   pictorial representation of the fMRI findings within LGN and visual cortical areas, specifically lower visual areas, dorsal visual stream and ventral visual stream, for glaucoma patients, ON patients at different stages of the disease and OGI patients. \n  \n### Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging \n  \nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging is emerging as a powerful tool to non-invasively quantify brain activity at rest (i.e., spontaneous brain activity) of both intact visual brain regions and visual regions that have lost visual input (e.g.,  ). RS-fMRI allows for the study of local organization and functional connectivity (FC) of brain structures via temporal synchronization of neuronal activity. The resting BOLD (blood oxygen level-dependent) signal can be analyzed using various techniques. Below, we describe RS-fMRI analysis techniques employed in optic neuropathy studies. \n\nAmplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) are functional    segregation    methods for identifying neural networks across the whole brain, where brain regions are divided according to their presumed shared function, and provides information about local neural activity rather than FC between different regions ( ). ALFF evaluates the combined BOLD signal in a region of interest by measuring the brain signal variability of each voxel in a particular frequency domain. ReHo is a method to evaluate the synchrony or “similarity” of the time course of each voxel in a region of interest to its neighboring voxels in the time domain ( ). Alternatively, the following methods measure temporal synchronization between separated brain regions to assess functional    integration   . Strong FC may arise from direct or indirect anatomic connections or by way of having common input. Seed-based methods determine the brain regions closely associated with the BOLD time-series of a seed region, i.e., any brain region determined in an   a priori   manner. In comparison, independent component analysis (ICA) is more data-driven and ideally detects all functionally connected networks within the brain. However, the number of networks that can be detected is limited by the number of independent components specified. A few commonly identified RS-networks include the default mode network, medial executive network, working memory, and visual network ( ). Finally, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) is a specific voxel-wise analysis method in which the synchrony between geometrically corresponding interhemispheric regions at rest is quantified. It is yet to be determined what combination of RS-fMRI analysis methods could be most sensitive to detecting optic neuropathy-related brain deficits. \n\n\n\n## Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in glaucoma \n  \nGlaucoma is a chronic optic neuropathy resulting from the loss of retinal ganglion cells. It is characterized by reduced retinal thickness, peripheral vision loss in the early stages of the disease, followed by central visual field loss, and eventual low vision or blindness ( ;  ). Here, we consider the most common form, primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). The effects of the visual deficits on the FC of cortical networks are yet to be fully understood. We selectively identified 12 RS-fMRI peer-reviewed articles with patient groups that meet our inclusion criteria and findings relevant to the themes revealed in our analysis of the   visually driven   glaucoma literature ( ). We aim to explore here if RS-fMRI findings reveal results similar to those obtained with visually driven protocols. We thus expected to find: (1) reduced activity in lower visual areas, especially eccentricity-specific deficits, (2) disease severity-specific alterations in brain activity; for example biased loss of activity in LGN magnocellular layers in early POAG patients, and compromised cortical representation of central visual field only in advanced patients, and (3) remapping in visual cortices with enlarged parafoveal regions and/or higher-than-normal activity in visual association and higher-level cortical areas. \n\nAs expected, RS-studies utilizing functional   segregation   methods do in fact indicate poor local specialization in regions of the visual network of POAG patients. For instance, ALFF values were lower in the cuneus ( ) and ReHo revealed lower synchrony between neighboring voxels in the bilateral calcarine cortex ( ). Likewise, functional   integration   methods noted dysconnectivity   between   lower-tier and higher-tier visual areas ( ;  ). ICA and voxel-wise analyses revealed decreased FC between the primary and secondary visual cortices ( ), and reduced interhemispheric synchronization of homotopic primary and secondary visual areas ( ;  ). However, we note that there are no RS-fMRI studies that investigate retinotopy-specific functional alterations   within   primary visual areas in glaucoma patients at a fine scale. This has already been achieved in healthy controls (e.g.,  ,  ) as well as in amblyopia ( ), and could potentially identify the progression of glaucoma based on the representation of the central and peripheral eccentricities. \n\nWith regard to the higher-level visual cortex, we noted common reports of abnormally low resting connectivity in the ventral visual stream based on: (1) ALFF ( ;  ), (2) ICA-based FC ( ), (3) cerebral blood flow-FC strength ( ), (4) VMHC ( ), and (5) voxel-wise analysis ( ). In comparison, there are fewer reports of deficits in the dorsal stream (i.e., ReHo) ( ), or functional dysconnectivity between primary visual cortex and dorsal visual stream (i.e., VMHC and voxel-wise analysis) ( ). While interesting, this moderate tendency for greater involvement of the ventral visual cortex was not evident in our review of studies using visually driven fMRI with glaucoma patients. Instead, that review hinted at the loss of magnocellular input – at least in early POAG – which is expected to most severely affect the dorsal visual stream. It thus remains to be understood if these tentative trends are reproduced, and exactly how such biases depend on severity. \n\nAs per our second hypothesis, the RS-fMRI literature shows that the pattern and extent of alterations are dependent on glaucoma severity. From the limited number of studies that report results in specific POAG subgroups, it can be noted that the areas in the ventral visual network show low resting FC in early POAG patients (inferior temporal gyrus and LOC) ( ;  ), and a combination of low and high FC patterns in advanced POAG patients ( ). For example, FC of some areas in advanced POAG is lower (lingual gyrus), whereas others are unexpectedly higher (LOC and temporo-occipital fusiform cortex) compared to controls ( ). Although the abnormalities in the ventral visual stream could be consistent with the loss of central representation observed in advanced glaucoma patients, it is unclear why this effect is evident even in early POAG patients. Lastly, in comparison with visually driven fMRI, RS-fMRI studies emphasize functional alterations beyond visual areas in cortical areas proximal to the visual network from early stages of the disease (e.g., the memory and DMN networks) (e.g.,  ). \n\nConcerning our third hypothesis, regarding compensatory activity, RS-fMRI of glaucoma patients also reveals abnormally high brain activity, but generally in areas more distal from the visual network. For example, high resting FC can be observed within the medial executive network or other distant higher-level brain regions, as well as between these networks and the visual network ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). This common type of observation is usually considered to reflect some unspecified state of “compensation.” Such concepts are poorly understood, but do at least document that bidirectional changes in activity are likely the result of localized damage to a complex network. \n\n\n## Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in optic neuritis \n  \nOptic neuritis is an acute optic neuropathy resulting from inflammation, and subsequent lesions of the optic nerve, followed by spontaneous recovery. In the acute stages of the disease (e.g., within 1 month of onset), the affected eye displays greatly delayed and decreased visually evoked potential (VEP) responses (i.e., demyelinated optic nerve), as well as poor visual acuity and color vision ( ). Subsequently, visual acuity begins to improve during the recovery phase at around 3–4 months and reaches normal or near-normal vision at 1-year from disease onset, although a reduction in retinal thickness and other abnormalities continue to exist ( ). Here, we review 5 peer-reviewed articles studying RS-fMRI brain activity in ON patients that meet our inclusion criteria to explore commonalities in findings with visually driven fMRI studies ( ). Specifically, we would expect: (1) functional deficit within low-level visual cortex in the early stages of ON, (2) functional alterations within higher-tier areas, specifically decreased activity within the ventral visual stream (i.e., visual cortical region LOC) and a trend toward hyperactivity in the dorsal stream of early-stage ON patients, and (3) recovery of activity in LGN, visual cortex, and ventral visual stream, but persistent deficit likely in the dorsal stream (i.e., cortical area MT). \n  \nPatient demographic and disease information from ON and (TON-like) OGI studies reviewed in this paper. Studies are listed in increasing order of average onset duration in patient population at the time of data collection. Unless stated, all studies included patients without other apparent cause of vision loss and retro geniculate diseases. ON = optic neuritis; OGI = open globe injury. \n  \nTo our surprise, and contrary to visually driven fMRI reports, an increase in resting activity was observed in the occipital lobe immediately (i.e., within a week) after ON onset ( ;  ). Similarly, while visually driven fMRI studies reported reduced activity in the ventral visual stream, the majority of current RS-fMRI studies indicate increased ALFF values in many temporal lobe brain structures ( ;  ). However, in another study, ReHo analysis suggests an overall brain   deficit   at rest ( ). Moreover, studies predominantly suggest a resting deficit within the dorsal cortical areas (i.e., fronto-parietal structures), at least during the very early stages of the disease ( ;  ;  ). Interestingly, a different pattern is evident for the visual cortex of patients scanned around 50 days from ON onset. Now in agreement with findings reported with visually driven fMRI, lower resting connectivity is observed from the visual cortex ( ). RS-FC between the visual cortex and the fronto-parietal cortex remains impaired as reported in the acute stage of ON ( ). However, the relationship between the activity of extra-striate regions and patients’ visual function outcomes is unclear. \n\nConsistent with the recovery of BOLD signals observed in the visually driven fMRI literature at 3–4 months from disease onset, one RS study with a majority of ON patients in the recovery phase revealed higher-than-normal resting FC within the visual network. For instance, abnormally high resting activity was reported in the lower (i.e., calcarine sulcus) and higher visual areas (i.e., LOC and MT) of the visual network ( ). This might suggest that recovery of function is partially supported by adaptive changes in connectivity. Importantly, as expected, MT connectivity was seen to increase as the inter-eye VEP latency difference in ON patients decreased. As also concluded in the visually driven review, this suggests that the increased activity in the visual pathway is at least partly due to the reduced inflammation of the optic nerve. However, the abnormally high resting signal observed in the visual pathway raises the possibility for additional involvement by adaptive plasticity mechanisms. \n\nFinally, the activity of LGN in ON patients has not been investigated with RS-fMRI yet, despite its ability to produce distinct levels of activity during the acute and recovery phase of ON and its potential use in objectively staging patients, as shown in visually driven fMRI. Likewise, RS-fMRI is yet to be utilized to study activity in subcortical and cortical visual regions of purely recovered ON patients. This is a particularly important group to study as it would allow us to evaluate the extent of recovery possible in areas along the visual pathway, and determine the correlation to earlier time points of visual function and BOLD measures, potentially informing the prediction of prognosis. \n\n\n## Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in traumatic optic neuropathy \n  \nTraumatic optic neuropathy causes acute partial or complete, unilateral or bilateral visual loss following injury to the optic nerve and demyelination of afferent visual pathways due to trauma. It can be further categorized into direct and indirect trauma, depending on how the optic nerve was affected ( ). Like ON, substantial recovery is generally observed to take place ( ). Diagnosis of TON with current neuro-ophthalmological tools may be challenging as trauma patients could have cognitive impairments. TON is typically assessed using the afferent pupillary reflex, but this is insensitive to bilateral TON ( ). Thus, utilizing RS-fMRI, a non-demanding imaging technique, might provide real diagnostic and prognostic value in clinical settings. Similar to our review of TON using visually driven fMRI, we found no peer-reviewed articles that studied TON using RS-fMRI. Therefore, we reviewed four papers on patients with a similar trauma, called open globe injury (OGI) ( ). OGI results in injury to the eye-wall and is more readily diagnosed. \n\nResting changes of the whole brain in OGI patients were studied using voxel-wise degree centrality ( ), ReHo ( ), ALFF ( ), and VMHC ( ). Indeed, functional deficit was evident within and between the two hemispheres of the brain in patients with acute lesions to the anterior visual pathway. However, the direction of the effect is quite variable and highly dependent on time since onset. For example, resting cortical activity of OGI patients within 1–2 days of onset is higher-than-normal compared to controls, especially in the primary visual cortex and precuneus as shown by degree centrality ( ) and ALFF ( ) values, as well as in lingual gyrus as shown by ALFF values ( ). Interestingly, a different pattern is revealed in patients that were tested 3 days after OGI onset. Those patients display   lower   VMHC values compared to controls in the brain regions such as bilateral calcarine, lingual and cuneus and structures in the dorsal visual pathway such as the middle occipital gyrus displayed ( ). This is consistent with findings from a single TON-related case report discussed in our visually driven review ( ). Importantly, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves have been used to identify brain regions based on their resting FC measures that may be used as biomarkers to distinguish OGI patients from healthy controls. With a range of analysis techniques (VMHC, ALFF and mean ReHo), ROC values regularly show areas under the curve in the range of 0.7–0.9 for the visual cortex and non-visual cortex ( ;  ;  ), suggesting activity within the reported regions may be useful as diagnostic markers. \n\nTaken together, OGI and TON are rapidly changing conditions that require immediate attention and treatment. It appears that initially hyperactive brain regions show deficits as the disease progresses. However, this is difficult to assert, based on the limited number of studies available, all acute cross-sectional studies. It is evident that RS-fMRI could provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis and progression of acute optic neuropathies such as TON. Therefore, if fMRI techniques are employed more frequently and ambitiously, advancement in the diagnosis or prognosis of TON might be possible. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOverall, when considering the visual system specifically, both RS-fMRI and visually driven fMRI studies are often consistent in the reported findings in each optic neuropathy. In chronic diseases such as glaucoma, both fMRI modalities report reduced activity in visual networks. However, RS-fMRI more commonly suggests deficits in the ventral than the dorsal visual stream, and the ventral FC pattern becomes more diverse with increasing glaucoma severity. For acute diseases such as ON and (TON like) OGI, RS-activity reveals that higher-than-normal activity is briefly observed at onset, before it ultimately shows a deficit as seen in visually driven fMRI studies. Both modalities report deficits within the dorsal pathway in ON from onset. So far, both visual streams are shown to be affected in acute OGI at rest, although no visually driven fMRI results exist. \n\nWe highlight here several important concluding points. Firstly, the resting activity of the LGN has not yet been investigated with RS-fMRI in any of the diseases we considered. This would be of particular interest given the LGN’s proximity to the optic nerve and the fact that it conveniently maintains the segregation of inputs from each eye. In addition, if resolution allows, patterns of connectivity for magnocellular or parvocellular layers would provide additional information about the pathophysiology of these diseases. In fact, this has already been reported for one fMRI study of glaucoma that used parvo- or magno-biased visual stimuli ( ). In addition, visually driven fMRI studies of ON patients have noted distinct patterns of activity within LGN during the acute and recovery stage ( ). \n\nSecondly, we suggest that better use of regions of interest within the visual cortex based on   a priori   hypotheses would improve the sensitivity of RS-fMRI studies to the direct effects of deafferentation. Many distinct visual areas can now be defined based on retinotopic organization or other functional characteristics. The lateral occipital region (LOC) is quite important for object perception and contains a prominent representation of the central visual field (separate from the occipital pole). Another area that may be useful to better exploit is MT, a motion-sensitive region where the magnocellular LGN inputs are expected to have a strong impact. Future studies should examine RS-fMRI activation patterns within and between multiple visual areas, as this has the potential to increase sensitivity. Probabilistic atlases now allow the location of many extrastriate areas to be estimated, even without direct mapping in each subject (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). In fact, it is even possible to use regions of interest   within   a single retinotopic visual area to study fine-scale resting networks, and document changes in central versus peripheral eccentricities ( ;  ). \n\nThird, we found no obvious pattern regarding the sensitivity of the different RS-fMRI analysis methods reported here, but we remain convinced that different methods are likely to reveal distinct aspects of pathology. As such, future studies that directly compare multiple analysis methods would be of enormous value. Lastly, the cross-sectional design common to most of these studies is a clear limitation. Although there is great value in following the same group of patients longitudinally, as shown by a limited number of visually driven fMRI studies ( ), this is rarely done in RS-studies of optic neuropathies. \n\nIn summary, we suggest that RS-fMRI data could prove increasingly valuable for characterizing optic neuropathies, particularly in the case of TON, and for managing disease progression. Given that RS-fMRI does not utilize visual stimulation or a task-induced response, it is well-suited to study vision in cognitively challenged patients or patients that are unable to maintain fixation. Moreover, the high sensitivity of fMRI data to central vision loss due to the high cortical magnification of the central field could be hugely beneficial in studying TON. In combination with other MRI modalities, including structural MRI, it could be even more powerful. For future efforts to uncover basic mechanisms of functional loss and recovery, studies that compare visually driven and RS-fMRI findings from local visual areas and closely related brain networks in the same cohort of subjects would be most useful. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nJM and AS conceived the idea.

The effect of neurofeedback training on resting-state functional connectivity warrants investigation as changes in spontaneous brain activation could reflect the association between sustained symptom relief and brain alteration. We investigated the effect of amygdala-focused rtfMRI-nf training on resting-state functional connectivity in combat veterans with and without posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who were trained to increase a feedback signal reflecting left amygdala activity while recalling positive autobiographical memories ( ). The analysis was performed in three stages: i) first, we investigated the connectivity in the left amygdala region; ii) next, we focused on the abnormal resting-state functional connectivity identified in our previous analysis of this data ( ); and iii) finally, we performed a novel data-driven longitudinal connectome-wide analysis. We introduced a longitudinal multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR) analysis to comprehensively examine neurofeedback training effects beyond those associated with abnormal baseline connectivity. \n\nThese comprehensive exploratory analyses suggested that abnormal resting-state connectivity for combat veterans with PTSD was partly normalized after the training. This included hypoconnectivities between the left amygdala and the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The increase of SMA-dACC connectivity was associated with PTSD symptom reduction. Longitudinal MDMR analysis found a connectivity change between the precuneus and the left superior frontal cortex. The connectivity increase was associated with a decrease in hyperarousal symptoms. The abnormal connectivity for combat veterans without PTSD - such as hypoconnectivity in the precuneus with a superior frontal region and hyperconnectivity in the posterior insula with several regions - could also be normalized after the training. These results suggested that the rtfMRI-nf training effect was not limited to a feedback target region and symptom relief could be mediated by brain modulation in several regions other than in a feedback target area. While further confirmatory research is needed, the results may provide valuable insight into treatment effects on the whole brain resting-state connectivity. \n   Highlights  \n  \nfMRI neurofeedback training effect on resting-state connectivity was examined \n  \nLeft amygdala activity was trained to increase with positive memory \n  \nNeurofeedback normalized altered connectivity in veterans with and without PTSD \n  \nPTSD symptom reductions were significant but not specific to group (exp/ctrl) \n  \nConnectivity-symptom association was seen in mPFC and precuneus \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nNeurofeedback training with real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI-nf) enables self-regulation of brain activation by presenting ongoing brain activation measured with the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal ( ). Emerging evidence suggests clinical utility of self-regulation of brain activation with rtfMRI-nf training. This includes, but is not limited to, rtfMRI-nf training to major depressive disorder (MDD) patients ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients ( ;  ). These studies demonstrated that participants can learn to self-regulate feedback target regions as a result of rtfMRI-nf training. Symptom reduction effects, however, have not been consistent and the associations between therapeutic and neurobiological effects are not clear. As our knowledge of the neurofeedback treatment effect on whole brain activation is still limited, more exploratory research on how neurofeedback brain modulation impacts psychiatric symptoms is necessary. \n\nResting-state fMRI functional connectivity ( ) has potential for elucidating brain changes underlying rtfMRI-nf therapeutic effects. This measure evaluates correlations among BOLD signals during rest. Examining the effects of rtfMRI-nf on this spontaneous brain activation could yield insight into if the effect of neurofeedback training extends beyond a training context and results in sustained treatment effects. In fact, the effects of neurofeedback training with fMRI and/or EEG are not limited to a training task but have been observed on resting-state functional connectivity as well ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nStudies also showed that neurofeedback training effects are not restricted to a neurofeedback target region.   examined the effect of rtfMRI-nf training to reduce orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activity and found changes in connectivity in many brain regions including reduced connectivity with limbic structures and increased connectivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.   also reported a broad effect of the training in a meta-analysis of rtfMRI-nf training studies. These results suggest symptom reduction may be due to neurobiological changes beyond a targeted region of neurofeedback. The effect of training therefore needs to be examined across the whole-brain to elucidate the neurobiological basis of the therapeutic effect. \n\nFor whole-brain comprehensive functional connectivity analysis, a connectome-wide association approach has been proposed ( ). This approach uses a nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance called multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR). This enables a comprehensive search in whole-brain voxel-by-voxel connectivity without an a priori definition of a seed region ( ;  ). Our previous study ( ) investigated the connectome-wide alteration in resting-state functional connectivity between the groups of combat veterans with and without PTSD and non-trauma exposed healthy controls (NC). The study identified altered connectivities for veterans with PTSD compared to NC, including decreased connectivities between the left parahippocampal region and the visual cortex and between multiple left lateral prefrontal regions and salience network (SN) regions. The study also identified altered connectivities for veterans without PTSD compared to NC including decreased connectivities between the left superior frontal region and the posterior default mode network areas, between the precuneus and the right transverse temporal area as well as the left superior temporal area, and increased connectivity in bilateral posterior insula regions. The analysis did not find a significant connectivity difference between the veterans with and without PTSD. \n\nIn the current study, we extended our previous analysis of resting-state functional connectivity ( ) by examining the effect of the rtfMRI-nf training on resting-state functional connectivity within the same participants. Details regarding the neurofeedback procedure and the effects of the procedure on brain activation during the task have been described in a prior report ( ). Participants were trained to increase the feedback signal from the left amygdala by recalling a positive autobiographical memory. Pathological hyperactivity of the amygdala is consistently observed for PTSD patients, both in response to the presentation of a negative stimulus ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and at rest ( ;  ). A meta-analysis demonstrated that the amygdala response is valence-general; it responds to both positive and negative stimulus presentations ( ).   indicated that the training to increase left amygdala activity with positive memory decreased amygdala response to negative stimuli. This training approach also demonstrated significant depression symptom reduction resulting from the procedure ( ). Given the links between PTSD and abnormal functioning of the amygdala, along with evidence suggesting amygdala-focused neurofeedback reduces depressive symptoms among people with MDD, where abnormal amygdala activity has been observed, it stands to reason that the same rtfMRI-nf training approach has a potential for reducing PTSD symptoms. Indeed, veterans with PTSD showed symptom reduction after the training and the responder rate was larger for the experimental group who received left amygdala neurofeedback than for the control group who received a neurofeedback from a control region (parietal area putatively not involved in emotion regulation) ( ). However, there was no significant difference in symptom change between the groups. This suggests that both amygdala neurofeedback and a non-specific effect to the neurofeedback region could have contributed to symptom reduction. \n\nThe present report focused on changes in resting-state functional connectivity as a result of the training and how such changes were related to PTSD symptom reduction. We also examined resting-state functional connectivity for combat veterans without PTSD. Combat exposure could leave subclinical alterations in their resting-state brain activation ( ). The present study investigated how those alterations were affected by the neurofeedback training. A three-step approach to the analysis of resting-state data was employed to yield a comprehensive exploration of connectivity change. The first analysis investigated resting-state connectivity for the feedback target region, the left amygdala region of interest (ROI). An ordinary seed-based connectivity analysis from the ROI to the whole brain was done to examine altered connectivity for veterans and how that connectivity was affected by the training. The second analysis focused on changes in the abnormal resting-state functional connectivity at baseline that was identified in our previous connectome-wide analysis conducted within the same participants ( ). The third analysis investigated a connectome-wide training effect to identify the effect outside of abnormal connectivity. For this analysis, we developed a longitudinal MDMR analysis. The analysis enabled comprehensive examination of training effects and associations with symptom change in whole brain voxel-by-voxel connectivity. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe participants included in the current analysis were drawn from the same participants described previously by  . Forty male U.S. military combat veterans with PTSD and 22 male U.S. military combat veterans without PTSD (veteran control, VC) participated in the baseline resting-state fMRI scan session. Exclusion criteria included a clinically significant or unstable cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine, neurological, or gastrointestinal illness or unstable medical disorder, meeting DSM-IV criteria for substance abuse or substance dependence (other than nicotine) within 3 months prior to screening, endorsing suicidal intent or a suicide attempt within the preceding three months, current or past history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or dementia, moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, and an inability to complete an MRI scan due to claustrophobia or general MRI exclusions (e.g. shrapnel inside body). Participants with vision and/or hearing loss severe enough to interfere with testing and participants not fluent in English were also excluded. See supplementary material “Veteran participants” section for more details regarding recruitment and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (IRB), Puyallup, WA. All procedures were conducted according to the code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans. Participants provided written informed consent as approved by the IRB. \n\nPTSD participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (PTSD-exp,   N   = 25) where they received left amygdala rtfMRI-nf or to the control group (PTSD-ctrl,   N   = 11) where they received rtfMRI-nf from the left horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus, a region not involved in emotion regulation. Participants were blind to which group they were assigned. All VC participants were in the experimental group (VC-exp). The study consisted of seven visits. Several participants quit voluntarily before completing all the sessions. Four PTSD and one VC did not participate in the training sessions. Two PTSD-exp, one PTSD-ctrl, and one VC-exp quit before the second training session (Visit 4), two PTSD-exp, one PTSD-ctrl, and two VC quit before the third training session (Visit 5), and one PTSD-ctrl quit before the post-training resting-state session (Visit 6). As a result, 30 PTSD (21 PTSD-exp and 9 PTSD-ctrl) and 17 VC participants completed 3 sessions of rtfMRI-nf training and the post-training resting-state scan session. \n\nParticipants with excessive head motion (>40 censored volumes, see MRI measurement and image processing section below for details) were excluded from the analysis. Five PTSD and four VC participants in the baseline session and an additional three PTSD and three VC participants who completed the post-training session were excluded from the analysis. If a participant completed the study but baseline data was not available due to excessive head motion, his data was also excluded from the analysis. One VC participant did not complete the last neurofeedback session but performed the post-training resting-state scan. This participant was included in the analysis because the training effect on resting-state functional connectivity for this participant was not significantly different from others. \n\nThe current study only included participants who completed both the baseline and the post-training sessions. The final number of samples analyzed in the present study and their mean and standard deviation of age were as follows:   N   = 16 (30 ± 6 years-old) for PTSD-exp;   N   = 6 (31±9) for PTSD-ctrl; and   N   = 11 (36±1) for VC. Groups did not significantly differ in regards to age (  F  [2,30] = 1.791,   p   = .184). Motion size (a mean L2-norm of frame-wise displacement) was not different between groups in either session (Baseline:   F  [2,78] = 1.292,   p   = .281, Post-training:   F  [2,30] = 0.404,   p   = .671). \n\nOf these participants, 8 PTSD participants (8 PTSD-exp) endorsed current MDD comorbidity, 5 PTSD participants (2 PTSD-exp, 3 PTSD-ctrl) endorsed partial remitted MDD comorbidity, and 3 PTSD participants (3 PTSD-exp) endorsed a history of MDD that was fully remitted at study time by the baseline assessment. Two VC subjects who participated only in the pre-training session endorsed a history of MDD that was fully remitted by the baseline assessment. A prior analysis indicated that remitted comorbidity was not related to the baseline connectivity difference for the VC group ( ). \n\n\n### RtfMRI-nf training schedule \n  \nVeteran groups participated in three days of rtfMRI-nf training sessions. Details of the training schedule and the training procedures at each visit are provided in the “Schedules of real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) training” section of the supplementary material and  . Supplementary fig. S1 shows mean feedback signals across training sessions for the participants who completed the post-training session. The participants could keep feedback signal increased during the training although the PTSD-ctrl group had difficulty in increasing the signal at several runs. \n\nResting-state scans at the 2nd and 6th visits were analyzed as the baseline and the post-training scans, respectively. No rtfMRI-nf training was performed at these visits and the resting-state scan was performed before any other task runs to avoid contamination from another task. The mean intervals between each visit (and its standard deviation) were 14 ± 13, 11 ± 6, 10 ± 7, 13 ± 8, and 11 ± 6 days for visits 1–2, 2–3, 3–4, 4–5 and 5–6, respectively. The mean interval between the last training session (Visit 5) and the follow-up assessment (Visit 7) was 15±7 days. There was no significant difference in the intervals between the groups. \n\nThe Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) for DSM-IV ( ) and the PTSD Checklist - Military Version (PCL-M) ( ) were used to identify PTSD diagnosis and to measure symptom levels. The CAPS was administered at the first and the last visits by a research staff member trained to mastery in administration of the interview. The staff was blind to which group the participants were assigned. The PCL-M was administered at the 2nd to 6th visits. Depression and anxiety symptoms were also measured at the 2nd to 6th visits by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) ( ) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) ( ), respectively. \n\n\n### MRI measurement and image processing \n  \nThe same resting-state fMRI measurement and image processing procedure as described in   were used in both the baseline and the post-training sessions, which is summarized here. A single-shot gradient-recalled echo-planner imaging (EPI) sequence with sensitivity encoding (SENSE) was used for fMRI with imaging parameters of TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, FA = 90°, FOV = 240 mm, 34 axial slices with 2.9 mm thickness with 0.5 mm gap, matrix = 96 × 96, SENSE acceleration factor   R   = 2. The EPI images were reconstructed into a 128 × 128 matrix resulting 1.875 × 1.875 × 3.4 mm  voxel volume. The resting fMRI run time was 6 min 50s (205 volumes). T1-weighted MRI images were acquired for anatomical reference with magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence. \n\nAnalysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) software ( ) was used for image processing. The process included despike, RETROICOR ( ) and respiration volume per time (RVT) correction ( ), slice-timing and motion corrections, nonlinear warping to the MNI template brain with resampling to 2mm  voxels using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) software ( ) ( ). Further noise reduction was applied by regressing out three principal components of the ventricle signal, local white matter average signal (ANATICOR) ( ), 12 motion parameters (3 shift and 3 rotation parameters with their temporal derivatives), and low-frequency fluctuation (3rd-order Legendre polynomial model) from the signal time course. Any fMRI time point with large motion (>0.25 mm frame-wise displacement (FD)) along with the following point was censored within the regression ( ). \n\n\n### ROI analysis in the neurofeedback target region \n  \nBaseline resting-state connectivity difference between the groups in the neurofeedback target region, LA and HIPS, were examined to complement the previous connectome-wide analysis ( ). LA region of interest (ROI) was anatomically defined using the Jülich histological atlas on MNI template brain ( ) provided with the FSL package. Voxels with larger than 50% probability of the left amygdala region were extracted. HIPS ROI was defined as 7-mm-radius sphere centered at x, y, z = −42, −51, 53 mm in the MNI template brain. The first principal component of voxel resting-state signal time-course was used as a seed time-course. The sign of the principal component signal was adjusted to make its correlation with the mean signal positive. The signal was extracted from a fully processed image (after regressing out noise components). Pearson's correlations between the seed time-course and time-courses in all other brain voxels were calculated and applied Fisher's z-transform (  z   = arctanh(  r  ), where   r   is correlation coefficient) to make a connectivity map. This map was subject to the following group analyses. \n\nThe baseline abnormality of the ROI connectivity was examined by general linear model analysis with group (PTSD, VC, NC), age, and motion size as predictor variables. For this baseline analysis, we included participants who did not complete the rtfMRI-nf training akin to what we had done previously ( ) (see supplementary table S3 for the number of participants in the baseline). The statistical parametric map for the pairwise group contrast was thresholded by   p   < .005 voxel-wise and family-wise error correction by cluster-extent   p   < .016 (= 0.05/3 for Bonferroni correction of three group comparisons). A cluster-extent threshold was evaluated by permutation test with 10,000 repetitions ( ). An abnormal resting-state functional connectivity found in this analysis was examined its change after the training sessions using a longitudinal analysis described below. \n\n\n### Longitudinal analysis for the training effect on abnormal connectivity \n  \nThe previous study ( ) identified altered connectivity across the PTSD, VC, and NC groups at baseline. The current study examined the effect of rtfMRI-nf training on these abnormal connectivities as well as on the LA connectivity. The training effect was examined by linear mixed-effect (LME) model analysis for longitudinal design. The LME model included fixed effects of session (baseline, post-training), group (PTSD-exp, PTSD-ctrl, VC-exp), session by group interaction, age, and motion size and a random effect of the subject on intercept. The LME analysis was performed with R language and environment for statistical computing (R  ) with nlme package ( ). Pairwise comparison of the groups was done within the LME fitted model by Tukey's multiple comparison method corrected by critical values from multivariate   t  -distribution with lsmeans package in R ( ). We also examined an LME model with additional regressors of symptom change and its interaction with session and group as fixed effects to search for a connectivity change that was associated with symptom change. The analysis for symptom association was done separately for each symptom measure only with the PTSD groups. The symptom association in each group within the LME fitted model was also tested with multiple comparison correction using critical values from multivariate   t  -distribution with lsmeans package in R ( ). All reported   p  -values for pairwise comparisons and the group-wise test were applied multiple testing correction. \n\nThe training effect on the neurofeedback target ROI was also examined in whole-brain voxels. The LME analysis was performed for all connectivities between the ROI and whole-brain voxels. The statistical parametric maps for the main effect of session and the interaction between session and group was thresholded by   p   < .005 voxel-wise and family-wise error correction by cluster-extent   p   < .05. Since a permutation test for the LME analysis was computationally too expensive, we used an improved cluster-size simulation with 3dClustSim in AFNI ( ). The new approach used an improved spatial autocorrelation function to simulate the null distribution of cluster size that remedies the false positive problem ( ). \n\n\n### Longitudinal MDMR for the connectome-wide training effect \n  \nA longitudinal MDMR analysis was performed for a comprehensive investigation of the training effect that was not limited to the abnormal connectivity at baseline. The longitudinal MDMR included the connectivity maps before and after the training for each subject. The distance matrix of these maps was the dependent variable in the MDMR. The design matrix was made following a longitudinal design example in   (example 6 in the appendix of  ). This design matrix included session, group (PTSD-exp, PTSD-ctrl, VC-exp), session by group interaction, age, and motion size. In addition, subject-wise factor variables were included in the design matrix. These regressors had 1 at a pair of a same subject's samples and 0 for the others. This could regress out subject-wise average effect, so that the longitudinal analysis could find the session and the group effect on within-subject connectivity difference. Exchangeability block of permutation test in the MDMR was defined for each subject. That is, permutation was performed within a subject to randomize session order and then subject blocks were randomly permuted. This permutation randomized the order of the sessions as well as the subject-group correspondence. \n\nWe found this design matrix was rank-deficient due to collinearity between the subject-wise regressors and age and motion regressors, which made the MDMR estimation unstable. We solved this problem by orthogonalizing the design matrix using singular value decomposition (SVD) ( ). The design matrix was decomposed to   X   =   USV   using SVD.   V   is a transpose of   V  . MDMR analysis can be described as   G   =   Xβ   =   USV   β   =   Uα  , where   G   is a centered negative distance matrix (  G   =   CAC  , where  ,  ,   n   is the number of subjects,   I   is the   n     ×     n   identity matrix and 1 is a vector of   n   1 s ( )) and   α   =   SV   β  . This transformation improved the stability of the analysis because columns of   U   are orthogonal to each other. Pseudo-  F   value can be evaluated by  , where   H   =   UU  . SVD does not change the total amount of variance in the design matrix and covariance between the design matrix and distance matrix ( ) so that this operation does not change the   F   value except by improving the stability of computation with avoiding a singular matrix. MDMR evaluates an individual effect of regressor using a partial design matrix,   X  , which is a design matrix excluding effects of interest columns. Pseudo-  F   value of the effect of interest is obtained by  , where   H   =   H   −   H  ,  ,   U   S   V   = SVD(  X  ), and   m   is the number of effects of interest regressors. We note that this procedure with SVD is equivalent to the original MDMR when the design matrix   X   is full-rank. \n\nThe processed resting-state fMRI image was down-sampled to 4mm  voxels to apply longitudinal MDMR. Significance of the pseudo-  F   value was evaluated by permutation test with 10,000 repeats and thresholded by   p   < .005 voxel-wise and family-wise error correction by cluster-extent   p   < .05. Cluster-extent threshold was evaluated by permutation test. The regions with a significant main effect of interest (sum of the effects of session, group, and the session by group interaction) in the MDMR were used as seed regions for post-hoc connectivity analysis. \n\nA seed-based post-hoc analysis for the significant regions with the MDMR was done in the original resolution images. Seed regions were placed at a peak location of the significant cluster in the MDMR statistical map for the main effect of interest. Peak coordinates in each significant cluster separated by at least 30 mm were extracted. Seed area was a 6 mm-radius sphere centered at the peak coordinates of the MDMR statistical map. Mean signal time-course of the seed area was used as a reference signal to calculate correlations with other voxels. The statistical test of the post-hoc analysis was the same as in the LA ROI analysis using LME and 3dClustSim. We also performed a longitudinal MDMR analysis with additional regressors of symptom change and its interaction with session and group to examine an association between connectivity change and symptom change. The analysis for symptom association was done separately for each symptom measure only with the PTSD groups. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Symptom measure \n  \nSymptom changes for PTSD patients have been reported in  . The present analysis complemented the previous report by checking to ensure that the rtfMRI-nf procedure did not increase PTSD symptoms for veterans without PTSD (VC group) as well as examining the influence of MDD comorbidity and training intervals. \n\n shows symptom levels at the baseline and the post-training sessions for the veterans who completed post-training resting-state session. Post-training CAPS scores were not available for five PTSD-exp, one PTSD-ctrl, and one VC participants. Supplementary fig. S2 shows symptom change across sessions. At baseline, significant differences were seen in between the VC and the PTSD groups (  p   < .01 for all measures in pairwise   t  -test) but there was no significant difference between the PTSD-exp and the PTSD-ctrl groups in any symptom scores.   \nSymptom measures at baseline and post-training sessions. \n  Table 1     \n\nLME longitudinal analysis showed a significant main effect of session on CAPS total scores (  χ  [1] = 10.257,   p   = .001 with type II analysis of deviance test ( )), CAPS Criterion C subscale (sub-C;   χ  [1] = 6.226,   p   = .013), CAPS Criterion D subscale (sub-D;   χ  [1] = 9.938,   p   = .002), PCL-M total symptom scores (  χ  [1] = 9.467,   p   = .002), MADRS (  χ  [1] = 7.150,   p   = .007), and HAM-A (  χ  [1] = 15.393,   p   < .001). Significant interaction between session and group was seen on CAPS total scores (  χ  [2] = 7.673,   p   = .022), CAPS sub-C (  χ  [2] = 7.350,   p   = .025), and CAPS sub-D (  χ  [2] = 7.795,   p   = .020). However, a follow-up pairwise comparison on the session effect showed no significant difference between the PTSD-exp and PTSD-ctrl groups in any symptom scores. This was consistent with the previous report that found no difference in average symptom change between exp. and ctrl groups for PTSD patients ( ). \n\nThe effect of MDD comorbidity (not including partial remitted MDD) on symptom change for the PTSD-exp group was also examined because the PTSD-exp group included participants with current MDD comorbidity while the PTSD-ctrl did not (see supplementary table S1). Significant interaction between session and MDD comorbidity was seen only on CAPS sub-D (  χ  [1] = 7.364,   p   = .007). Analysis of session effect for each group of PTSD with and without MDD comorbidity indicated that significant symptom reduction was seen for PTSD patients without MDD (  t  [9] = −4.808,   p   = .002) but not for PTSD patients with MDD (  t  [9] = −1.242,   p   = .418). \n\nThe effect of training intervals on symptom change was also examined by LME analysis with fixed effects of the session, the group, days between the last training session and the post assessment, their interaction as well as a random effect of participants on intercept. The analysis found no significant effect of interval length on symptom changes. \n\n\n### Connectivity in the neurofeedback target region \n  \nThe analysis showed that the PTSD group had significantly lower connectivity between the LA and the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) than the NC group.   shows the baseline group difference in the mean connectivity between the LA and the voxels in the left vlPFC cluster for the current study group who complete the post-training session. This connectivity was significantly lower for PTSD-exp compared to both NC (  t  [55] = −5.154,   p   < .001) and VC (  t  [55] = −2.639,   p   = .050). MDD comorbidity did not associated with this connectivity alteration in the PTSD-exp group (  t  [31] = 0.5001,   p   = .620). No other significant difference of LA connectivity between the groups was found in the baseline analysis. The same analysis for HIPS connectivity at baseline did not find significant difference between the groups.   \nThe region with significantly lower functional connectivity from the left amygdala ROI at the baseline session and its change between the sessions.

Connectivity values are z-transformed correlation coefficients residualized with regard to age and motion. \n  Fig. 1   \n\nLongitudinal LME analysis for the mean connectivity between the LA and the left vlPFC cluster showed tendency of main effect of session (  χ  [1] = 3.459,   p   = .063) but no significant interaction between session and group (  χ  [2] = 3.879,   p   = .144). Analysis for the session effect in each group showed a significant session effect only for the PTSD-exp group (  t  [29] = 2.554,   p   = .047). The connectivity was increased after the training for the PTSD-exp group ( ). This connectivity change, however, was not significantly associated with symptom change.   also indicated that the PTSD-exp group had lower baseline connectivity than the PTSD-ctrl group although the difference was not significant (  t  [55] = −2.152,   p   = .145). A whole-brain longitudinal analysis of the LA and HIPS connectivity with or without an effect of symptom change found no connectivity that was significantly associated with session and symptom change. \n\n\n### Training effects on abnormal resting-state functional connectivity \n  \nSupplementary material tables S4 and S5 show the altered connectivity for PTSD and VC compared to NC, respectively, at baseline that was identified in the previous study ( ). No significant difference between PTSD and VC was found in this study. \n\nA shows connectivity that had been altered in the PTSD group at baseline ( ) and showed a significant change after training. Connectivity between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) was significantly lower in the PTSD group compared to the NC group at baseline. Baseline analysis excluding the participants who did not complete the post-training session indicated that this connectivity was significantly low for PTSD-exp group compared to NC (  t  [55] = −5.196,   p   < .001) and VC-exp (  t  [55] = −4.203,   p   < .001) but there was no significant difference between PTSD-exp and PTSD-ctrl (  t  [55] = −1.272,   p   = .577) and between PTSD-ctrl and VC-exp (  t  [55] = −2.120,   p   = .155). Longitudinal LME analysis for the mean connectivity between the seed (SMA) and the voxels in the altered connectivity cluster at dACC showed significant main effect of session (  χ  [1] = 4.394,   p   = .036) but interaction between session and group was not significant (  χ  [2] = 4.328,   p   = .115). Analysis of the session effect for each group showed a significant increase of connectivity only for the PTSD-exp group (  t  [29] = 2.758,   p   = .029). This connectivity increase was significantly associated with a decrease of PCL-M in the PTSD-exp group ( B,   t  [15] = −3.092,   p   = .007) but not in the PTSD-ctrl group (  t  [15] = 1.262,   p   = .226). MDD comorbidity did not associate with the connectivity at baseline and its change after training.   \nTraining effect on abnormal connectivity for PTSD. A. Upper panels show seed location identified with MDMR (upper left) and abnormal connectivity region found in a post-hoc analysis of PTSD–NC contrast (upper right). Lower panels show mean connectivity between the seed and the voxels in the cluster of significantly altered connectivity at the baseline. The connectivity value was a z-transformed correlation with regressing out age and motion effects. Error bars show 95% confidence interval of the mean value. B. Association between the PCL-M score change and the connectivity change for PTSD participants are shown with fitted lines. Shadow around the line indicates the 95% confidence intervals of a fitted line. The connectivity change is the change in z-transformed correlations with regressing out age and motion effects. \n  Fig. 2   \n\n shows connectivity that had been altered for the VC group at baseline ( ) and showed a significant change after training. Connectivity between the left superior frontal region and the precuneus and the supramarginal gyrus was significantly low for the VC group compared to the NC group at baseline ( A). Baseline analysis excluding the participants who did not complete the post-training session indicated that this connectivity was significantly low for VC-exp compared to NC (  t  [55] = −5.443,   p   < .001) and PTSD-exp (  t  [55] = −2.904,   p   = .026). PTSD-exp also had lowered connectivity compared to NC (  t  [55] = −2.714,   p   = .041). Longitudinal LME analysis for the mean connectivity between the seed (left superior frontal region) and the voxels in the clusters of significantly altered connectivity showed significant main effect of session (  χ  [1] = 12.031,   p   < .001) but interaction between session and group was not significant (  χ  [2] = 3.66,   p   = .160). Analysis of the session effect in each group showed a significant session effect only for the VC-exp group (  t  [29] = 3.518,   p   = .004). This connectivity was increased after training for the VC-exp group ( A). All significant clusters for the left superior frontal seed connectivity had a similar connectivity pattern at baseline and its change after training (supplementary fig. S3).   \nTraining effect on abnormal connectivity for VC. For each panel A, B, and C, seed location (upper left) was identified with MDMR analysis and altered connectivity region (upper right) found in a post-hoc analysis of VC–NC contrast. Bar and line plots show mean connectivity between the seed and the voxels in the cluster of significantly altered connectivity at baseline. The connectivity value was a z-transformed correlation with regressing out age and motion effects. Error bars show the 95% confidence interval of the mean value. \n  Fig. 3   \n\nThe hyperconnectivity between the left insula seed and several brain areas for VC compared to NC has been identified in   at the baseline session ( B). Baseline analysis excluding the participants who did not complete the post-training session indicated that this connectivity was significantly high for VC-exp compared to NC (  t  [55] = 6.317,   p   < .001) and PTSD-exp (  t  [55] = 3.982,   p   = .001). PTSD-exp and PTSD-ctrl also had increased connectivity compared to NC (  t  [55] = 4.039,   p   < .001 and   t  [55] = 6.317,   p   < .001, respectively). This connectivity was significantly higher for PTSD-ctrl than PTSD-exp (  t  [55] = 3.304,   p   = .009), despite random assignment of the groups. Longitudinal LME analysis for the mean connectivity between the left insula seed and the voxels in the clusters of significantly altered connectivity showed significant main effect of session (  χ  [1] = 11.194,   p   = .004) and interaction between session and group (  χ  [2] = 11.354,   p   = .003). Analysis for the session effect in each group showed a significant session effect for the VC-exp group (  t  [29] = −3.990,   p   = .001) and for the PTSD-ctrl group (  t  [29] = −3.156,   p   = .011). For the PTSD-ctrl group, the decrease in this connectivity was associated with a decrease in CAPS sub-D (hyperarousal) symptoms ( B,   t  [10] = 2.754,   p   = .020). All significant clusters for the left insula seed connectivity had a similar connectivity pattern at baseline and its change after training (supplementary fig. S4). \n\nThe hyperconnectivity between the right insula seed and several brain areas for VC compared to NC has also been identified in   at the baseline session ( C). Baseline analysis excluding the participants who did not complete the post-training session indicated that this connectivity was significantly high for VC-exp compared to NC (  t  [55] = 8.388,   p   < .001) and PTSD-exp (  t  [55] = 4.606,   p   < .001). PTSD-exp and PTSD-ctrl also had increased connectivity compared to NC (  t  [55] = 4.015,   p   = .001 and   t  [55] = 4.290,   p   < .001, respectively). Longitudinal LME analysis for the mean connectivity between the right insula seed and the voxels in the clusters of significantly altered connectivity showed the significant main effect of session (  χ  [1] = 4.637,   p   = .031) and significant interaction between session and group (  χ  [2] = 9.466,   p   = .009). Analysis for the session effect in each group showed significant session effect only for VC-exp (  t  [29] = −3.485,   p   = .005). All significant clusters for the right insula seed connectivity had a similar connectivity pattern at baseline and its change after training (supplementary fig. S5). \n\n\n### Longitudinal MDMR for connectome-wide training effect \n  \nThe connectome-wide training effect that was not limited to baseline abnormality was examined using longitudinal MDMR analysis. The analysis, however, found no significant effect of session or interaction between session and group when no symptom change was included in the model. When the change in CAPS sub-D (hyperarousal) score was included in the analysis, longitudinal MDMR found a significant cluster in the right precuneus region for the sum of the effect of interest ( ). The LME analysis for the functional connectivity from this region revealed a significant interaction between session and CAPS sub-D score change (  χ  [1] = 14.150,   p   < .001) in the connectivity between the precuneus and the left superior frontal region ( ). The interaction between a change in CAPS sub-D score and group was not significant (  χ  [1] = 0.017,   p   = .897). The increase in this connectivity was significantly associated with a decrease in CAPS sub-D (hyperarousal) symptoms for the PTSD-exp group (  t  [10] = −4.192,   p   = .002). The PTSD-ctrl group also showed a similar trend (  t  [10] = −2.015,   p   = .072).   \nTraining effect on resting-state functional connectivity identified with longitudinal MDMR. Upper panels show seed location (upper left) identified with longitudinal MDMR and abnormal connectivity region (upper right) found in a post-hoc LME analysis for the interaction between the CAPS sub-D score change and the session. The bottom left panel shows mean connectivity between the seed and the voxels in a significant cluster. The connectivity value was z-transformed correlation with regressing out age and motion effects. Error bars show 95% confidence interval of the mean value. The bottom right panel shows the association between the CAPS sub-D change and the connectivity change for PTSD participants. The shadow around the line indicates the 95% confidence interval of a fitted line. The connectivity change is the difference in the z-transformed correlations with regressing out age and motion effects. \n  Fig. 4   \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nA comprehensive exploratory investigation of training effects on resting-state functional connectivity showed that changes in connectivity could be observed both in left amygdala connectivity as well as in the SMA, ACC, insula, precuneus, and prefrontal regions. These changes were in the direction of normalizing abnormal connectivity. Connectivity increases between the SMA and the dACC and between the precuneus and the left superior frontal gyrus were associated with a decrease in PTSD symptoms measured by PCL-M and CAPS sub-D (hyperarousal) symptoms, respectively. MDD comorbidity was only associated with changes in the CAPS hyperarousal symptoms. Reduction of this symptom cluster was significant for PTSD patients without MDD comorbidity but not for PTSD patients with MDD comorbidity. These results suggest that the current rtfMRI-nf training approach, which has demonstrated effects in reducing MDD symptoms ( ), could be effective in normalizing PTSD-related neurobiological functional alterations. The current results also suggested that the effect on resting-state functional connectivity could not be limited to the feedback target region and the training effect on those regions might be associated with symptom decreases. \n\nThere are, however, several open questions in this study such as: the observed baseline difference in functional connectivity between the PTSD-exp and PTSD-ctrl groups, the MDMR analysis found no significant difference between the PTSD-exp and the VC-exp groups, and the association between the connectivity normalization and symptom change. We also note that comprehensive exploratory analyses could increase the false positive rate. We discuss these issues focusing on the changes in resting-state functional connectivity and its association with symptom change. \n\n### Connectivity change in the neurofeedback target regions \n  \nThe PTSD group evidenced hypoconnectivity between the LA and the vlPFC region compared to the NC group at baseline. Amygdala hyperactivity both at rest ( ;  ;  ) and during negative emotion-inducing tasks ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) has been consistently reported for PTSD. This hyperactivity suggests a failure of emotion regulation that could be instantiated by hypoconnectivity between the amygdala and the prefrontal emotion-regulation regions, including the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) ( ;  ) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) ( ).   also reported decreased resting-state functional connectivity between the right basolateral amygdala (BLA) complex and the left inferior frontal gyrus for PTSD compared to trauma-exposed controls. The vlPFC has been linked to emotion regulation in many studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Taken together, the hypoconnectivity between the amygdala and the vlPFC was consistent with prior research, suggesting dysfunction of emotion regulation in PTSD related to deficient prefrontal activity and its hypoconnectivity with the amygdala. \n\nThe hypoconnectivity between the LA and left vlPFC was recovered after the training for the PTSD-exp group, while the HIPS region had no altered connectivity at baseline and no change of connectivity after training in any group. The connectivity change between the LA and left vlPFC may be more pronounced in emotion enhancement training than in emotion suppression training.   indicated that amygdala-vlPFC connectivity was increased during emotion acceptance and decreased during emotion suppression among people with anxiety disorders.   investigated a difference between responders and non-responders to exposure therapy for PTSD in baseline brain response to emotion reactivity and emotion reappraisal tasks. They found that treatment response was associated with high brain activation during an emotion-reactivity task but not associated with an emotion-reappraisal task. This suggests that the treatment effect was not mediated by a reappraisal of emotion, but by accepting and habituating to emotion. Our approach that trained subjects to enhance positive emotion did not involve efforts to suppress or reappraise emotion and, indeed, significant symptom reduction was observed. Taken together, these results suggest that neurofeedback procedures that involve emotion enhancement might be more effective for PTSD treatment than those that involve emotion suppression or reappraisal training. \n\nAlthough the connectivity increase was significant only for the PTSD-exp group, we could not conclude that the training effect was distinct to the LA neurofeedback. The PTSD-ctrl group had less hypoconnectivity than the PTSD-exp group at baseline that could affect the size of the training effect. This baseline difference was unfortunately emerged despite the use of random assignment to the group and could not be controlled, as we could not predict which participants would complete all sessions. \n\nThe LA connectivity change was not associated with PTSD symptom change. This indicated that symptom reduction effects of the rtfMRI-nf training may not be mediated by the modulation of the neurofeedback target region. In fact, we observed several resting-state connectivity changes in regions other than the LA, and some of those changes were associated with symptom reduction. This suggests that rtfMRI-nf training reduced symptoms not because of its localized effect in a target region, but because of the whole-brain co-modulating effect during the training. While the LA feedback signal could be useful for self-monitoring how well an emotional state is induced, there might be a better region to use for feedback in the treatment of PTSD, where activation or connectivity change is directly associated with symptom reduction. \n\n\n### Connectome-wide training effect \n  \nSeveral abnormal connectivities that had been identified in a connectome-wide analysis at baseline ( ) could be normalized after training. These include the increased connectivity between the SMA and the dACC, which showed hypoconnectivity for PTSD compared to NC at baseline ( A). The increase in this connectivity was significantly correlated with a decrease in PCL-M scores ( B). SMA and premotor regions have been consistently implicated as central nodes of the emotion regulatory network ( ;  ;  ).   suggested that the dorsal-caudal part of the ACC and medial PFC are involved in both expression and reappraisal of negative emotion.   used intracerebral electroencephalography to investigate SMA function in an action monitoring task. They indicated that SMA is a center of performance monitoring that detects errors in action and sends signals to other mPFC and ACC regions to drive action correction.   also showed that dACC activation was increased during emotion acceptance. Taken together, the lowered connectivity between the SMA and dACC at baseline for PTSD might be associated with a deficit in emotion representation and emotion monitoring. The current training approach, which encourages subjects to repeatedly recall memories that elicit positive emotion, may normalize neurobiological mechanisms involved in emotion representation. As a correlated symptom change was seen for the self-reporting PCL-M score - and not for clinician-evaluated CAPS - this connectivity change might be particularly associated with subjective symptom evaluation. Normalized emotion representation, especially for positive aspects of an emotional response, might help to improve a subjective view of the symptom state. \n\nAnother connectivity change that could be associated with symptom relief was between the precuneus and the left superior frontal gyrus. The increase in this connectivity was associated with the decrease in CAPS-measured hyperarousal symptoms. This association was discovered in the longitudinal MDMR analysis ( ) and no significant abnormality was found at baseline. This effect was found only with an analysis including the CAPS hyperarousal symptoms. This indicated that the connectivity change was not common for all PTSD participants but seen only for the participants with hyperarousal symptom reduction. Considering that both the PTSD-exp and the PTSD-ctrl groups showed the same association between the changes in connectivity and symptom, this connectivity change was not specific to the LA neurofeedback signal but might be associated with symptom reduction in general, regardless of the training procedure. We should, however, note that this result did not indicate that either feedback signal had the same therapeutic effect because the reduction in hyperarousal symptoms was significant only for PTSD-exp but not for PTSD-ctrl group ( ). \n\nThe precuneus has been implicated in memory retrieval, mental imagery, and self-related processing ( ;  ). A meta-analysis ( ) indicated consistent left superior frontal activity in emotion regulation tasks. The increase of this connectivity, therefore, might be due to repetitive positive memory retrieval during the training. Interestingly, the increase in this connectivity was associated with a decrease in PTSD symptoms, while previous studies indicated abnormal hyperactivity in the precuneus among people with PTSD ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ).   reported a positive correlation between the precuneus response to trauma-related pictures and subsequent PTSD symptom severity in acute stress disorder patients. Also, paroxetine treatment for PTSD has been shown to decrease resting-state amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation in the precuneus ( ). Collectively, these results suggest that elevated precuneus activity in PTSD is a pathological brain alteration. Although the increased connectivity between the precuneus and the superior frontal region could potentially enhance precuneus activity, this connectivity change was not associated with symptom increases, but rather decreases. This increase in connectivity might be associated with better control of precuneus activity or the pathological hyperactivity of the precuneus was specific to negative memories so that connectivity enhancement with positive memory retrieval may not have enhanced the abnormal activity. \n\nIt also warrants comment that the correlated symptom change was seen in CAPS-measured hyperarousal symptoms. This symptom measure consists of ‘difficulty in falling or staying asleep’, ‘irritability or outbursts of anger’, ‘difficulty in concentrating’, ‘hypervigilance’, and ‘exaggerated startle response.’ These symptoms might be associated with precuneus malfunction in memory retrieval, mental imagery, and self-related processing ( ;  ). Abrupt happenings of memory retrieval or self-related thought could disturb sleep and concentration and disrupted mental imagery could be associated with irritability, hypervigilance, and startle response. The increased connectivity between the precuneus and the left superior frontal gyrus might help better control on such abnormal activity. \n\nThe current results also showed that reduction in CAPS hyperarousal symptoms was significant specifically for PTSD patients without MDD comorbidity. MDD patients often show hyperconnectivity in the default mode network (DMN) ( ), and the precuneus is a core part of the DMN ( ). The DMN hyperconnectivity is considered to be related to maladaptive rumination in MDD ( ). The DMN malfunction with depression comorbidity might interfere with the connectivity change at the precuneus that could result in less reduction of hyperarousal symptoms for PTSD patients with MDD comorbidity. \n\nThe increase of precuneus connectivity after training was also observed for the VC group ( A). The VC group showed hypoconnectivity in the precuneus compared to NC at baseline ( ). It has been suggested that decreased precuneus activation is associated with efforts to terminate self-reflection of aversive sensations ( ;  ). The decreased connectivity in the precuneus for the VC group, therefore, could be adaptive in that it promotes healthy recovery by effectively suppressing retrieval of traumatic memories. The recovery of this connectivity might be considered a side effect of repetitive memory retrieval training. Importantly, however, no symptom change was seen for the VC group after the training. This also suggests that the increase of the precuneus connectivity did not enhance pathological activation. \n\nConnectivity normalization for the VC group was also seen in the bilateral insula regions ( B, C). The VC group had hyperconnectivity in these regions compared to NC at baseline ( ). This hyperconnectivity was normalized after training. These insula regions were more posterior areas than the anterior insula, which has been consistently reported as hyperactive among people with PTSD ( ;  ;  ). While the mid-to-posterior insula is a region implicated in proprioceptive sensation ( ;  ), its abnormality among people with PTSD has also been reported ( ;  ). A connectivity change in the posterior insula region with neurofeedback training was also reported in another rtfMRI-nf study.   performed rtfMRI-nf training for subjects with significant contamination anxiety to reduce orbitofrontal cortex activation while viewing a contamination-related image. They found reduced connectivity in the bilateral mid and posterior insula after training. These suggest that mid and posterior insula regions may also be responsive to emotional and cognitive tasks and a decreased insula connectivity might be a general effect of emotion regulation training. \n\nInterestingly, the PTSD-ctrl group, who had insula hyperconnectivity at baseline, also showed a decrease in this connectivity after training and its change was positively correlated with CAPS hyperarousal symptom change ( B). This also suggests that a change in insula connectivity might not be specifically associated with the neurofeedback signal. The association between the connectivity and symptom reduction, however, is perplexing because hyperconnectivity in both the VC and the PTSD-ctrl groups at baseline suggested this connectivity was not associated with PTSD symptom, while the positive correlation between the changes in connectivity and symptoms suggested an association. We note that we cannot draw definitive conclusions from this result because the number of participants in the PTSD-ctrl group was small. However, this might indicate that baseline abnormality is not necessarily associated with observed symptoms and symptom reduction effects could be seen in the connectivity that is not associated with a symptom levels at baseline. The increased insula connectivity would not be associated with PTSD symptoms as the VC group evidenced this pattern at baseline. A decrease of this connectivity, however, might reduce PTSD symptoms. How such connectivity change works for symptom reduction remains unknown, but the current results with longitudinal MDMR also indicated that a connectivity change that was associate with symptom reduction was observed in a connectivity that was not abnormal at baseline ( ). Although the implication of normalizing insula hyperconnectivity is not entirely clear, it is important that no exacerbation of PTSD symptoms was observed for the VC participants and even a correlated symptom reduction was seen for the PTSD-ctrl group. \n\n\n### Connectivity difference between veterans with and without PTSD \n  \nThe connectome-wide analysis at baseline ( ) did not reveal significant connectivity differences between veterans with PTSD versus without PTSD (VC). The current longitudinal MDMR analysis also did not find significant differences between the PTSD and the VC groups. A similar non-significant difference in resting-state connectivity between veterans with and without PTSD has been reported by  . They found no significant difference in the DMN resting-state connectivity between veterans with PTSD and combat-exposed controls but found significant differences between veterans and never-traumatized healthy controls. This indicated that combat exposure could alter resting-state connectivity regardless of the presence of PTSD. \n\nWe, however, note that no statistically significant difference does not necessarily indicate group equivalence. We observed alterations of resting-state functional connectivity specifically to either the PTSD or VC groups compared to the NC ( ). In addition, abnormality of resting-state connectivity could have large variability within a group that limits the sensitivity to see group differences. In fact, the baseline difference between the PTSD-exp and PTSD-ctrl groups indicated that the abnormality in the group was not homogeneous. We also note that the non-significant difference could be due to limited sensitivity of MDMR analysis, which is discussed in the next section. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe major limitation of the current study was the small number and biased sample of PTSD-ctrl participants who completed the training sessions. Despite random assignment, there were large baseline differences between the PTSD-exp and the PTSD-ctrl groups in functional connectivities (e.g.  B). We could not control for this group difference because we could not predict which participants would complete the feedback sessions. Due to this limitation, inferences regarding the specificity of training effects resulting from left amygdala-focused neurofeedback remain tentative. Training effects may not be specific to the neurofeedback but rather due to positive autobiographical memory recall. However, prior work has documented that positive memory recall did not improve mood ratings for depressed individuals ( ), suggesting that in the current study positive memory recall alone would not likely reduce symptoms. It is possible that the neurofeedback signal could enhance induction of a positive emotional state, which would explain why more patients showed symptom reduction in the PTSD-exp group compared to the PTSD-ctrl group ( ). \n\nWe should also note a limited statistical significance due to a comprehensive exploratory approach in this research. Although the abnormal connectivity was identified with a stringent whole-brain correction in our previous study ( ), the present analysis for the longitudinal effect was not corrected for multiple testing among the connectivities. The longitudinal MDMR analysis, while applied a stringent whole-brain correction, was also performed for several symptom scales. The present results, therefore, should be considered tentative and need further confirmation in future work. Notwithstanding the limited significance, we think the results of this exploratory analysis merit considerations because they may point to novel hypothesis for future confirmatory research. \n\nA limited sensitivity of the longitudinal MDMR analysis also merits comment. Indeed, while the ROI analysis for left amygdala connectivity detected significant hypoconnectivity for PTSD at baseline, this was not detected in the MDMR analysis ( ). Also, significant connectivity changes that were detected when we focused on abnormal connectivities at baseline were not detected by the longitudinal MDMR. These dissociations suggest limited sensitivity of the MDMR analysis. Limited sensitivity was also due to an MDMR analysis mechanism. The MDMR evaluates between-subject distance of connectivity maps and this distance measure could be relatively insensitive to connectivity change between small regions because it summarizes the differences in a large dimensional connectivity map into one measure. The distance measure is also insensitive to how connectivity maps differ so that the same distance could be derived from different changes in connectivity patterns. These limitations could explain the dissociation between the results of ROI-based analysis and MDMR analysis. We need to note that a non-significant result of MDMR should not be interpreted as strong evidence of a negative finding. As there is no perfect analysis to investigate changes in whole-brain connectivity, the present study performed analyses for the amygdala ROI, pre-identified abnormal connectivity, and whole-brain connectome-wide. \n\nWe also did not consider individual variability of training success in the training sessions for the resting-state analysis. Including such variability might improve the sensitivity of the analysis to detect the effect of training on resting-state connectivity. We note, however, that since the treatment effect could be associated with brain regions other than the neurofeedback target region, training success might not be defined only by the regulation of the feedback target region. We will require further comprehensive investigation to elucidate the association between the brain activation during the training and changes in symptom and resting-state connectivity. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nComprehensive investigations for the effect of rtfMRI-nf training to increase left amygdala activity with positive memory retrieval on resting-state functional connectivity suggested that the training effect was not restricted to the feedback target region but could be seen in multiple connectivities that were associated with emotion regulation and memory retrieval, including the lateral prefrontal cortex, SMA, dACC, precuneus, and posterior insula regions. A connectome-wide approach using MDMR enables exploratory analysis of connectivity. Despite the limited sensitivity of MDMR, this approach is promising for connectome-wide investigation of training effects on brain functional connectivity. Interestingly, the symptom reduction did not appear due to a connectivity change in the amygdala, but rather due to connectivities between the SMA and dACC and between the precuneus and the left anterior frontal region. This suggests a neurofeedback effect on symptoms may be due to a larger brain network than only the targeted region. While these results need to be confirmed by further confirmatory researches, they may provide valuable insight into the treatment effect on the whole brain resting-state connectivity. \n\nThe connectivity changes suggested in this study might involve correcting emotion representation and memory retrieval. Such an effect could be promoted by positive emotion enhancement training rather than suppressing or reappraising negative emotions. Many rtfMRI-nf treatment studies have focused on decreasing abnormal activity ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, promoting positive emotional experience might help correct abnormal emotion representation and could have the same, if not more of, a therapeutic effect in treating the biological underpinnings of dysregulated emotion and mood disorder symptoms ( ). Future development of rtfMRI-nf training methods may benefit from further testing of training approaches that promote healthy emotional brain responses rather than suppress abnormal responses. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"bf289bffd2556a2bb0b5a1ae0a0f7737"},

An early diagnostic classification among these subtypes is not possible based on a new-onset tic symptom. Machine learning tools have been widely used for early diagnostic classification based on functional MRI (fMRI). However, few machine learning models have been built for the diagnostic classification of patients with TD. Therefore, in the present study, we will provide a study protocol that uses the machine learning model to make early classifications of the three different types of TD. \n\n\n## Methods and analysis \n  \nWe planned to recruit 200 children aged 6–9 years with new-onset tic symptoms and 100 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls under resting-state MRI scanning. Based on the neuroimaging data of resting-state fMRI, the support vector machine (SVM) model will be built. We planned to construct an SVM model based on functional connectivity for the early diagnosis classification of TD subtypes (including PTD, CMT/CVT, TS). \n\n\n## Ethics and dissemination \n  \nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of Beijing Children’s Hospital.

It has been reported that 0.2%–46.3% of children experience tics in their lifetime.  TD can be categorised into three subtypes based on the symptoms (motor tics or vocal tics) and the duration of symptom persistence. The subtypes include provisional TD (PTD), chronic motor or vocal TD, and Tourette syndrome (TS).  Notably, different subtypes of TD might require different treatments.  Therefore, early diagnostic classification has been regarded as one of the most important clinical issues that need to be addressed. \n\nHowever, the current classification of TD can only be diagnosed through retrospective interviews based on the symptoms and duration.  Therefore, it is now impossible to judge the classification  and prognosis  of TD based on a new-onset tic symptom. In other words, there is now no way to make an early diagnostic classification when tic symptoms first appear. \n\nThe development of MRI provides new insight into the pathophysiology of TD. The sensory discomfort of TD is related to abnormalities in white matter in the orbitofrontal cortex.  In addition, the core features of TD seem to be the abnormal cortex-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit (CSTC).  The subtypes of TD and TS show structural abnormalities in the supplementary motor area, somatosensory cortex, premotor cortex, limbic system and basal ganglia.  Furthermore, patients with TS show abnormal functional connectivity (FC) between the striatum, thalamus, primary motor cortex and sensory cortex.  Therefore, neuroimaging abnormalities could be promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of TD. \n\nRecently, radiomics has shown great potential in aiding clinical diagnosis by analysing medical images.  In radiomics analysis, features are extracted from high-throughput image data, and machine learning methods can be used to analyse these features to build different models to support clinical decision-making.  Radiomics had already been used in helping the diagnosis of psychiatric diseases.  Indeed, several studies have begun to use machine learning in the diagnosis of TD.  One study used support vector machine (SVM) based on functional MRI (fMRI) data to identify children with TS among healthy controls with an accuracy of 74%.  Another study also reported an SVM model for identifying patients with TS from healthy controls with high accuracy and sensitivity (accuracy=92.86%, sensitivity=91.67%).  SVM is one of the most commonly used models for the diagnosis of TD, and it will also be ‘suitable’ for the classification of different subtypes of TD. \n\nTherefore, this protocol aims to use SVM to identify patients with PTD, chronic TD and TS based on the fMRI data. It would be useful for clinicians to use a predictive model to make an early diagnosis of the three different types of TD. \n\n\n## Methods and analysis \n  \nThis is a single-centre study that will be carried out at the Department of Psychiatry in Beijing Children’s Hospital (China). The participants will be enrolled consecutively. The inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria will be developed to identify individuals who meet these criteria. This project was approved and monitored by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Children’s Hospital. Written informed consent will be obtained from the participant and/or their guardian before they are included in this study. This study is supported by the Special Fund of the Pediatric Medical Coordinated Development Center of Beijing Hospitals Authority (No. XTYB201802). \n\n### Recruitment of participants \n  \nThe recruitment period will last between 1 June 2020 and 30 June 2021. All the participants will be recruited in the Department of Psychiatry of Beijing Children’s Hospital of Capital Medical University. Outpatients who show new-onset tic symptoms will be recruited to participate in this study. Flyer of this study is posted in the waiting room in the Department of Psychiatry in Beijing Children’s Hospital. The clinician in the department will introduce the study to patients who fulfilled the requirements of this study. The healthy controls will be recruited from a local primary school with long-term cooperation. Informed consent will be obtained from the children and/or their legal guardians. \n\n\n### Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria for included participants \n  \nThe inclusion criteria of patients with TD are as follows: (1) aged 6–9 years; (2) Chinese Han nationality; (3) tic symptoms appearing during the past 3 months; (4) fulfilled the diagnosis of TD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5); (5) never used any drugs to ease tic symptoms; (6) left-handed and (7) IQ higher than 80. \n\nThe exclusion criteria of patients with TD are as follows: (1) a comorbid diagnosis of schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder based on screening of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version (Kiddie-SADS-PL) ; (2) tic symptoms longer than 1 year; (3) epilepsy and other neurological diseases or serious physical condition; and (4) antipsychotic use during the past 3 months for treatment. \n\nFor the healthy control group, the inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) matched with the tic patients in age, gender and IQ; and (2) ruled out the diagnosis of any mental disorder based on the screening of Kiddie-SADS-PL. The exclusion criteria were (1) any psychiatric or neurological disease and (2) having taken antipsychotics during the past 3 months for treatment. \n\nThere is no consensus about the methods to calculate the sample size needed in machine learning. However, based on previous studies, the machine learning model showed great accuracy in differentiating patients with mental disorders from healthy controls with sample sizes between 150 and 200.  Furthermore, we summarise some previous studies based on SVM to differentiate patients with TS from healthy controls in  . Considering that there might be some drop-off during the follow-up study, we decided to recruit 200 children with tic symptoms in our study. In addition, we plan to enrol 100 patients in this study. \n  \nExamples of the application of SVM based on the radiomics in TS \n    \n\n### Neuroimaging data collection \n  \nAll participants will be scanned using an MR750 3.0T scanner (General Electric Company) at the Department of Radiology in Beijing Children’s Hospital. First, a three-dimensional magnetisation prepared rapid gradient echo sequence will be used to acquire T1-weighted images, and its parameters are listed: TR=2530 ms, TE=2.34 ms, TI=1100 ms, resolution=256×256, flip angle=7, slices=176 and slice thickness=1 mm. The T1 sequence lasted for 649 s. After T1-weighted image acquisition, all participants will also undergo T2-weighted image scans that lasted for 60 s to exclude incidental central nervous system diseases. We will acquire resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scans by T2-weighted echo planar imaging with the following parameters: TR=2500 ms, TE=21 ms, slices=42, flip angle=90, slice thickness=35, field of view=200 mm, resolution=64×64, voxel size=3.1×3.1×3.5 mm and bandwidth=2520 Hz/Px. \n\n\n### Neuroimaging data preprocessing \n  \nThe rs-fMRI data will be preprocessed using the Data Processing & Analysis for Brain Imaging ( ). It will be preprocessed as in a previous study,  and the detailed steps are listed below: \n  \nThe first 10 images were removed to reduce the potential noise. \n  \nCorrection for temporal differences: as each slice acquired at different times, all slices were corrected for time offsets so that every TR was the same in the acquisition time. \n  \nCorrection for head movement: co-registration of each TR and each slice, and parameters for the head position include translational and rotational displacements along the X, Y, and Z axes, neither translation nor rotation parameters in any given data set exceeded ±3 mm or ±3°. \n  \nExclude the subject who had head movement over the 3 mm and 3° in max. \n  \nSegment T1 images into grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. \n  \nCo-registration of the T1 images to functional images. \n  \nSpace normalisation: the T1 image data, and functional data will be normalised to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using first linear and then non-linear transformation. After being normalised to the MNI template, the functional images will then be resampled to 3×3×3 mm  resolution. \n  \nSpace smoothing: the image data are smoothed with 4×4×4 mm  full widths at half maximum to reduce the individual difference after normalisation. \n  \nCorrect for linear trends: 0.01–0.08 Hz temporally bandpass filtering to reduce high-frequency physiological noise and low-frequency noise using temporal filtering. \n  \n\n### Machine learning classification \n  \nMachine learning enables a computer to recognise feature data without being explicitly programmed. The key part of machine learning lies in pattern recognition. The main process includes (1) extracting and selecting feature classification, (2) constructing a predictive model and (3) assessing the generalisation ability of the predictive model. \n\nAfter the preprocessing of neuroimaging data, we plan to use principal component analysis to analyse the rs-fMRI data. After this step, dozens of features of different subtypes of TD can be extracted. These features will then be used for machine learning classification. As listed in  , SVM is a widely used classification method used in the study of neuropsychiatric diseases.  It is an algorithm used to recognise patterns. SVM has constructed space with maximum margin, in which different data classes can be separated. SVM classification is an algorithm with high accuracy and generalisation ability. In our study, we mainly use a machine learning algorithm based on the SVM algorithm. Both the linear SVM and SVM recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) will be used. In addition to the SVM algorithm, we also plan to use the multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity will be calculated as the evaluation parameter of the SVM model. \n\nIn this study, we use 10-fold cross-validation to assess the generalisability.  The data set of all the participants will be randomly split into 10 parts; nine parts of the data set will be chosen as training data used as an SVM model, and the remaining part will serve as a test data set to test the classification ability of this model. Specifically, for all 200 participants, after preprocessing the neuroimaging data, their rs-MRI data will give a new sample ID from 1 to 300. Then, 30 random numbers are generated. These 30 participants are designated the validation set, while the remaining 270 participants served as the training set. The functional network properties of these 270 participants are used to train the SVM model. The feature will be selected using only data from the training set. Then, the validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the SVM model. By repeating these procedures 10 times, the model with ‘optimal’ results was chosen, and the average accuracy is calculated.  The procedure of the whole study is listed in  . \n  \nThe procedure for building the SVM model. ALFF, altered amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation; CTD, chronic tic disorder; FC, functional connectivity; PTD, provisional tic disorder; ReHo, regional homogeneity; rs-fMRI, resting-state functional MRI; SVM, support vector machine; TS, Tourette syndrome. \n  \n\n### Clinical measurements \n  \nThe questionnaire includes demographic data such as age and gender. It also includes items about the structure and function of the family, such as the occupation of parents, their education level, age, the relationship between husband and wife, type of family education, etc. Perinatal data include parental age during pregnancy, and whether parents smoked, drank alcohol, went through physical disease, and took medication during pregnancy. Growth and development data will be recorded, such as language and motor development, and history of organic diseases such as brain tumours, brain trauma, convulsions, carbon monoxide poisoning and night terrors. These are all factors that might be associated with the onset of TD. \n\nTic symptom severity will be rated by the widely used Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).  YGTSS is a clinician-rated scale to measure the severity of motor and vocal tic symptoms. Tic symptoms will be evaluated by observation of the children and interviewing children and their parents about the number, frequency, intensity, complexity and interference of tic symptoms. For every domain mentioned above, a 0–5 score is used, with 0 indicating there is no tic and 5 indicating the most severe condition in the domain. The Chinese version was translated by Youquan Zhong   et al   and was proven to have good reliability and validity. \n\nThe Premonitory Urges for Tics Scale (PUTS) is a self-reported scale to assess premonitory urge; it contains nine sentences to describe unpleasant sensory phenomena during the tic. It is a 4-point scale, where 1 stands for ‘not at all true’, while 4 stands for ‘very much true’.  The total PUTS score showed a strong association with tic severity.  Our group worked with the author of PUTS and translated it into Chinese, and we were working on testing the reliability and validity of the PUTS-Chinese version. PUTS was used to assess premonitory urges in this study. \n\nThe Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) is a clinician-rated scale to evaluate the global symptom severity of mental disorders. It is a subjective evaluation based on a clinician’s experience of the disease. CGI uses 7-point measures to assess the severity of illness if the patient ‘normal, not at all ill’ is rated 1, and if he or she is considered ‘extremely ill,’ 7 is chosen.  In this study, CGI was used as a supplement to YGTSS to evaluate tic symptom severity. \n\nChildren and their parents will complete a demographic data format and the self-reported PUTS together. Clinicians on the research team perform YGTSS and CGI. The clinicians (n=3) in this study were trained to finish the evaluation of the YGTSS, PUTS and CGI. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is good (ICC ≥0.85). The clinical assessments will be performed at four time points (baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months). The measurements at every time point are listed in  . \n  \nMeasurements at each follow-up time point \n    \n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nWe plan to use independent-sample t-tests and Χ  tests to analyse the demographic and clinical data. The age and IQ difference between the TD group and the healthy control group will be compared using independent-sample t-tests. The Χ  test will be used to compare the sex ratio between the two groups. Similar to previous studies, we will use the two-sample t-test to compare the rs-fMRI data between the TD group and the healthy control group. For significant changes in the FC network in the TD group, Pearson’s correlation will be performed to calculate their correlation with the YGTSS and PUTS scores. We plan to use SVM-RFE to extract features from the processed rs-fMRI. \n\n\n### Primary and secondary outcomes \n  \n#### Primary outcome \n  \nThe main purpose of our study was to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in the classification of TD. Therefore, the primary outcomes will be listed as the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve of the prediction model based on the SVM, SVM-RFE and MKL algorithms. \n\n\n#### Secondary outcomes \n  \nThe FC difference between patients with TD and healthy controls will be reported as the secondary outcome. The correlation between significant FC changes and clinical severity will also be explored. \n\n\n\n### Patient and public involvement \n  \nDepending on the patients’ priorities, experience and preferences, the development of the research question and outcome measures will be explained by analysing fMRI with machine learning, which will be used to make a classification diagnosis of TD by the time the tic symptom first appeared. During the study design phase, patients will not be involved, and during the recruitment and implementation phase of the study, the concerns and questions of patients will be addressed by clinical doctors. The trial results will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals for publication. \n\n\n### Ethics and dissemination \n  \nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of Beijing Children’s Hospital. The trial results will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals for publication. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nMachine learning is an important field in artificial intelligence. It has been widely used in analysing the neuroimaging data of psychiatric patients and shows great potential in the diagnosis, prognosis prediction and treatment outcome prediction of psychiatric disease.  SVM is the most common method used in machine learning.  SVM enabled computers to discover the patterns of neuroimaging data in a supervised way.  It can be applied to analyse a variety of neuroimaging data, such as rs-fMRI data,  diffusion tensor imaging data  or diffusion-weighted imaging data,  and shows high accuracy in differentiating psychiatric patients from healthy controls. In the present study, the SVM was used to build a predictive model to classify the three types of TD based on fMRI data. If this model shows good accuracy for the diagnoses of different types of disorders, it will be beneficial for clinicians to make better clinical choices for the treatment of TD. \n\nAccording to the current diagnostic criteria (such as DSM-5), any new-onset tics were diagnosed as PTD. However, no biomarker predicts the prognosis of PTD, specifically whether it persists or not. This finding suggested that some symptoms include the presence of subsyndromal autism spectrum symptoms and anxiety disorder, and reward suppression of tic symptoms may be associated with the prognosis of PTD.  Therefore, many ‘risk factors’ might influence the development of tic symptoms. Among these factors, premonitory urges (PUs) seem to be the most important  because they positively correlate with the severity of tic symptoms.  Future studies should pay more attention to the association between PU and the development of tic symptoms. \n\nFurthermore, further studies are required to investigate how these ‘important risk factors’ influence the development of tic symptoms. New techniques such as structural or functional MRI might provide new insight into these research mechanisms because TD is a neurodevelopmental disease with structural abnormalities in the supplementary motor area, somatosensory cortex, premotor cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia and network connectivity of the CSTC.  Therefore, these brain structural and functional abnormalities may serve as biomarkers in the diagnosis of different types of TD. Several studies use SVM to differentiate patients with TS from healthy controls based on fMRI data, which indicates that SVM might be the most suitable algorithm to analyse the rs-fMRI data and build the predictive model. No study has explored the application of SVM in the classification of different subtypes of TD. This study is the first to explore the accuracy of SVM in the early diagnostic classification of TD. \n\nAlthough several studies use SVM to differentiate patients with TS from healthy controls,  our protocol deserves to be considered for the following reasons. First, this protocol describes the detailed procedures to build a predictive model by SVM, such as how to acquire and preprocess MRI data. Second, our study has a larger sample size than other SVM classification studies. Third, we outline the steps in constructing a functional network and SVM classification, which is easy for other research teams to replicate our procedure and validate our model in other data. Last, we recruited only drug-naive children with PTD and ruled out medication confounders. \n\nTwo limitations exist in this study. First, tic symptoms might be suppressed when there were other people around, and videotape with children alone in the room is a more objective way to observe tic expression.  Second, we only have rs-fMRI data in the predictive model, and multimodal MRI data should be considered in future studies. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"a32d948c00ef6d5699b5b4a5e6a000a2"},

But some of the MCI patients may further develop into severe statuses like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The brain functional connectivity network (BFCN) was usually constructed from the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. This technology has been widely used to detect the neurodegenerative dementia and to reveal the intrinsic mechanism of neural activities. The BFCN edge was usually determined by the pairwise correlation between the brain regions. This study proposed a weighted voting model of multi-source connectivity networks (MuscNet) by integrating multiple BFCNs of different correlation coefficients. Our model was further improved by removing redundant features. The experimental data demonstrated that different BFCNs contributed complementary information to each other and MuscNet outperformed the existing models on detecting MCI patients. The previous study suggested the existence of multiple solutions with similarly good performance for a machine learning problem. The proposed model MuscNet utilized a weighted voting strategy to slightly outperform the existing studies, suggesting an effective way to fuse multiple base models. The reason may need further theoretical investigations about why different base models contribute to each other for the MCI prediction. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most dangerous and frequently-occurred brain diseases, and this irreversible neuro-degenerative dementia remains to have no effective treatments [ ]. AD may develop from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which has become the investigation focus of the AD researchers [ ]. According to [ ], the functionally alive brain may be modeled as a graph, with the functional brain regions (also called region of interest, or ROI) as nodes and significant correlations between nodes as edges, which are calculated using the time series data of bloodoxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals of each ROI. Such a network was defined as the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) and was expected to reveal intrinsic mechanisms about BFCNs, etc[ ]. The static Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)-based BFCN has demonstrated promising predicting performances on the diagnosis of MCI, AD and a few other diseases [ ]–[ ]. The partial time series data of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals were used to represent the temporary graph nodes and to construct the dynamic BFCN [ ], [ ]. \n\nThe above-mentioned network was regarded as the low-order BFCN and in [ ], the high-order version BFCN (HON) was constructed by calculating weighted-graph local clustering coefficients as the features of brain regions. In [ ], dynamic versions of low-order (LoM) and high-order BFCNs (HiO) were constructed simultaneously using Matrix Variate Normal Distribution (MVND), and a fusion model (FuMO) integrating both low-order and high-order BFCN was further proposed. Although the high order BFCN demonstrated better diagnosis performance on neurodegenerative dementia [ ], researches in [ ] indicated that the integration of both low-order and high-order BFCNs may complement each other and facilitate a better diagnosis result. \n\nBrain is a comprehensive and dynamic network of ROIs and may be formulated by various versions of BFCNs through different definitions of the edges including HON [ ], FuMO [ ], sparse network [ ], ICA [ ], etc. Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was the most popular formulation of the ROI edges for its simplicity and effectiveness. Due to the PCC’s limitation on describing the non-linear correlation, various other inter-variable similarity metrics were introduced to define the edges, e.g. Kendall correlation coefficient (KCC) [ ,  ], Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) [ ], and cosine similarity (CS) [ ], etc. The correlation metrics maximal information coefficient (MIC) has been proven to have outstanding performance in capturing both linear and nonlinear relationships between two variables [ ] and has been successfully applied to connectivity network construction [ ] and schizophrenia disease detection [ ]. \n\nConsidering that brain functional network cannot be modeled simply using one correlation coefficient, integrated modeling of different BFCNs may improve the disease diagnosis performances. In [ ], the correlation’s correlation of multiple levels of high-order BFCNs were calculated and the linear fusion of those BFCNs in different levels facilitated an important improvement in the computational diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders. Relevant conclusion in [ ] showed that a multi-task intrinsic network fusing within- and between-task interactions of patients and controls extracted by general linear model (GLM) and ICA can improve the schizophrenia diagnosis. However, those works only applied the traditional tool like PCC and ICA for the base model, which may be limited. \n\nThis study hypothesized that the sensitive correlation metrics MIC may capture hidden information from the noisy brain rs-fMRI data compared to other traditional coefficients, and the combination of MIC and other coefficients may improve the diagnosis. Inspired by the above works, we presented a new data fusion method considering the BFCNs constructed by various correlation coefficients as data source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of utilizing MIC as the correlation metrics in the BFCN construction for MCI diagnosis and the first work of combining BFCNs with different correlation measuring metrics. Furthermore, considering the computational challenge of the large feature number of a BFCN, we explored the effects of different feature selection methods on the MCI prediction performance. Our experimental data demonstrated that the MCI diagnosis may be improved by integrating multiple correlation metrics and selecting appropriate features. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### DATASET SUMMARY \n  \nThis study used the publicly available neuro-imaging dataset from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database [ ]. ADNI is a longitudinal multi-center consortium aiming to accumulate and provide the clinical, imaging, genetics and biochemical datasets for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). After a decade’s ongoing effort, the ADNI database released to the public researchers with the multiple types of neuro-imaging data and other clinical information. ADNI has served as a major data source for the researchers of detecting the onset and progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [ ], [ ]. \n\nThis study used the same dataset as in [ ], including 68 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and 69 Normal Controls (NC) from the ADNI database. The rs-fMRI of these participants were scanned by 3.0T Philips MRI scanner. The following scanner settings were utilized: TR/TE = 3000/30 mm, flip angle = 80 , imaging matrix size = 64 * 64, 48 slices and 140 volumes, and slice thickness = 3.3mm. Each rs-fMRI image data was processed by the following well-accepted protocol using the software SPM8, which is available at  . In order to make a consistent comparison, the samples were selected using the same criteria as the study [ ]. \n\nThe first three volumes of each participant were discarded to ensure the magnetization equilibrium. The rest 137 volumes of each participant were then pre-processed with correction and normalization. The rs-fMRI imaging data was regressed to reduce the effects of nuisance signals including ventricle, white matter signals and six head-motion profiles. The Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template atlas [ ] was utilized to divide the generated Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time series signals into 116 regions of interest (ROIs). Finally, the mean rs-fMRI time series signals of each ROI (consisting of 137 volumes) were band-pass filtered from 0.01 to 0.08 Hz to generate the data matrix of each participant for constructing BFCN. The pre-processed data was provided by [ ]. \n\n\n### CONSTRUCTION OF MuscNet \n  \nThis study constructed a multi-source connectivity network (MuscNet) by integrating four classic metrics for measuring linear correlation coefficients (CC), including PCC, SCC, KCC and CS, and the sensitive metrics MIC, as illustrated in  . PCC was considered as equivalent to the decentralized CS. Both SCC and KCC were non-linear tolerant. \n\n#### STATIC BFCN \n  \nThe correlation   between ROI  and ROI  of subject n was defined as follows:\n \n\nwhere corr() can be replaced by one specific correlation coefficient metrics. Taking PCC and MIC as examples, respectively.   may calculated as:\n \n\nwhere   was defined as the m  element in BOLD time series signal vector of ROI  of subject n. And   may be calculated as:\n \n\nwhere I(V ,V ) was the mutual information between V  and V , and H(V ) was the Shannon information entropy of the variable V . The calculation of the MIC and the Shannon information entropy were implemented as the function MINE() in the Python package minepy version 1.2.3 [ ]. After pre-processing, we can obtain a data matrix with shape (num , num , num ), where num  = 137, num  = 137, num  = 116, meant that each subject had 137 volumes, each volume included 116 BOLD signals corresponding to each ROI. We can also transpose it into (num , num , num ), which meant each ROI had a BOLD signal vector with length num . Then the basic correlation based BFCN can be constructed as follows: 1) Calculate pairwise correlation coefficient   of all subjects. 2) Concatenate all   of one subject into a square matrix with shape (num , num ), which was called BFCN correlation square. 3) Flatten the BFCN correlation square, and get the BFCN correlation feature vector F  of each subject with length (num  * num ).   illustrated the BFCN correlation matrices based on PCC and MIC. As for the BFCN correlation matrices based on other correlation coefficients, corresponding illustration can be found in   due to the page limit. \n\n\n#### DYNAMIC BFCN \n  \nThis study extracted the following number of sliding-window segments from the whole time series signal:\n \n\nwhere window  is the length of each window, and window  is the distance between two successive windows. For example, if window  = 50, window  = 8, the 137 volumes may be converted to 11 segments to construct 11 temporal BFCNs. Following the same procedure as in static BFCN construction, we can produce num  temporal BFCN correlation squares. Then the average of these num  temporal correlation squares will be flattened as the dynamic BFCN correlation feature vector DF  of each subject. As similar to [ ], window  was set to (50, 70, 90, 110), while the range of window  was (1, 2, 4, 8, 10), respectively. \n\n\n#### MUSCNET \n  \nInspired by the previous works [ ], [ ], [ ] using data fusion to improve the model performance, we constructed MuscNet by integrating multiple estimators trained by dynamic BFCNs based on different correlation coefficient metrics. The whole construction was as follows: 1) Divide the whole time series signals into several segments by sliding-window. 2) For each segment, get the corresponding BFCN correlation feature vector F  of each subject. 3)Train the estimator group by F s corresponding to various correlation coefficients. 4) Fuse the estimator pairwise. Specifically, the decision scores from each pair of estimators generated from the above process were linearly fused by a weighting parameter   α  , which ranges from 0.1 to 0.9 with step 0.1. So MuscNet is a weighted voting strategy to fusing multi-source connectivity networks. For illustration purposes, each MuscNet may be described with the two correlation coefficient metrics. For example, “PCC&MCC” represented the MuscNet combining the estimator using PCC with the estimator using MCC. \n\n\n\n### FEATURE SELECTION METHODS \n  \nThis study utilized three popular filter algorithms to select features for the binary classification problem of MCI and NC samples. Ttest is the most popular feature selection algorithm [ ] and has demonstrated its effectiveness on the AD diagnosis [ ]. Wilcoxon rank-sum Test (Wtest) [ ], also called Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test, is considered as an alternative to T-test for its increased robustness [ ]. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (KStest) is usually employed to estimate how much two distributions are related to each other and its promising performance for eliminating redundant features has been proved in [ ]. Besides, we further discussed the impact of different filter thresholds for the statistical Pvalues on classification performance. \n\n\n### CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE \n  \n#### EVALUATION METRICS \n  \nFor a fair comparison with the existing studies, we employed the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) to measure the classification performances of MCI and NC samples. To compare the classification performance of different correlation coefficients combined with different feature selection methods and different parameters, we set one LOOCV for each combination. Specifically, each LOOCV trained one model on (num −1) subjects and predicted the class label of the rest one sample. Performance of each combination can be gained after num  repeats of LOOCV. To further verify the performance of the best combination, we adopted the two-level LOOCV, which is also called nested-LOOCV. \n\nThis study evaluated a classification model using three popular classification performance metrics, i.e., Accuracy (Acc), Sensitivity (Sn) and Specificity (Sp). The MCI and NC participants were regarded as positive and negative samples, respectively. The total numbers of positive and correctly predicted positive samples were defined as P and TP (true positive). FN = P - TP was the number of those incorrectly predicted positive samples. The numbers of correctly and incorrectly predicted negative samples were TN (true negative) and FP (false positive), respectively. And there were N = TN + FP negative samples. The performance metrics Sn and Sp were defined as the percentages of correctly predicted positive and negative samples, respectively. That is to say, Sn = TP/(TP + FN) = TP/P and Sp = TN/(TN + FP) = TN/N. And Acc was the overall percentage of correctly predicted samples, i.e., Acc = (TP + TN)/(P + N). \n\nFor each test sample of an LOOCV, we can get a series of selected feature subsets. Further analysis on these feature subsets was expected to bring inspiration to the diagnosis of MCI. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n  \n### EVALUATION OF BFCNs USING DIFFERENT CORRELATION COEFFICIENT METRICS \n  \nThis study firstly evaluated how different correlation coefficient metrics impact the binary classification performances of the investigated problem, as shown in  . The support vector machine with the linear kernel (lSVM) was used as the classifier for the evaluation [ ]. The metrics MIC achieved the best classification accuracy (Acc) for the static BFCN-based models, as shown in  . The MIC-based static BFCN also achieved a less-biased pair of Sn and Sp. The two metrics SCC/KCC performed better in Sn than MIC, but their Sp values were much smaller than that of MIC. But for the dynamic BFCNs, MIC performed worse than all the other four correlation coefficient metrics, as shown in  . Further detailed comparison in Sn and Sp can be found in  . The experimental data suggested that there was no single correlation coefficient metrics performing the best for both static and dynamic BFCN-based MCI classifications. \n\n\n### EVALUATION OF MuscNet \n  \nWe then evaluated MuscNet models with different correlation coefficient (CC) duets. As shown in   and  , MuscNet significantly outperformed dynamic BFCN based on one correlation coefficient with a maximal accuracy 0.8978. Except for the KCC-based BFCNs, all the other CC-based BFCNs may be improved by integrating one more CC metrics. MIC performed the worst if it was used alone to construct the dynamic BFCN (Acc = 0.7956) but improved both PCC- and SCC-based models if the MIC was integrated with one of these two CC metrics. And MIC didn’t decrease the classification accuracies of the other two CC-based models if being integrated with KCC- and CS-based models. So MIC may be a good complementary CC metrics to be integrated with the other CC metrics. \n\n\n### EVALUATION OF FEATURE SELECTION ALGORITHMS \n  \nDifferent filter algorithms were evaluated for their improvements on the MuscNet models, as shown in  . The above-discussed results were carried out using Ttest as the feature selection algorithm. Ttest may not always perform the best on different datasets [ ], [ ]. So we further evaluated the three filter algorithms Wtest, Ttest and KStest. Features were selected for training the classification model if their filter-based Pvalues were smaller than 0.05. Firstly, Ttest didn’t always achieve the best classification performances, as shown in  – . Ttest and Wtest performed similarly well on the classification accuracies, and KStest achieved the best performances (Acc = 0.9124, Sn = 0.8971 and Sp = 0.9275) with two parameters window  = 90 and window  = 8 and the integration of MIC and KCC. \n\n supported the above observation that MIC served as a good source of complementary information to the other CC metrics, although MIC didn’t perform well by itself. The best model with Wtest was integrated from PCC- and MIC-based dynamic BFCNs using the two parameters window  = 110 and window  = 8. The best model with Ttest was integrated from PCC- and MIC-based dynamic BFCNs with window  = 50, window  = 1 as sliding window parameters. And the best model with KStest was integrated from MIC- and KCC-based dynamic BFCNs with window  = 90, window  = 8, as shown in  . \n\n\n### PROMOTION BY PARAMETERS TUNING \n  \nWe further investigated how the filter Pvalue threshold impacted the model prediction performances.   illustrated that KStest-selected features with the Pvalue threshold 0.2 achieved the best prediction accuracy 0.9197 by integrating MIC- and KCC-based dynamic BFCNs. Results of each sliding window parameter combination can be found in  . A similar pattern was also observed that MIC-based BFCN improved all the four other CC-based dynamic BFCNs. \n\n suggested that Ttest didn’t perform well on the dataset and the Ttest-based dynamic BFCN model only achieved Acc = 0.8978, as shown in  . Wtest achieved a better overall accuracy 0.9051 by integrating the MIC- and SCC-based dynamic BFCNs. And the KStest achieved an even better accuracy 0.9197 for two models MIC&SCC and MIC&KCC. Verification results of this best model using the two-level LOOCV also get the accuracy 0.9197, suggesting that the set of the best parameters is also effective on the cross validation strategy. \n\n\n### COMPARISON BETWEEN MuscNet AND THE EXISTING STUDIES \n  \nThe MuscNet models were compared with the existing studies on the predicting performances of MCI patients, as shown in  . To be specific, for HON method, window  = 110, window  = 1; for LoM, HiO and FuMO methods, window  = 50, window  = 8. \n\nIt is demonstrated in [ ] that the high-order brain functional connectivity network (HON) performed effectively on detecting the MCI patients. Due to the variations in the samples used in each study, validation work in [ ] demonstrated that the HON model achieved the accuracy 0.8207 on their dataset, as shown in  . They proposed low-order model (LoM), high-order model (HiO) and the integrated fusion of both models (FuMO) to further improve the HON model, as shown in  . The experimental data suggested that LoM achieved the best accuracy 0.9051 in their study. \n\nThe MuscNet model outperformed all these four models in the prediction performance metrics Acc and Sn, and achieved the same specificity (Sp = 0.9130) as the fusion model FuMO. \n\n\n### BRAIN ROIs ASSOCIATED WITH THE MCI PREDICTION \n  \nAs mentioned above, the best model in this study was the MIC&KCC model with window  = 110, window  = 10 and KStest Pvalue threshold 0.2. The top-10 most frequently selected ROIs of the best model were collected and analyzed for their known associations with MCI, as shown in  . A set of ROIs was selected during each iteration of the LOOCV, and the ROIs were ranked by their frequencies of being selected by these iterations. We can see from   that the two model had more than half features in common, which means that the two models have a certain similarity in the description of the correlation, and they can both capture the core characteristics of rs-fMRI data. As for the difference set, all top-10 features selected by MIC also had a high selected frequency in the KCC model, not vice-versa. \n\nSeven brain ROIs were frequently selected by both MIC and KCC models. Cerebellum was a biomarker ROI that contributed to the best MCI prediction accuracy, and it has already been observed to be involved in the development of both MCI and AD [ ], [ ]. Insula was a crucial structure for high-level cognition and was also observed in close associations with various neurodegenerative diseases [ ], [ ]. Other ROIs like lingual gyrus [ ] and postcentral cingulate cortex [ ] demonstrated to have reduced metabolism levels and were observed in the MCI or AD patients. \n\nThe previous study suggested the existence of multiple solutions with the similarly good performance for a machine learning problem [ ], [ ]. Difference correlation coefficients evaluated the MCI prediction problem from different perspectives. These correlation coefficients may generate different sets of features for the prediction models. And MuscNet achieved slightly better performance using different features than the other models, as shown in  . \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nThis study proposed the weighted voting-based fusion of a multi-source connectivity network (MuscNet) by integrating dynamic BFCNs using different correlation coefficients. This idea was inspired by the observation that the integration of low-order and high-order BFCN generated satisfying disease prediction performances. \n\nOur experimental data demonstrated that the CC metrics MIC served as a complementary information source. Although MIC-based dynamic BFCN didn’t perform well, the integration of the MIC-based dynamic BFCN with other models usually improved these models. The proposed MuscNet model also improved the existing studies in predicting MCI. The statistical KStest performed the best on selecting features and the best model was the MIC&KCC-based dynamic BFCN. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"110cd63d9d397cc9f943731a65a12ca2"},

However, it is unclear whether specific subtypes of trauma (i.e., experienced vs observed or community) showcase differential effects. This study examined whether subtypes of childhood trauma (assessed via the Trauma Checklist [TCL] 2.0) were associated with aberrant intra-network amplitude of fluctuations and connectivity (i.e., functional coherence within a network), and inter-network connectivity across resting-state networks among incarcerated juvenile males (  n   = 179). Subtypes of trauma were established via principal component analysis of the TCL 2.0 and resting-state networks were identified by applying group independent component analysis to resting-state fMRI scans. We tested the association of subtypes of childhood trauma (i.e., TCL Factor 1 measuring experienced trauma and TCL Factor 2 assessing community trauma), and TCL Total scores to the aforementioned functional connectivity measures. TCL Factor 2 scores were associated with increased high-frequency fluctuations and increased intra-network connectivity in cognitive control, auditory, and sensorimotor networks, occurring primarily in paralimbic regions. TCL Total scores exhibited similar neurobiological patterns to TCL Factor 2 scores (with the addition of aberrant intra-network connectivity in visual networks), and no significant associations were found for TCL Factor 1. Consistent with previous analyses of community samples, our results suggest that childhood trauma among incarcerated juvenile males is associated with aberrant intra-network amplitude of fluctuations and connectivity across multiple networks including predominately paralimbic regions. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for traumatic loss, observed trauma, and community trauma in assessing neurobiological aberrances associated with adverse experiences in childhood, as well as the value of trained-rater trauma assessments compared to self-report. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nNearly all incarcerated youth have experienced some form of trauma prior to their incarceration ( ,  ). Incarcerated juvenile males are nearly-three times more likely to have been victims of assaultive violence and are two to 15 times more likely to have witnessed violence than comparable juvenile community samples ( ,  ,  ). Accordingly, the rate of PTSD in incarcerated juvenile males is estimated to be up to eight times the rate present in non-incarcerated youth ( ,  ). Emerging research suggests that these types of childhood traumas and resulting psychopathologies have an undue effect on the neurobiology of the individual (see   for a review on the subject). While the descriptive prevalence of trauma exposure and the resulting psychopathologies in incarcerated juvenile populations is well-established in the literature (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ), the exact effects of childhood trauma on neural abnormalities are less clear. \n\nBroadly, research suggests that childhood trauma is related to abnormal intra- and inter-network activational profiles during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) scans. These functional aberrances have been reported to primarily occur in limbic and paralimbic regions within the salience network (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, insulae, temporal poles, ventral striatum, and amygdalae), though have also been observed in non-limbic/paralimbic networks as well (e.g., the default mode network including the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex;  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). On a more global, inter-network level, childhood maltreatment also relates to aberrant connectivity between the default mode, dorsal attention, and frontoparietal networks ( ). While many of the analyses constituting this field have assessed trauma more generally (i.e., total scores on trauma measures), studies have not investigated whether subtypes of trauma (e.g., physical abuse vs traumatic loss) relate to particular resting-state functional connectivity measures. Specifically, previous studies have failed to measure instances of observed trauma or control for this subtype of trauma in their analyses with other subtypes of trauma (e.g., experienced trauma). Likewise, the relationship of trauma to alternative resting-state activational measures, including amplitude of fluctuations (AFs), has been left unexplored in the literature. AFs may be particularly important to investigate, as they have been linked to psychiatric disorders, behavioral characteristics, and are thought to underlie functional connectivity more generally ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), By assessing aberrant global (inter-network) and local (intra-network and AFs) measures of trauma-related connectivity, a more thorough picture of the effects of trauma on the brain can be offered. \n\nAs different types of childhood trauma are associated with alternative psychopathologies and divergent tendencies towards antisocial outcomes (e.g., relapse and rearrest), it is imperative to understand the neurobiological correlates that may be promoting these patterns ( ,  ,  ). Likewise, being able to establish the relationship between specific childhood traumas and regional abnormal brain activity may have additional translational value in region-specific non-invasive brain stimulation interventions meant to ease the symptoms related to trauma-induced psychopathologies ( ,  ). Here we report the use of the Trauma Checklist (TCL) 2.0—an assessment scored using multiple data sources (including institutional files, self-report and clinical assessments, and clinical videotaped interviews)—and principal component analysis (PCA) to test the effects of summed childhood trauma (in the case of novel cumulative effects of trauma) and specific subtypes of childhood trauma exposure (including types of community and observed trauma) on resting-state functional connectivity in a sample of 179 incarcerated juvenile males. We hypothesized that childhood trauma would be associated with aberrant functional connectivity (FC) in paralimbic regions spanning multiple cognitive domains, and that subtypes of trauma would exhibit differential patterns within these domains. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants included juvenile male offenders recruited from a maximum-security juvenile correctional facility—the Youth Diagnostic and Development Center of Albuquerque, New Mexico—who previously participated as part of NIH-funded research studies (R01 MH071896 and R01 HD092331). While all offenders within the correctional facility were offered the opportunity to participate in the current study, the final sample consisted of participants who completed the trauma assessment, met inclusion criteria, and had acceptable resting-state functional MRI scans (final   n   = 179). Inclusion criteria consisted of fluency in English at or above a fourth-grade reading level; estimated IQ over 60 ( ,  ); no history of psychotic disorder; and minimal motion, as assessed by an average spatial cross-correlation >0.75 of each participant’s most superior five mask slices during the resting-state fMRI scan with the   EPI   template (resulting in the removal of two participants from the original sample) (see   for similar methods). \n\nParticipants were between the ages of 14 and 20 (average age = 17.61 years, SD = 1.14 years) at the time of their rsfMRI scan and approximately 11 % were left-handed. Based on National Institutes of Health racial and ethnic classification, 58.7 % of the sample self-identified as white, 4.0 % as black/African American, 11.7 % as American Indian or Alaskan Native, 26.6 % as mixed/other, and, ethnically, 76.5 % as Hispanic or Latino. Participants provided written informed consent in protocols approved by the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Institutional Review Board via Independent Review (E&I) Services for the Mind Research Network and were paid at a rate commensurate with institution compensation for work assignments at their facility. \n\n\n### Trauma scoring \n  \nHistory of trauma was assessed using the TCL 2.0 [henceforth, TCL],  a modified version of a previous trauma assessment developed by our research group (for more detailed information on this trauma assessment, see  ). While both scoring methods investigated the same seven categories of trauma—i.e., instances of physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect/poverty, and also instances of trauma occurring in the environment they were raised in, such as observing trauma happening to others, instances of community violence, and experiencing traumatic loss—expansions to our trauma assessment included more detailed definitions and examples under each trauma category as well as raters using additional collateral information to score the TCL (e.g., the Upsetting Events Scale [UES], the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and the My Worst Experience Scale:  ,  ). Consistent with Dargis and colleagues (2019), the scoring criteria is as follows: 0 (not present/no evidence of trauma), 1 (few/minor instances of trauma), or 2 (many/serious/prolonged instances of trauma), with TCL Total scores potentially ranging from 0 to 14. Consistent with our previous study, we utilized principal component analysis to explore subtypes of trauma across the seven trauma categories ( ). \n\n\n### Substance use severity \n  \nTo control for the potential influence of substance use severity on resting-state functional connectivity measures, participants’ total summed years of regular alcohol/substance use (as assessed via a modified version of the Addiction Severity Index [ASI]) was calculated across the following categories: alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, sedatives, cocaine, opioids, PCP, hallucinogens, solvents, and other ( ). Regular substance use was defined as three or more times per week for a minimum period of one month. Total years of substance use were then divided by the participant’s age (to control for opportunity to use), multiplied by 100, and a square root transformation was applied to correct for skewness. This operational definition of substance use severity has been incorporated in previous studies by our research group ( ). \n\n\n### Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders \n  \nSimilar to our previous report ( ), we utilized the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS;  ) to assess whether or not participants met criteria for various forms of psychopathology, including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Potential anxiety disorders included generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, acute stress disorder, panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia), separation anxiety, phobias (i.e., social phobia and/or specific phobias), agoraphobia, or an anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS). Potential mood disorders included major depressive disorder (with and without psychotic features), dysthymia, melancholic depression, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, depressive disorder NOS, schizoaffective disorder (depressed and manic types), mania, hypomania, cyclothymia, or bipolar disorder NOS. Based on this criteria, and out of the 173 participants that were administered the KSADS,   n   = 5 participants met criteria for any anxiety disorder,   n   = 29 participants met criteria for any mood disorder  and   n   = 9 participants met criteria for ADHD and PTSD, respectively (see  ).   \nClinical Descriptive Information. \n    \n\n\n### Imaging parameters \n  \nResting-state functional magnetic resonance images were collected on the grounds of the correctional facility where participants were scanned using the Mind Research Network’s mobile Siemens 1.5 T Avanto with advanced SQ gradients (max slew rate 200 T/m/s, 346 T/m/s vector summation, rise time 200 us) equipped with a 12-element head coil. The   EPI   gradient echo pulse sequence (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 39 ms, flip angle = 75, FOV = 24 × 24 cm, 64 × 64 matrix, 3.75 × 3.75 mm in-plane resolution, 4 mm slice thickness, 1 mm gap, 27 slices) effectively covered the entire brain (150 mm) in 2.0 s. Head motion was minimized using padding and restraint. The participants were asked to lay still, look at the fixation cross and keep eyes open during the five-minute rsfMRI scanning. Compliance with instructions was monitored by eye-tracking. \n\n\n###  EPI   preprocessing \n  \nData were preprocessed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM12) ( ) ( ) including image reorientation, realignment (motion estimation using INRIAlign:  ), and spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard space at a resolution of a 3 × 3 × 3 mm . A full-width half maximum Gaussian kernel of 6 mm was then used for spatial smoothing. Framewise displacement (FWD), a measure of motion, as calculated utilizing the INRIAlign derived realignment parameters (utilizing the translation and rotation parameters as the mean of the sums of the absolute translation and rotation frame displacement), was investigated. As reported in our  , Section 9.6, results reported in our main manuscript were nearly identical when including FWD as a covariate in analyses performed. \n\n\n### Independent component analysis \n  \nWe applied group Independent Component Analysis (gICA) on the preprocessed rsfMRI data using the GIFT toolbox ( ) ( ). The rsfMRI data was compressed using two stages of PCA ( ). For the first data reduction step, we retained 100 principal components (PCs), and 50 independent components (ICs) for group data reduction, consistent with previously published studies ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Individual specific spatial maps and their time-courses were obtained using gICA. Out of the 50 ICs that were estimated, 28 components were identified as components of resting-state networks (RSNs) by evaluating whether peak activation occurred in gray matter, whether the peak spectral amplitude of fluctuations (AFs) occurred in the low-frequency power portion of the spectra of components, and whether the networks showcased reliability ( ,  ,  ). The reliability and stability of these extracted networks were evaluated by ICASSO ( ,  ), a process that runs multiple component estimations with alternatively bootstrapped datasets. This analysis suggested high stability across the 28 components (  mean stability index   = 0.94), well above the threshold of 0.80 established in the literature ( ,  ). Within GIFT, the time-courses of the RSNs underwent despiking and bandpass by filtering with [0.01–0.15] Hz cutoffs. \n\n\n### Functional connectivity measures \n  \nIn order to assess various types of resting-state functional connectivity measures, we calculated the static functional network connectivity (sFNC) between the selected 28 RSNs as pairwise correlations between the RSNs time-courses for each individual (inter-network connectivity or functional network connectivity; FNC, resulting in 378 values), pairwise correlations between individual voxels within the RNSs to the overall RSN’s time-course (intra-network connectivity, reflecting local functional connectivity, and values dependent on the number of voxels within a component), and the AFs within each RSN (divided into 127 spectral bins). \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nWe performed regression analyses using two separate factor scores of childhood trauma (see the Trauma Principal Component Analysis section below for extended details), as well as a total trauma score based on Dargis and colleagues’ primary focus in their establishing of the original TCL (2019), to identify associations between individual FNC values, intra-network connectivity, and AFs with these trauma measures: TCL Factor 1, Factor 2, and TCL Total scores. The models were corrected for “nuisance” covariates (age, IQ, and substance use severity),  and were also covaried with the other TCL Factor within models (i.e., TCL Factor 2 was controlled for while testing regressions of TCL Factor 1, and vice-versa). The significance of the univariate trauma results for each factor was determined using a false discovery rate (FDR) ( ) threshold at   p   < 0.05. Finally, in a subset of the sample (  n   = 78), we assessed whether scores from a self-report measure of trauma (i.e., the Upsetting Events Survey [UES];  ,  ) were associated with similar neurobiological effects as the trainer-rated TCL. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Trauma measures \n  \nScoring of the TCL was conducted by two independent raters who categorized and rated trauma experiences for each participant and then met to come to consensus on the final TCL scores to ensure reliability and accuracy of scoring. Pre-consensus ICCs suggested interrater reliability was moderate to high across all categories including Total score (α = 0.82), and subscale scores: physical abuse (α = 0.86), emotional abuse (α = 0.73), sexual abuse (α = 0.81), neglect/poverty (α = 0.64), observed trauma (α = 0.70), community violence (α = 0.75), and traumatic loss (α = 0.75). See   for group-wide endorsement of TCL items. \n\n\n### Trauma principal component analysis \n  \nPCA with a varimax rotation of the TCL yielded a two-factor  solution, accounting for 47 % of the variance in the total scale.  The two-factor solution was chosen based on multiple criteria: an Eigenvalue threshold of >1 (replicating methods used in our previous solution:  ), declining variance accounted for by higher factor solutions, and avoidance of single item factors solutions. As outlined in  , the Physical, Emotional, Sexual Abuse, and Neglect/Poverty items loaded onto one factor (i.e., Factor 1) and the Community Trauma, Observed Trauma, and Traumatic Loss items loaded on to a second factor (i.e., Factor 2). Generally, these factors correspond to trauma enacted on the individual (Factor 1: Experienced Trauma) and trauma observed by the individual (Factor 2: Community Trauma) (see   for average TCL scores across factors, and sample demographics). Factors 1 and 2 demonstrated good ICCs of α = 0.85 and α = 0.78, respectively.   \nPrincipal component factor loadings. \n      \nParticipant Demographics and assessment scores. \n    \n\n\n### Group independent component analysis \n  \n shows the spatial maps of the 28 selected RSNs. The 28 RSNs listed in   were grouped into six domains: auditory (AU), cerebellar (CB), cognitive control (CC), default mode (DM), sensorimotor (SM), and visual (VI) based on based on their peak coordinate, functional properties, the automatic labeling tool in GIFT ( ), and confirmed by visual inspection (see   for the estimated inter-network functional connectivities between domains and RSNs). As expected, strong within domain inter-network connectivities are present.   \nSpatial maps of the 28 independent components identified as RSNs categorized by domain [auditory (AU), cerebellar (CB), cognitive control (CC), default mode (DM), sensorimotor (SM), and visual (VI)] and component number. \n    \nResting-state networks (RSNs) domain names, IC numbers, and MNI peak coordinates. \n      \nFunctional network connectivity matrix of the 28 RSNs. \n  \n\n\n### Time course power spectra \n  \n#### TCL factor 1 scores: Experienced trauma \n  \nThere were no significant associations between TCL Factor 1 scores and AFs that survived FDR correction while controlling for age, substance use severity, IQ, and TCL Factor 2 scores. \n\n\n#### TCL factor 2 scores: Community trauma \n  \nTCL Factor 2 scores were associated with increased AF at high-frequency spectra bands (0.15 Hz−0.25 Hz) in the superior temporal gyri (Component 6, AU), insulae (Component 7, CC), and temporal poles (Component 9, CC) (see  ,  ,  ), while controlling for age, substance use severity, IQ, and TCL Factor 1 scores.   \nUnivariate associations between TCL Factor 2 scores and power spectra of significant components.

The UES is a self-report scale that includes 17 questions assessing different instances of childhood trauma, taking into account repeated instances of trauma. A Total UES score is calculated by summing across all 17 types of traumatic events. \n\n#### Relationship between trained-rater and self-report trauma scales \n  \nAs expected, there was a one-tailed positive correlation between TCL Factor 1, TCL Factor 2, and TCL Total scores (  M   = 7.62,   SD   = 5.30) with Total UES scores of r (76) = 0.219, p = 0.027, r (76) = 0.352, p = 0.001, and r (76) = 0.347, p = 0.001, respectively (see  ).   \nCorrelation matrix. \n    \n\n\n#### Relationship between Trained-Rater and Self-Report trauma scales with neurobiological measures \n  \nTo assess whether the neurobiological effects associated with the TCL extend to self-report trauma measures, we extracted average high-frequency spectra bands (0.17–0.25 Hz) from each component that showed corrected effects associated with TCL scores (i.e., components 6, 7, and 9). As expected, TCL Factor 2 and TCL Total Scores are associated with high-frequency bands of all three components (all r (177) > 0.191, p < 0.05), whereas UES Total scores are not significantly associated (p’s > 0.50: see  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere, we report that a specific subtype of childhood trauma (assessed via the TCL by trained-raters) was associated with aberrant functional connectivity measures during a resting-state fMRI experimental paradigm in a sample of incarcerated juvenile males. Consistent with our hypotheses and previous research ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), measures of childhood trauma—primarily those measuring community trauma, observed trauma, and traumatic loss—were associated with aberrant functional connectivity across multiple domains, yet primarily occurred within limbic and paralimbic regions. \n\nInstances of trauma assessed via Factor 2 of the TCL (i.e., community violence, observed trauma, and traumatic loss) were associated with increased AFs in high-frequency bands within the paralimbic system, including the superior temporal gyrus (IC6), insulae (IC7), and temporal poles (IC9), with Total TCL scores also showcasing similar temporal pole effects (see   and  ). Notably, these paralimbic regions contribute to multiple cognitive processes, including social cognition, theory of mind, and interoceptive representation, and previous research has demonstrated disrupted network connectivity stemming from these regions to be associated with childhood maltreatment ( ,  ,  ). More generally, a shift towards high-frequency AFs in rsfMRI is commonly associated with the natural aging process ( ,  ,  ). Childhood trauma has been previously associated with higher brain-age gaps ( ,  ), representing a more rapid maturing of the brain for those that experienced trauma (e.g., cortical thinning). Furthermore, research suggests that increased high-frequency AFs in the temporal and frontal lobes may serve as biomarkers for late onset depression, a form of psychopathology commonly associated with childhood trauma, and subsequently, poor interoception and social cognition ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Thus, the observed increase in high-frequency paralimbic AFs may relate to previously noted trauma-induced brain-age gaps, as well as literature establishing biomarkers for the development of late-onset depression. \n\nWe also observed that individuals with a history of more severe Community Trauma exhibited increased intra-network connectivity within the precuneus (IC40). More generally, those who scored high across all items on the TCL exhibited both increased and decreased intra-network connectivity within the fusiform gyrus and precuneus, respectively (IC27: see  ). These regions are commonly implicated in self-referential thinking and stimuli processing during social interaction (i.e., face processing) ( ,  ). Altered connectivity stemming from the precuneus, more specifically, has previously been linked to childhood maltreatment, substance use relapse, and depressive episodes in individuals with recurrent depression ( ,  ,  ,  ). Likewise, consistent with our findings of aberrant intra-network fusiform gyrus connectivity, additional research on the effect of childhood maltreatment suggests altered BOLD activity while viewing novel faces in the fusiform gyrus, an effect interpreted to denote trauma-induced heightened sensitivity to potential threats ( ). Thus, our observed effects may relate to literature noting trauma-induced vulnerability to neural alterations relevant to altered social interaction, antisocial actions, and depression ( ). \n\nBecause incarcerated juveniles are at heightened risk of childhood trauma and resulting psychopathologies, and have already demonstrated subsequent antisocial actions, our investigation of the impact of childhood trauma on brain-wide connectivity measures serves as an important and relevant contribution to the literature. More specifically, by demonstrating not only the regions affected by childhood trauma, but also in what way they are affected (e.g., increased high-frequency activations), our research provides support to previous literature in establishing and validating potential correlates for trauma-induced psychopathology and pinpointing possible regions for intervention (e.g., non-invasive brain stimulation) meant to curb the negative down-stream effects of trauma ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nLikewise, our analyses showcase the importance of trained-rater childhood trauma assessments as compared to self-reported trauma measures in identifying these types of neurobiological effects (see  , for a direct comparison between the TCL and the UES, as they relate behaviorally and neurobiologically). While we found a modest association between the TCL and UES, it is possible that additional variance is accounted for by the TCL trained-rater assessment compared to the self-report UES for multiple reasons: 1) scoring of the TCL relies on multiple potential sources of information (institutional files, self-report, and clinical interviews) rather than solely self-report, 2) the self-report UES was only available for a subset of the present sample (  n   = 78), 3) the trauma categories included in the TCL (e.g., observed and community violence) may be more applicable to the sample tested (New Mexican youth) than questions included in the UES (e.g., weather disasters, etc.), and 4) while participants may experience traumatic experiences, they may not categorize such experiences as traumatic themselves (an issue that is avoided by the trained-rater TCL). The additional variance (and relationships with neurobiological measures) accounted for by the trained-rater TCL may suggest that more comprehensive trained-rater measures are more sensitive in identifying neural correlates of trauma that similar self-report measures. \n\n### Study limitations \n  \nThe results of this study are presented alongside a number of limitations. While we report effects of Community Trauma (Factor 2) on aberrant functional connectivity, effects of Experienced Trauma (Factor 1) are null. One explanation of this (lack of) result, is that comparatively, Factor 1 had a much lower base rate compared to Factor 2 (see  ), leaving analyses potentially underpowered for detecting effects related to this specific subtype of trauma. Likewise, because our present sample is comprised of 179 juvenile males, it is unknown whether our results would generalize to females nor to individuals with childhood trauma that is less proximate (i.e., older adults, incarcerated or not, with childhood trauma). \n\nAn additional limitation of the present study is the fMRI paradigm utilized: a five-minute resting-state scan. While some research suggests that five-minutes is adequate time to ensure high stability RSNs ( ,  ,  ,  ), others suggest longer scans are necessary ( ). Likewise, though results garnered through resting-state analyses are informative in establishing correlates and potential targets for intervention, future research should consider the use of task-based scans to explore the relationship more granularly between childhood trauma, neurobiological correlates, and functional deficits. Thus, more work is needed to probe the relationships between various inter- and intra-network connectivity measures as they relate to childhood trauma (specifically, that of enacted trauma such as physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and neglect) and perhaps longer resting-state and task-based measures in large samples of both juvenile and adult men and women. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nThis study contributes to the current literature by examining the relationships of subtypes of childhood traumas with whole brain inter- and intra- network connectivity and AFs across RSNs. We showed that childhood trauma (specifically, Community Trauma) is associated with increased high-frequency AFs, and both increased and decreased intra-network connectivity across four brain domains (AU, CC, VI, SM), associated with decision-making, self-referential thinking, and social interaction. Similar to previous research, our results suggest that childhood trauma is primarily associated with aberrant functional profiles in paralimbic regions (e.g., temporal poles and insulae), yet effects also extend to sensory domains (i.e., auditory, visual, and sensorimotor). Our results showcase childhood trauma related aberrant functional connectivities at a local (i.e., intra-network connectivity and AFs) rather than a global (i.e., inter-network connectivity) level, suggesting the benefit of alternative approaches to investigating the neurobiological correlates that may undergird trauma induced psychopathologies. To our knowledge, this represents the largest study to date on the relationships of childhood trauma and functional connectivity aberrances in incarcerated juveniles. \n\n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Corey H.

However, due to practical limitations, many studies do not collect enough resting-state data to generate reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity necessary for studying individual differences. Here we present general functional connectivity (GFC) as a method for leveraging shared features across resting-state and task fMRI and demonstrate in the Human Connectome Project and the Dunedin Study that GFC offers better test-retest reliability than intrinsic connectivity estimated from the same amount of resting-state data alone. Furthermore, at equivalent scan lengths, GFC displayed higher estimates of heritability than resting-state functional connectivity. We also found that predictions of cognitive ability from GFC generalized across datasets, performing as well or better than resting-state or task data alone. Collectively, our work suggests that GFC can improve the reliability of intrinsic connectivity estimates in existing datasets and, subsequently, the opportunity to identify meaningful correlates of individual differences in behavior. Given that task and resting-state data are often collected together, many researchers can immediately derive more reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity through the adoption of GFC rather than solely using resting-state data. Moreover, by better capturing heritable variation in intrinsic connectivity, GFC represents a novel endophenotype with broad applications in clinical neuroscience and biomarker discovery. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has proven invaluable for identifying the neural architecture of human behavior and cognition ( ;  ;  ). Accordingly, fMRI has been widely adopted in myriad studies seeking to deepen our understanding of the human brain in both health and disease ( ;  ;  ). Recently, fMRI studies have expanded in both scale and scope, often collecting data in thousands of individuals in an effort to adequately power the search for neural correlates of complex human traits and predictive biomarkers for mental illness ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In this context, most studies have focused on the acquisition of resting-state functional MRI to map the intrinsic connectivity of neural networks. This choice is often prompted by three considerations. First, intrinsic connectivity networks appear to be more heritable than task-elicited activity ( ;  ;  ). Second, resting-state data are relatively easy to collect from informative populations of children, the elderly, and mentally ill patients ( ;  ;  ). Third, intrinsic connectivity plays a primary role in shaping task-based brain activity and associated behaviors ( ,  ;  ;  ). \n\nWhile analyses of resting-state data have revealed insights about average, group-level features of the human brain ( ;  ;  ), progress has lagged in identifying individualized signatures, which are critical if ongoing large-scale studies are to be successful in the search for risk and disease biomarkers. This lack of progress partially reflects the generally poor test-retest reliability of intrinsic connectivity estimates in many resting-state datasets ( ;  ). The reliability of intrinsic connectivity measures must be improved, as unreliability limits the ability to predict individual differences that could become clinical biomarkers ( ;  ). In this paper we propose general functional connectivity (GFC), a simple method for combining resting-state and task fMRI data to improve the reliability of intrinsic connectivity. \n\nHistorically researchers have collected 5–10 min of resting-state data in response to both published recommendations ( ;  ) and practical limitations (e.g., scan time, cost and subject stamina). While such data may be adequate for detecting patterns of intrinsic connectivity common across individuals, more than 25 min of data are needed to reliably detect individual differences in these same patterns ( ;  ;  ). This suggests that intrinsic connectivity may simply be a noisy measure of stable individual differences and that lengthier measurement is needed to identify the “true” signal ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, due to the high cost of scan time and the limited ability of many individuals including children, the elderly, and the mentally ill to lie still without falling asleep for tens of minutes of scanning, this level of protracted measurement is simply not feasible for a majority of studies ( ;  ;  ). To illustrate the point, two recent meta-analyses of resting-state intrinsic connectivity in depression ( ) and schizophrenia ( ) revealed average resting-state scan times of 6.53 min (k = 23 studies) and 6.24 min (k = 36 studies), respectively. It is likely that intrinsic connectivity based on these brief scans has low reliability, reducing the ability to discover individual differences and related biomarkers. If measures of intrinsic connectivity are to realize their potential as a clinical tool ( ;  ) and contribute to personalized medicine ( ;  ), there must first be substantial improvement in their reliability, and this should be ideally achieved within the practical limitations of study design and participant burden. \n\nAlthough few studies collect enough resting-state data to achieve high levels of reliability, many collect multiple task scans in addition to a resting-state scan. While it has been implicitly assumed that task and resting-state scans are two separate measures of brain function, to be analyzed and studied independently, a growing body of evidence suggests that the intrinsic connectivity measured by each may have substantial overlap, sharing over 80% of the same variance ( ;  ;  ). In fact, it has long been known that intrinsic networks extracted from task scans are quite similar to those extracted from resting-state scans, and task scans have been used for intrinsic connectivity analyses when resting-state data are absent ( ;  ;  ;  ). Further, mental operations that occur during task states have been linked to resting-state functional networks ( ;  ), and task scans have been shown to accentuate individual differences in network dynamics ( ;  ;  ). Despite this evidence for a complementary relationship between resting-state and task fMRI, they are typically investigated separately. Even when researchers have collected both task and resting-state fMRI in the same subjects, analyses of intrinsic connectivity are almost always performed on a single short resting-state scan despite the low test-retest reliability of short scan data. If it could be demonstrated that the reliability of intrinsic connectivity can be improved by adding task to resting-state fMRI, many researchers could immediately benefit by adopting this approach in data they have already collected, and also in designing future studies. The field of individual-differences neuroscience would also benefit from the resulting increase in reliability, replicability, and power that would follow the widespread adoption of combining task and resting-state fMRI. \n\nHere we hypothesized that measures of intrinsic connectivity will be more reliable when task and resting-state scans are combined into a longer dataset (i.e., GFC) compared to short resting-state scans alone. Additionally, we hypothesized that this boost in reliability with GFC will increase the amount of heritable variation detectable in intrinsic connectivity, because the detection of heritability requires reliable measurement. Finally, we hypothesized that GFC would measure a common backbone of intrinsic connectivity common across task and resting-state data allowing for better out-of-sample prediction of individual differences. We examined two existing datasets in 3 different ways to test these hypotheses. First, we investigated the test-retest reliability of different combinations of task and resting-state data in both the Human Connectome Project (HCP ( )), which uses state-of-the-art fMRI hardware and acquisition parameters in a highly educated, healthy sample, and in the Dunedin Study ( ), which uses more common fMRI hardware and acquisition parameters in a population-representative birth cohort. Second, we estimated the heritability of GFC and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) by leveraging the twin sampling design of the HCP. Third, we investigated the ability of GFC to measure generalizable individual differences in cognitive ability across samples and across task states by testing out-of-sample prediction of cognitive ability in the HCP and Dunedin Study samples. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Datasets \n  \n Human Connectome Project  . This is a publicly available data set that includes 1206 participants with extensive MRI and behavioral measurement ( ). In addition, 45 of these subjects completed the entire scan protocol a second time (referred to hereafter as “test-retest sample”). All participants were free of current psychiatric or neurologic illness and were 25–35 years of age. In all analyses, subjects were excluded if they had truncated scans, less than 40 min of combined task data, or less than 40 min of resting-state data after censoring. Much of the HCP dataset consists of twins and family members. We exploited this feature of the design for conducting heritability analyses. For these analyses, 943 participants from 420 families met inclusion criteria (144 monozygotic families, 85 dizygotic families, and 191 full sibling families). To avoid bias due to family confounding in the prediction analyses, only one individual per family was retained (the family member with the least motion during scanning). This resulted in 298 subjects left to be used in our prediction analyses. Eight subjects were removed from our test-retest analyses because they had at least one fMRI scan with truncated or missing data. Four subjects were removed because they did not have sufficient data (i.e., >40 min of rest and >40 min of task) after censoring. Therefore, the test-retest reliability analyses included data from 33 participants. \n\nThe acquisition parameters and minimal preprocessing of these data have been described extensively elsewhere ( ). In our analyses, we used the minimally preprocessed data in volumetric Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (“fMRIVolume” pipeline). Briefly, participants underwent extensive MRI measurement that included T1 and T2 weighted structural imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and nearly 2 h of resting-state and task fMRI. One hour of resting-state fMRI was collected on each participant in four 15-min scans (1200 time-points each) split-up into two scanning sessions over two days. In each scan session the two resting-state scans were followed by task fMRI ( ). Across the two sessions, each participant completed seven fMRI tasks described extensively elsewhere ( ). Briefly, tasks were designed to identify functionally relevant “nodes” in the brain and included working memory (810 timepoints, 10:02 min), gambling (506 timepoints, 6:24 min), motor function (568 timepoints, 7:06 min), language (632 timepoints, 7:54 min), social cognition (548 timepoints, 6:54 min), relational processing (464 timepoints, 6:52 min) and emotional processing (352 timepoints, 4:32 min). Altogether, 4800 timepoints totaling 60 min of resting-state fMRI and 3880 timepoints totaling 48:30 min of task fMRI were collected on each participant. \n\n Dunedin Study.   This is a longitudinal investigation of health and behavior in a complete birth cohort of 1037 individuals (91% of eligible births; 52% male) born between April 1972 and March 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand (NZ), and eligible based on residence in the province and participation in the first assessment at age three. The cohort represents the full range of socioeconomic status on NZ's South Island and matches the NZ National Health and Nutrition Survey on key health indicators (e.g., BMI, smoking, GP visits) ( ). The cohort is primarily white; fewer than 7% self-identify as having non-Caucasian ancestry, matching the South Island ( ). Assessments were carried out at birth and ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years, when 95% of the 1007 study members still alive took part. Neuroimaging data collection is ongoing in participants who are now aged 45 years. We currently have collected completed neuroimaging data for 756 study members. Data were excluded if the study member did not complete the rest scan and all four task scans or if they did not have sufficient data after censoring and bandpass filtering was applied to the resting-state and each task scan separately (see below for censoring details). Data for 591 subjects survived these fMRI exclusion criteria and were included in analyses. Additionally, 20 study members completed the entire scan protocol a second time (mean days between scans = 79). Of these one failed to have sufficient degrees of freedom after censoring and bandpass filtering. Therefore, the test-retest reliability analyses included data from 19 participants. \n\nEach participant was scanned using a Siemens Skyra 3T scanner equipped with a 64-channel head/neck coil at the Pacific Radiology imaging center in Dunedin, New Zealand. High resolution structural images were obtained using a T1-weighted MP-RAGE sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2400 ms; TE = 1.98 ms; 208 sagittal slices; flip angle, 9°; FOV, 224 mm; matrix = 256 × 256; slice thickness = 0.9 mm with no gap (voxel size 0.9 × 0.875 × 0.875 mm); and total scan time = 6:52 min. Functional MRI was collected during resting-state and four tasks with a series of 72 interleaved axial T2-weighted functional slices acquired using a 3-fold multi-band accelerated echo planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 27 ms, flip angle = 90°, field-of-view = 200 mm, voxel size = 2 mm isotropic, slice thickness = 2 mm without gap. \n\n8:16 min (248 TRs) of resting-state fMRI was collected immediately before the four task fMRI scans. During the resting-state scan participants were instructed to stay awake with their eyes open while looking at a grey screen. Participants completed an emotion processing task (6:40 min, 200 TRs), a color Stroop task (6:58 min, 209 TRs), a monetary incentive delay (MID) task (7:44 min, 232 TRs) and an episodic memory task (5:44 min, 172 TRs). All four tasks are described in detail in the supplement. \n\n\n### fMRI pre-processing \n  \nMinimal preprocessing was first applied to all data. For the HCP dataset this was done with the HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline ( ) and included correction for B0 distortion, realignment to correct for motion, registration to the participant's structural scan, normalization to the 4D mean, brain masking, and non-linear warping to MNI space. \n\nMinimal preprocessing steps were applied to the Dunedin Study dataset using custom processing scripts. Anatomical images were skull-stripped, intensity-normalized, and nonlinearly warped to a study-specific average template in the standard MNI stereotactic space using the ANTs SyN registration algorithm ( ;  ). Time-series images were despiked, slice-time-corrected, realigned to the first volume in the time-series to correct for head motion using AFNI tools ( ), coregistered to the anatomical image using FSL's Boundary Based Registration ( ), spatially normalized into MNI space using the non-linear ANTs SyN warp from the anatomical image, and resampled to 2 mm isotropic voxels. Dunedin Study images were additionally corrected for B0 distortions. \n\nTime-series images for each dataset were further processed to limit the influence of motion and other artifacts. Voxel-wise signal intensities were scaled to yield a time-series mean of 100 for each voxel. Motion regressors were created using each participant's 6 motion correction parameters (3 rotation and 3 translation) and their first derivatives ( ;  ) yielding 12 motion regressors. Five components from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid were extracted using CompCorr ( ) and used as nuisance regressors, along with the mean global signal. In the Dunedin Study dataset, images were bandpass filtered to retain frequencies between 0.008 and 0.1 Hz. In the HCP dataset, images only underwent highpass filtering with a cutoff of .008 Hz. High frequency signals were retained because removing high frequency signals would have resulted in excessive loss of degrees of freedom due to the very low TR (0.75 s) ( ;  ). In the HCP dataset, we followed the empirically derived thresholds of .39 mm frame-wise displacement or 4.9 units above the median DVARS as recommended ( ). In the Dunedin Study dataset, we investigated a range of framewise-displacement cutoffs using QC-RSFC plots in order to derive the optimal threshold for removing motion artifact as recommended ( ). This investigation led to thresholds of 0.35 mm framewise-displacement and 1.55 standardized DVARS. In both datasets, nuisance regression, bandpass filtering, censoring, global-signal regression, and smoothing of 6 mm FWHM for each time-series were performed in a single processing step using AFNI's 3dTproject. Identical time-series processing was applied to resting-state and task time-series data with one exception. \n\nTo remove functional connectivity predominantly driven by task-evoked coactivation, signal due to task structure was added as an additional nuisance covariate to all task scans and removed from their time-series ( ) (see supplemental for details on task modeling and regression). However, we examined the impact of task structure on our estimates of intrinsic connectivity by conducting parallel analyses without the regression of task structure. While task regression had a small but consistent effect of lowering ICCs for intrinsic connectivity estimates (see  ), the ability to predict cognitive ability was slightly higher when task regression was applied (see  ). Thus, we focus on analyses with task regression in our primary results. \n\n\n### Effects of global signal regression \n  \nGlobal signal regression (GSR) was performed to adopt a conservative approach to motion artifact reduction and used in our main analyses ( ). However, because use of GSR is still debated ( ), we also preprocessed our data with parallel preprocessing methods without GSR (see  ). \n\n\n### Functional connectivity processing \n  \nWe investigated whole-brain intrinsic connectivity using two parcellation schemes. In the reliability and prediction analyses (described below), a 264-region parcellation was utilized. This parcellation was derived in a large independent dataset ( ). BOLD data were averaged within 5 mm spheres surrounding each of the 264 coordinates in the parcellation. In the heritability analyses we used a smaller 44-brain-region parcellation scheme due to computational constraints imposed by the time needed to fit heritability models at each edge independently (described below). This parcellation was derived from the 7-network parcellation scheme described in ( ). These 7 networks were broken up into 44 spatially contiguous regions across the two hemispheres. Average time series were extracted from all 44 regions. For both parcellations the average time-series was extracted independently from each scan session in every dataset. This allowed the time-series to be flexibly concatenated and recombined. Correlation matrices were derived from these time-series using Pearson correlation, resulting in 34,716 edges in the Power et al. parcellation and 946 edges in the Yeo et al. parcellation. \n\n\n### Test-retest reliability \n  \nIntraclass correlation (ICC) was used to quantify the test-retest reliability of intrinsic connectivity measures in the HCP and Dunedin Study test-retest datasets. ICC (3,1) was used in all analyses ( ). In the HCP dataset, the influence of the amount of data, as well as type of data (resting-state or task) on ICC was investigated. In the resting-state analyses, intrinsic connectivity matrices were calculated across a range of scan lengths (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min of post-censoring data) mirrored in the test and retest samples. ICCs were then calculated for each edge of this matrix, yielding 34716 (264 × 263/2) unique ICC values for each scan length. A more general definition of intrinsic connectivity was derived by including task data in the intrinsic connectivity matrices. GFC was formally investigated ( ,  ,  ) by constructing datasets from a combination of task and resting-state data over a variety of scan lengths (5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min of post-censoring data). In scan lengths up to 25 min, an exactly equal amount of data from all scan types (1/8 of total scan length from each task and resting-state) was combined. After this point, equal amounts of each task could no longer be added together because the shortest task scan no longer had sufficient timepoints remaining in all participants. Above 25 min, timepoints were selected at random from the pool of remaining timepoints. In the Dunedin Study, two ICC matrices were constructed. The first was built from each participant's single resting-state scan and the second from all task and resting-state scans to create the GFC matrix. Paired-sample t-tests were used to compare mean differences in reliability between ICC matrices constructed from traditional resting-state functional connectivity and GFC.   \nTest-retest reliability of intrinsic connectivity increases as the amount of data used to estimate either RSFC (A) or GFC (B) increases. Stacked bar plots from the HCP dataset displaying the proportion of functional connections (i.e., edges) across neural networks as defined by ( ) that meet criteria for excellent, good, moderate, and poor reliability as indexed by ICCs. \n  Fig. 1     \nTest-retest reliability of the intrinsic connectivity of canonical neural networks derived from either RSFC or GFC from the HCP scales with the amount of data available for analysis. Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) matrices for RSFC (left panel) and GFC (right panel) demonstrate comparable gains in reliability with increasing amounts of data across common intrinsic networks ( ). 5 and 10 min are written in red because these are common scan lengths for resting-state scans. 30 and 40 min are written in blue because many researchers have collected this amount of fMRI data when resting-state and task scans are combined. To the bottom left of ICC matrices is the color key for the ICCs, with a histogram indicating the density of ICCs for the corresponding graph. \n  Fig. 2     \nThe improvement in test-retest reliability of intrinsic connectivity as a function of adding data varies across canonical functional networks. In the left panel mean ICC for RSFC are displayed for within-network connections across 7 previously defined networks ( ) for a variety of scan lengths. In the right panel the same data are displayed for GFC. There are clear and consistent differences between networks. The limbic network consistently has the lowest mean ICC, while the default mode network consistently has the highest mean ICC. \n  Fig. 3   \n\nHCP fMRI data were collected in two phase-encoding directions (LR and RL). To minimize bias due to phase-encoding direction on our analyses, in each participant, for each task, timepoints were first selected from LR encoded scans until LR timepoints were exhausted. Subsequently, timepoints were selected from remaining RL-encoded scans. This ensured that all subjects had a roughly equivalent proportion of LR and RL timepoints within a given analysis. This also ensured roughly equivalent proportions of LR and RL phase encoding across test and retest correlation matrices when calculating ICCs. Selecting from LR first before RL had the additional benefit of mimicking shorter data-acquisition scans because timepoints were utilized in the order they were collected. \n\n\n### Heritability \n  \nFor each edge of the connectivity matrix, we ran an extended twin model ( ), which is an extension of the classic twin design in that it allows for the modeling of additional family members of twins. In the HCP study we had data from the families of monozygotic and dizygotic twins as well as siblings in families without a twin pair. In this model the variance of the phenotype (in this case correlations between brain regions) is partitioned into four sources: additive genetic factors (A), shared environmental factors (C), twin-specific factors (T), and unique environmental factors and error (E) based on the correlations between monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, and their siblings. Due to their small numbers, we eliminated half-siblings from the model (N = 27) and capped family size at four individuals (7 families affected, N = 13). This left us with 1078 individuals from 443 families (148 monozygotic families, 92 dizygotic Z families, 203 full-sibling families). Of these, 943 participants from 420 families (144 monozygotic families, 85 dizygotic families and 191 full-sibling families) had full scans from all tasks and rest and had at least 40 min of task data and 40 min of rest data after censoring. Heritability analyses were performed using OpenMx ( ;  ) in the R statistical computing environment. Each model also contained parameters to adjust for the effects of sex and age on the mean. Confidence intervals were obtained on the A, C, T, and E estimates using the mxCI command in OpenMx which obtains profile likelihood confidence intervals ( ). For each edge, an estimate was determined to be significant if the lower bound of the confidence interval was greater than zero. \n\n\n### Connectome-based predictive modeling \n  \nThe predictive utility of increasing reliability through our GFC measure was evaluated by testing the ability of the different intrinsic connectivity matrices to predict cognitive ability in the HCP and Dunedin Study datasets. Cognitive ability was measured in the HCP using the Raven's Progressive Matrices (PMAT24_A_CR) ( ). This measure was adopted because it is a proxy for cognitive ability that has been shown to be predicted by intrinsic connectivity in the HCP ( ;  ;  ). The WAIS-IV, a well-established and validated measure of individual differences in cognitive ability ( ), was used in the Dunedin Study. \n\nCognitive ability was predicted from intrinsic connectivity data using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM ( );). This framework provides a general method to predict any measure from intrinsic connectivity matrices. In this approach, predictors are filtered by selecting edges that have a p < .01 correlation with the measure of interest. Three linear regression predictive models are then built, one from the positive features (edges positively correlated with the phenotype of interest), one from the negative features (edges negatively correlated with the phenotype of interest), and one from the combination of positive and negative features ( ). Here we report results from the combined model (see   for results from all models). In our CPM analyses, we used both within-sample and out-of-sample prediction. Within-sample models were used to directly compare RSFC and GFC predictions of cognitive ability using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. Models were trained with all participants except one and used to predict the measure in the left-out participant. This was repeated until all participants had been left out. \n\nOut-of-sample prediction is the gold standard to test the unbiased predictive utility of models ( ;  ) and was therefore used to test the generalizability of predictive models built with RSFC, GFC, and task data. To test the influence of task state, data aggregation and scan length on predictive utility, models were trained with RSFC, GFC, and individual tasks in the Dunedin Study dataset and then used to predict cognitive ability from RSFC, GFC, and individual tasks in the HCP dataset. The Dunedin Study and HCP have three parallel tasks that tap into similar behavioral circuits. The gambling task in the HCP and the MID task in Dunedin Study both involve reward processing. The emotional processing task in the HCP and the face matching task in the Dunedin Study both involve passive processing of emotional facial expressions. Lastly, the working memory task in the HCP and the Stroop task in the Dunedin Study both tap into executive control. We restricted our analyses to comparisons of RSFC, GFC, and these 3 parallel tasks. The abilities of RSFC and GFC was contrasted with that of these parallel tasks to predict cognitive ability within tasks. In both within-sample and out-of-sample tests the Spearman correlation between predicted and true scores was adopted as an unbiased effect size measure of predictive utility. Model predictions of cognitive ability were assessed for significance using a parametric test for significance of correlations. All p-values from correlations with cognitive ability were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate ( ). Differences in predictive utility between models were compared using Steiger's z ( ). All confidence intervals for CPM prediction estimates were generated with bootstrap resampling, using AFNI's 1dCorrelate tool. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### What is the test-retest reliability of GFC? \n  \nWe used data from the HCP to evaluate the test-retest reliability of both intrinsic connectivity derived from resting-state scans alone and of GFC derived from combinations of task and resting-state scans. Test-retest reliability, as measured by ICC, ranges from 0 to 1, and is commonly classified according to the following cutoffs: 0–0.4 = poor, 0.4–0.6 = moderate, 0.6–0.75 = good and 0.75–1 = excellent ( ). In the HCP, when 5 min (post-censoring) of resting-state data were used to measure intrinsic connectivity defined within a common atlas of 264 regions ( ), the reliability was generally poor (mean ICC = 0.28, 95% CI [0.28, 0.28]; 71% of edges were poor, 23% moderate, 6% good, and less than 1% excellent). As more resting-state data were added, the test-retest reliability continued to increase up to the limits of the dataset at 40 min (mean ICC = 0.54, 95% CI [0.54, 0.54]; 26% of edges poor, 32% moderate, 25% good, and 18% excellent) ( A and left panel of  ). \n\nGFC, defined as exactly equal parts of task and resting-state data in the HCP, followed a similar pattern of increasing reliability with increasing data: 5 min of data exhibited poor reliability (mean ICC = 0.28, 95% CI [0.28, 0.28]; 70% of edges were poor, 22% moderate, 7% good, and less than 1% excellent) but 40 min of data showed good reliability (mean ICC = 0.56, 95% CI [0.55, 0.56]; 25% of edges were poor, 27% moderate, 24% good, and 23% excellent) (see  B, right panel of  ). In addition, resting-state scans were not required to generate a reliable measure of GFC, as this pattern of increasing reliability held when task data alone were used to measure intrinsic connectivity (see  ). Furthermore, data from individual task scans alone generally resulted in poor reliability (see  ). A paired sample   t  -test comparing ICCs across all edges revealed that GFC is significantly more reliable than resting-state functional connectivity when both are estimated with 40 min of data (t(34715) = 140.01, p < .001). While significant, this difference is not likely meaningful as it represents only a 0.02 larger mean ICC in GFC. The low p-value is driven by the large number of degrees of freedom in the   t  -test comparing a mean ICC estimate from nearly 35,000 edges. Thus, we see the mean ICC of RSFC and GFC as statistically separable but practically equivalent. \n\nThis general improvement in reliability with increasing data was not unique to the HCP but was also observed in the population-representative Dunedin Study. The Dunedin Study resting-state scan of 8:16 min showed generally low reliability (mean ICC = 0.30, 95% CI [0.30, 0.30]; 65% of edges were poor, 23% moderate, 10% good, and 2% excellent). The average reliability of the intrinsic connectivity estimates, however, improved by 49% when using GFC created in the Dunedin Study by combining the 8:16 min of resting-state data with 27 min (before censoring) of task data (mean ICC = 0.45, 95% CI [0.45, 0.45]; 41% of edges were poor, 26% moderate, 19% good and 14% excellent) ( ). \n\n\n### Influence of the global signal on reliability \n  \nGSR is still a controversial preprocessing step. Therefore, the main reliability analyses in the HCP were rerun without GSR to test the influence of GSR on ICCs. Mean ICCs for 5 min of data without GSR were poor for both RSFC (mean ICC = 0.31, 95% CI [0.31, 0.31]; 68% of edges were poor, 27% moderate, 4% good, and <1% excellent) and GFC (mean ICC = 0.35, 95% CI [0.35, 0.35]; 60% of edges were poor, 31% moderate, 8% good, and 1% excellent) (see  ). In parallel fashion to the data processed with GSR, ICCs increased as scan length increased up to 40 min for both RSFC (mean ICC = 0.61, 95% CI [0.61, 0.61]; 8% of edges were poor, 34% moderate, 41% good, and 16% excellent) and GFC (mean ICC = 0.63, 95% CI [0.63, 0.63]; 8% of edges were poor, 30% moderate, 40% good, and 22% excellent). Despite the improvement in mean ICC with additional data with and without GSR, ICCs were significantly higher when GSR was not applied: 40 min of GFC had an average ICC that was 0.07 higher without GSR than when GSR was applied. The same pattern was present in RSFC: 40 min of resting-state without GSR was more reliable on average than with GSR (rest with GSR = 0.61, rest without GSR = 0.54). While higher reliabilities without GSR could be a sign of improved detection of true individual differences in intrinsic connectivity, they may also be a sign of a stable propensity to move within the scanner, creating correlated motion artifact in test and retest data ( ;  ). Because the global signal is highly susceptible to motion artifact and there is no widely accepted method to isolate and remove just the artifactual component of the global signal while retaining the neural component, we adopted a conservative approach by applying GSR signal in all further analyses to ensure removal of motion related artifact present in the global signal ( ). \n\n\n###  Is there network specificity to improvements in reliability  ? \n  \nWe next investigated network specificity in reliability by looking specifically at the reliability of edges within each functional network rather than the reliability of the entire correlation matrix in aggregate. As shown in  , there was clear network heterogeneity in reliability. While all networks improved in reliability from 10 min of data to 40 min, some networks improved more. With both RSFC and GFC, the limbic network had the lowest reliability at all scan lengths, improving from 10 min of data (RSFC: mean ICC = 0.22, 95% CI [0.19, 0.25]; GFC: mean ICC = 0.30, 95% CI [0.25, 0.34]) to 40 min of data (RSFC: mean ICC = 0.37, 95% CI [0.33, 0.41]; GFC: mean ICC = 0.39, 95% CI [0.35, 0.44]), but failing to escape a poor mean ICC. In contrast, networks that over-represent heteromodal association cortex ( ;  ), namely the default mode network and fronto-parietal network, on average achieved moderate reliability with just 10 min of data for both RSFC (mean fronto-parietal network ICC = 0.53, 95% CI [0.52, 0.53]; mean default mode network ICC = 0.57, 95% CI [0.57, 0.58]) and GFC (mean fronto-parietal network ICC = 0.55, 95% CI [0.54, 0.56]; mean default mode network ICC = 0.57, 95% CI [0.57, 0.58]). Good reliability was achieved for these networks with 20 min of data for both RSFC (mean fronto-parietal network ICC = 0.62, 95% CI [0.61, 0.62]; mean default mode network ICC = 0.66, 95% CI [0.66, 0.67]) and GFC (mean fronto-parietal network ICC = 0.64, 95% CI [0.63, 0.64]; mean default mode network ICC = 0.65, 95% CI [0.65, 0.66]). With 40 min of data, these networks had mean reliabilities near the excellent range for both RSFC (mean fronto-parietal network ICC = 0.73, 95% CI [0.72, 0.73]; mean default mode network ICC = 0.75, 95% CI [0.75, 0.75]) and GFC (mean fronto-parietal network ICC = 0.74, 95% CI [0.74, 0.75]; mean default mode network ICC = 0.77, 95% CI [0.77, 0.77]). While there were some small differences in the network-specific reliabilities between RSFC and GFC (e.g., see dorsal attention network in  ), network specific improvements with increasing scan length were similar for RSFC and GFC. \n\n\n### What is the estimated heritability of RSFC and GFC at different scan lengths? \n  \nAs shown in  A, the estimated heritability of intrinsic connectivity depended on scan length. The amount of variance in RSFC attributable to the additive genetics (A) component of the ACE model increased consistently as the amount of data increased from 5 min (mean A component = .09, 95% CI [0.09, 0.1]) to 40 min (mean A component = .22, 95% CI [0.21, 0.23]). This represents an increase in the amount of variance in RSFC attributable to additive genetics of 138% as a function of increased scan length. This increase in variance explained by additive genetics was also present with GFC from 5 min (mean A component = .14, 95% CI [0.13, 0.14]) to 40 min (mean A component = .28, 95% CI [0.27, 0.29]). This represented an increase in the amount of variance in GFC attributable to additive genetics of 107% as a function of increased scan length. In addition, at equivalent scan lengths, GFC had significantly higher estimated heritability across edges than RSFC (e.g., 5 min: t(945) = 10.11, p < .001) and 40 min: (t(945) = 14.75, p < .001)). Correspondingly, higher estimated mean heritability in GFC than RSFC led to a greater percentage of heritable edges in GFC (see  B). In the ACE modeling, this pattern of increasing estimates of heritability with increasing scan time was associated with simultaneously decreased amount of variance explained by the E component, which comprises both non-shared environment and measurement error ( C). The E component decreased for both RSFC and GFC as data length increased from 5 min (RSFC mean E component = .81, 95% CI [0.81, 0.82]; GFC mean E component = .77, 95% CI [0.76, 0.77]) to 40 min (RSFC mean E component = .63, 95% CI [0.63, 0.64]; GFC mean E component = .61, 95% CI [0.60, 0.61]).   \nThe estimated heritability of RSFC and GFC varies as a function of scan length. Panels A, C and D display the mean A (additive genetics), E (non-shared environment + error) and C (shared environment) component estimates and 95% confidence intervals around those estimates, derived from ACE modeling of the twin data in the HCP. Scan length increases the A component and decreases the E component while having little effect on the C component. GFC also consistently has more variance attributable to the A component and lower variance attributable to the E component relative to RSFC. In panel B the % of heritable edges for RSFC and GFC are displayed across a variety of scan lengths. A heritable edge is defined as an edge with a lower bound of the 95% confidence interval that is larger than 0 in the ACE model. \n  Fig. 4   \n\nWhile the A and E components of the ACE modeling changed substantially with scan length, the shared-environment (C) ( D) and twin-specific (T) ( ) components were relatively stable with scan length. The variance attributable to the C and T components was similar for 5 min of RSFC (mean C component = .04, 95% CI [0.03, 0.04]; mean T component = .06, 95% CI [0.05, 0.06]) and 5 min of GFC (mean C component = .04, 95% CI [0.03, 0.04]; mean T component = .06, 95% CI [0.06, 0.07]) as well as with 40 min of RSFC (mean C component = .06, 95% CI [0.05, 0.06]; mean T component = .09, 95% CI [0.08, 0.09]) and 40 min of GFC (mean C component = .05, 95% CI [0.05, 0.06]; mean T component = .06, 95% CI [0.06, 0.07]). \n\n\n### Exploring the connection between intrinsic connectivity and cognitive ability \n  \nCPM was used to predict cognitive ability from both RSFC and GFC in both the HCP and the Dunedin Study. In the first set of analyses, within-sample predictions were made using leave-one-out cross validation in the HCP and Dunedin Study datasets separately ( , left and center panels). In the HCP dataset, we found that individual differences in cognitive ability could be predicted from 40 min of RSFC (r  = 4.2%, 95% CI [1.0%, 9.7%]) and from 40 min of GFC (r  = 7.6%, 95% CI [2.7%, 14.2%]) (see   and  ). These results were replicated and extended in the Dunedin Study using scan lengths that are more representative of existing datasets than the HCP. Cognitive ability could be predicted from the 8-min RSFC data (r  = 6.8%, 95% CI [3.5%, 11.3%]) as well as from 33 min of GFC (r  = 10.2%, 95% CI [5.9%, 15.0%]; all available data;  ). Although in comparison with RSFC, GFC had 81% greater predictive utility in the HCP dataset and 50% greater predictive utility in the Dunedin Study dataset, the statistical comparison of the correlations was not statistically significant in either the HCP (GFC r  = 7.6%, RSFC r  = 4.2%, Steiger's z = 1.317, p = .188) or the Dunedin Study (GFC r  = 10.2%, RSFC r  = 6.8%, Steiger's z = 1.72, p = .085). In addition, scan length had little effect on within-sample predictive utility (see  ).   \nGFC is better than RSFC at predicting cognitive ability both within and between samples. Results from CPM models predicting cognitive ability from RSFC and GFC. The x-axis displays predictions from leave-one-out cross validation within sample and out-of-sample models trained using the Dunedin Study dataset and tested using the HCP dataset. Predictive utility is displayed as % variance explained (r ). \n  Fig. 5   \n\nWhile leave-one-out cross validation has been widely used with CPM ( ;  ), the gold standard test of a model's generalizable predictive utility is its ability to predict a phenotype in an independent sample ( ;  ;  ). This is particularly important for GFC, as it purports to measure a generalizable feature of intrinsic connectivity and thus correlations between individual differences in GFC and phenotypes of interest should be shared across independent samples with different batteries of fMRI tasks. Therefore, we used CPM to train two models (one with rest and one with GFC) to predict cognitive ability in the larger Dunedin Study dataset and tested generalizability by measuring the ability of these models to predict cognitive ability in the HCP dataset. The models built with RSFC (r  = 5.6%, 95% CI [1.8%, 11.9%], p,q < .001) and GFC (r  = 9.5%, 95% CI [4.0%, 16.3%], p,q < .001) from the Dunedin Study dataset both successfully predicted cognitive ability in the HCP dataset (  right panel and   left panel). However, GFC had greater out-of-sample predictive utility than RSFC (GFC r  = 9.5%, RSFC r  = 5.6%, Steiger's z = 2.57, p = .010). This provides evidence that GFC is a more generalizable measure across independent samples than RSFC.   \nOut-of-sample prediction of cognitive ability for GFC is better than RSFC and as good as task-derived intrinsic connectivity. All models were trained on intrinsic connectivity data from the Dunedin Study and tested using data from the HCP. Models were trained and tested with the same type of data. With task data this meant that models were trained and tested with tasks that have a comparable (parallel) task in both the HCP and Dunedin study. Predictive utility is displayed as % variance explained (r ). \n  Fig. 6   \n\n\n### Does GFC predict cognitive ability better than intrinsic connectivity measured from specific tasks? \n  \nRecent research has suggested that intrinsic connectivity estimates derived from task data are better at predicting cognitive ability than estimates derived from resting-state data ( ). Our above finding that GFC outperforms RSFC at predicting cognitive ability is in line with this observation. However, given that many researchers collect different tasks and resting-state scans with different “task” demands (e.g., eyes-closed, fixation, etc.), we next investigated if GFC could perform as well or better than specific tasks at out-of-sample prediction of cognitive ability. We constructed five prediction models that were trained to predict cognitive ability using the Dunedin Study dataset (the population-representative sample with the gold-standard WAIS IQ test) and tested for generalizability using the HCP dataset (see   for the converse, models trained in HCP and tested in the Dunedin Study). Two models were carried over from the previous analyses (RSFC and GFC) and three additional task-specific models were added. These consisted of models trained and tested on three parallel tasks available in both the Dunedin Study and HCP (see methods for details). All models trained using the Dunedin Study dataset were able to significantly predict cognitive ability in the HCP dataset (all FDR q < .05;   and  ). Prediction of cognitive ability from RSFC data (r  = 5.6%, 95% CI [1.8%, 11.9%], p,q < .001), GFC data (r  = 9.5%, 95% CI [4.0%, 16.3%], p,q < .001), emotional processing data (r  = 9.8%, 95% CI [4.3%, 17.1%], p < .001, q = 0.001), reward processing data (r  = 9.1%, 95% CI [3.6%, 16.5%], p < .001, q = 0.001) and executive function data (r  = 4.6%, 95% CI [1.0%, 10.8%], p < .001, q = 0.001) all successfully generalized from the Dunedin Study dataset to the HCP dataset. \n\nComparing the relative performance of models trained with each type of data revealed that GFC was generalizable and performed as well or better at out-of-sample prediction of cognitive ability compared to all tasks ( ). Predictions of cognitive ability from GFC performed better than RSFC (GFC r  = 9.5%, RSFC r  = 5.6%, Steiger's z = 2.57, p = .01) and executive function data (GFC r  = 9.5%, executive function r  = 4.6%, Steiger's z = 2.19, p = .03), and performed as well as emotional processing data (GFC r  = 9.5%, emotion processing r  = 9.8%, Steiger's z = −0.10, p = .92) and reward data (GFC r  = 9.5%, reward r  = 10.2%, Steiger's z = −0.31, p = .76). Out-of-sample prediction was largely unaffected by the amount of data used in constructing the intrinsic connectivity matrices but was adversely affected when task regression was removed (see  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere we present GFC as a method for readily improving the reliability of intrinsic connectivity by combining resting-state and task data. Across two independent datasets we found that scan length had a significant impact on the reliability of intrinsic connectivity estimates regardless of whether the data came solely from resting-state scans (i.e., RSFC) or from a combination of resting-state and task scans (i.e., GFC). GFC, the addition of task scans to short resting-state scans, substantially increased the reliability of intrinsic connectivity over and above short resting-state scans alone. Moreover, we found that the improved reliability from aggregating data resulted in higher estimates of the heritable variation in intrinsic connectivity, and that this gain was larger for GFC than RSFC. In addition, GFC consistently performed better than RSFC and performed as well or better than intrinsic connectivity from individual task scans at predicting individual differences in a complex human trait, namely cognitive ability. \n\nThese findings have several implications for current and future neuroimaging research because they demonstrate that 1) reliable and heritable measurement of individual differences in the functional architecture of the brain is not only achievable in niche, specialty datasets with hours of resting-state scans, but also in many existing datasets if GFC is adopted; 2) mapping individual differences in behavior and cognition may be improved by adopting GFC, as demonstrated by generalizable predictive utility when studying cognitive ability; and 3) to the extent that commensurate gains in reliability and heritability may be achieved in other datasets, our results provide a reference that researchers can use to roughly estimate the gain in reliability they may achieve by adopting GFC ( ,  ,  ). We next elaborate on each of these points. \n\n### Data aggregation across task and resting-state scans boosts reliability \n  \nWe found that GFC, derived from the combination of resting-state and task scans, can be a reliable measure of individual differences in intrinsic connectivity. Consistent with previous studies ( ;  ;  ), we showed that the test-retest reliability of intrinsic connectivity is highly dependent on the amount of data collected. This is true of RSFC as well as GFC. With only 5–10 min of data, both RSFC and GFC show poor reliability in the HCP and Dunedin Study datasets. Only with 30–40 min of data do RSFC and GFC begin to broadly display good reliability. These findings follow directly from past studies that have shown reliability depends on scan length ( ;  ;  ), that task and resting-state data share a large proportion of variance ( ;  ), and that both task and resting-state data measure common individual differences in intrinsic connectivity ( ). Some functional networks, however, can achieve good reliability with relatively little data. For example, the default mode and fronto-parietal networks achieved good reliability for within-network connections with just 20 min of RSFC or GFC (see  ). In contrast, the limbic network failed to achieve even fair levels of reliability with up to 40 min of data. These findings suggest that the amount of data needed to derive reliable estimates of intrinsic connectivity for individual differences research will vary depending on the network of interest. \n\nImportantly, the current reality is that most neuroimaging studies have only 5–10 min of resting-state data, which are further limited by sampling variability, motion-artifacts, and other sources of noise ( ;  ;  ). Given the reliability estimates reported here, it is likely that in many studies, individual differences in intrinsic connectivity will be unmeasurable with resting-state data alone ( ;  ). Fortunately, it is common practice for researchers to collect 10–40 min of task fMRI in addition to resting-state. Therefore, if researchers adopt a broader definition of intrinsic connectivity, such as GFC, they can combine task and resting-state data to achieve a reliable measure of individual differences in intrinsic connectivity. \n\n\n### Data aggregation across task and resting-state scans boosts estimates of heritability \n  \nWe found that individual differences in intrinsic connectivity in both RSFC and GFC were significantly attributable to additive genetic influences. With 40 min of data, 22% of the variance in RSFC and 28% of the variance in GFC was attributable to additive genetic effects. With equivalent amounts of data, GFC produced higher heritability estimates than RSFC, and the influence of additive genetic effects was detectable in a larger proportion of functional connections ( ). In addition, we found that scan length had an impact on the heritability estimates of intrinsic connectivity in both RSFC and GFC. The average amount of variance in intrinsic connectivity that was attributable to additive genetic effects more than doubled in both RSFC (increase of 138%) and GFC (increase of 107%) as scan length increased from 5 to 40 min. While the heritability of intrinsic connectivity has been investigated before ( ;  ), the link between scan length and heritability has not been described. Although a reliable measure does not have to be heritable, a measure cannot have high heritability without high reliability ( ). That is, measurement reliability places a ceiling on the heritability estimate of a phenotype. Therefore, our finding that the heritability of intrinsic connectivity increases with increasing reliability suggests that the low reliability of intrinsic connectivity in short fMRI scans limits estimations of the true underlying heritability of intrinsic connectivity in many datasets. More specifically, our finding suggests that researchers should consider the amount of fMRI data available for estimation of intrinsic connectivity when planning and evaluating imaging genetics research. \n\nOur results have additional implications for genetically-informed fMRI research. Neuroimaging measures have been considered promising intermediate phenotypes that would bring researchers closer to the mechanisms through which genetics lead to heritable psychological traits ( ;  ;  ;  ). To uncover these links, large datasets like ENIGMA and the UK Biobank ( ;  ), have been used to conduct genome wide association studies (GWAS) of MRI-based phenotypes. While these investigations have had success in finding genetic variants linked to structural MRI measures ( ;  ,  ;  ), they have largely failed to find significant genetic correlates of functional intrinsic connectivity measures ( ). One reason for this failure may be the low reliability and heritability of the short resting-state scans typically used to derive individual differences measures of RSFC in these studies. Our results suggest that future GWAS may be better powered to find genetic variants linked to the functional architecture of the brain by adopting GFC rather than RSFC from short resting-state scans. \n\n\n### How general is general functional connectivity? \n  \nPrevious research has shown that the predictive utility of intrinsic connectivity can be higher when derived from task data than when derived from resting-state data ( ). Some task states in particular may reveal individual differences in intrinsic connectivity that aid in predictive utility ( ). While these findings provide insight into individual differences in intrinsic connectivity and a new use for task data, they pose a problem for replication and cumulative aggregation of findings across datasets. While most fMRI studies collect task data, very few collect the same tasks. Our findings here suggest that GFC may provide a solution to this problem. First, we found that like task-derived intrinsic connectivity, GFC can outperform RSFC when predicting within-sample and out-of-sample variability in cognitive ability ( ,  ). Second, we found that GFC performed as well or better than specific tasks alone at predicting cognitive ability out-of-sample. Critically, in these comparisons GFC was constructed with a combination of different tasks in the training and testing datasets suggesting that GFC may measure a common, generalizable backbone of intrinsic connectivity that can be applied and aggregated across independent datasets with different task batteries ( ). While further research is needed to replicate these findings, they nevertheless suggest that GFC may provide a generalizable, practical framework that researchers with resting-state and task data can use to drive a cumulative, predictive neuroscience of individual differences ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Is general functional connectivity too heterogeneous? \n  \nAn understandable reluctance in implementing GFC could be that it would introduce heterogeneity in the estimation of intrinsic connectivity. Whereas RSFC is thought to be a common framework with generalizability across datasets, the combination of different sets of tasks in different datasets may introduce additional variability. Below, we provide three reasons why we think this is less problematic than it first appears. We further provide specific recommendations and guidelines for adopting and estimating GFC and point to features of our analyses that support the validity of GFC as a robust and reliable measure of individual differences in intrinsic connectivity. \n\nFirst, resting-state data are by nature heterogenous, and the resting-state is its own type of task ( ). Researchers collect resting-state data under different conditions in which participants close their eyes, have their eyes open, or fixate. These differences in resting-state conditions influence intrinsic connectivity ( ). Despite these differences, all approaches are collectively referred to as resting-state scans. In addition, factors like thought content ( ;  ), caffeine intake ( ), recent cognitive tasks ( ), and falling asleep ( ) can introduce further heterogeneity that can bias intrinsic connectivity estimates. It has even been estimated that approximately 30% of participants fall asleep within the first 3 min of a resting-state scan ( ). Nevertheless, resting-state scans measure a common set of functional networks ( ), and display trait-like features driven by stable factors such as genetics ( ) and structural connectivity ( ). For these reasons resting-state data represent substantial promise as an individual-differences measure if enough data are collected to average out sampling variability ( ). But, as already stated, few researchers collect enough data to fulfill this promise. Connectivity estimates from task data are also shaped by many of these stable factors ( ;  ), and data from different tasks predominantly measure overlapping individual differences that are only weakly influenced by task demands ( ). Admittedly, GFC will vary, to some extent, across samples because each study collects a unique combination of resting-state and task data. However, RSFC will vary too. Moreover, we found that disparate task and resting-state scans collectively measure reliable, heritable individual differences with generalizable out-of-sample predictive utility in the form of GFC. \n\nSecond, the benefits of GFC converged across two different samples, with different scanners, scanning parameters, and demographics. The HCP represents a healthy sample of highly-educated individuals ( ), while the Dunedin Study represents a population-representative birth cohort with a broad range of mental and physical health conditions, socioeconomic status, and full representation of variability in many complex traits ( ). Across samples, the data came from 11 different tasks (HCP = 7, Dunedin Study = 4), many with unrelated cognitive demands, different scan lengths, stimuli, behavioral requirements, and instructions. The data were processed with different preprocessing schemes and software (“minimally preprocessed” in the HCP and custom scripts in the Dunedin Study). While the amount of scan time was tightly controlled in the HCP analyses (i.e., equal time after censoring), in the Dunedin Study motion censoring led to unequal scan lengths across participants as is the case in many analyses of intrinsic connectivity. Despite these many differences between datasets, the results demonstrate that GFC can achieve good test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability (different preprocessing schemes), out-of-sample reliability (convergence across datasets and out-of-sample prediction), and parallel forms reliability (different tasks in each sample) ( ). While we present evidence in favor of the generalizability of GFC, future research should further investigate the heterogeneity in GFC to find combinations of tasks that most efficiently estimate individual differences in intrinsic connectivity ( ;  ). \n\nThird, reliability fundamentally limits the ability to detect associations between any two measures ( ;  ). Therefore, any investigation mapping intrinsic connectivity to individual differences in behavior, cognition, or disease is fundamentally limited by the reliability of the intrinsic connectivity measures. Relatedly, statistical power to detect true effects depends on the anticipated effect size, which is in turn dependent on reliability of each measurement ( ;  ). Given that many studies only have 5–10 min of resting-state data and consequently poor reliability of intrinsic connectivity measures, they have drastically reduced statistical power ( ;  ,  ), and likely tenuous correlates of individual differences unless they adopt a framework like GFC. Previous research has found that collectively a large number of unreliable edges can achieve multivariate reliability that results in predictive utility ( ). While multivariate predictive utility may be achievable in studies with poor univariate edge-wise reliability ( ), the interpretability and clinical utility of these studies will be diminished by low univariate reliability. This is because interpretability and clinical utility depend on isolating specific brain areas or functional connections that can be said to be “most” important to the phenotype of interest. This cannot be done without decent univariate reliability because accurate estimation of true parameters in a prediction model depends on reliability ( ;  ;  ). For example, if researchers want to characterize biomarkers of mental illness that could be targeted with interventions like transcranial magnetic stimulation ( ) or real-time neurofeedback ( ), they will need to isolate specific circuits that with confidence can be said to be “altered” and relevant to the disease process in mental illness. Actionable identification of these biomarkers will only be possible with adequate univariate reliabilities. GFC provides a practical solution to this problem, while also addressing power and reliability issues that have been identified more generally in neuroscience ( ;  ) and beyond ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). GFC provides a tool for researchers to repurpose existing and future datasets to better contribute to a cumulative science of individual differences ( ) with clinical relevance ( ). For these reasons, we think that in many studies the gains in reliability offered by GFC will outweigh potential task-induced “heterogeneity.” \n\n\n### Recommendations \n  \nBased on the above summary, we generally recommend that researchers seeking to maximize the reliability and generalizable predictive utility of GFC should aggregate as much data as possible, across all rest, task and naturalistic fMRI data, that they have at their disposal ( ). Our results further suggest that with a minimum of 20 min of GFC data, researchers can achieve good reliability in some networks of broad interest (e.g., default, frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks). Furthermore, a strict balance of the amount of data from each task and resting-state scan is not necessary to achieve the benefits of GFC. This is demonstrated by the increased reliability of GFC despite unequal task lengths in the Dunedin Study dataset. It is also demonstrated in the HCP dataset by continued improvement in reliability despite timepoints being selected at random from the remaining data after reaching a minimum of 25 min of data. However, we urge caution in applying GFC to datasets that are heavily skewed (>50%) towards resting-state or one specific task. Although we expect that deriving GFC from this type of dataset will boost reliability, the generalizability of these findings to GFC derived from other datasets may be limited because of the overrepresentation of a specific type of data. Lastly, our results suggest that researchers developing new protocols may benefit from collecting multiple short task scans rather than a single longer task scan ( ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nHere we propose GFC as a method for improving the reliability of estimating individual differences in the intrinsic architecture of functional networks. We demonstrate that, when the amount of data available for analysis is held constant, the combination of resting-state and task data is at least as reliable as resting-state alone. Additionally, when the same amount of data is available, GFC produces higher heritability estimates than RSFC. Many researchers who have less than 25 min of resting-state data but have additionally collected task data on the same participants can immediately boost reliability, heritability, and power by adopting GFC as a measure of intrinsic connectivity when studying individual differences. Our findings also suggest that future data collection should consider naturalistic fMRI ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ) and engaging tasks in addition to resting-state scans when generating data for estimating intrinsic connectivity. This may be especially true when studying children, elderly, or mentally ill participants, as these groups often cannot lie still for 25 min or more of resting-state scanning ( ;  ;  ). Our current findings also suggest that researchers need not think of collecting resting-state and task data as a zero-sum competition for scan time when designing studies. Instead, our findings demonstrate that task and resting-state data provide complementary measures that together can lead to more reliable, heritable measurement of individual differences in intrinsic connectivity. We think that collecting adequate amounts (i.e., >25 min) of high-quality fMRI data should be emphasized over the traditional task-rest dichotomy, when individual differences are of interest. If fMRI is going to be a part of a cumulative neuroscience of individual differences with clinical relevance, psychometric measurement quality, especially reliability, must be at the forefront of study design. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nConceptualization, M.L.E.; Methodology, Software and Formal Analysis, M.L.E., A.R.K and M.C.; Data Curation, M.L.E., A.R.K., A.C., and T.E.M.; Resources, T.R.M., R.K., S.R., R.P., A.C., T.E.M. and A.R.H., Writing, M.L.E., A.R.K., M.J.K., M.C., T.R.M., R.K., D.I., S.R., R.P., A.C., T.E.M. and A.R.H.; Supervision, A.C., T.E.M. and A.R.H.; Funding Acquisition, R.P., A.C., T.E.M. and A.R.H. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"5b4419f6d7e76b43589ab15c364104fb"},

Accumulating data highlight that the frontopolar cortex can be considered a promising therapeutic target for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in SUDs. However, one-size-fits-all approaches to TMS targets resulted in substantial variation in both physiological and behavioral outcomes. Individualized TMS approaches to target cortico-subcortical circuits like amygdala-frontopolar have not yet been investigated in SUDs. \n\n\n## Objective: \n  \nHere, we (1) defined individualized TMS target location based on functional connectivity of the amygdala-frontopolar circuit while people were exposed to drug-related cues, (2) optimized coil orientation based on maximizing electric field (EF) perpendicular to the individualized target, and (3) harmonized EF strength in targeted brain regions across a population. \n\n\n## Method: \n  \nMRI data including structural, resting-state, and task-based fMRI data were collected from 60 participants with methamphetamine use disorders (MUDs). Craving scores based on a visual analog scale were collected immediately before and after the MRI session. We analyzed inter-subject variability in the location of TMS targets based on the maximum task-based connectivity between the left medial amygdala (with the highest functional activity among subcortical areas during drug cue exposure) and frontopolar cortex using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. Computational head models were generated for all participants and EF simulations were calculated for fixed vs. optimized coil location (Fp1/Fp2 vs. individualized maximal PPI location), orientation (AF7/AF8 vs. orientation optimization algorithm), and stimulation intensity (constant vs. adjusted intensity across the population). \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nLeft medial amygdala with the highest (mean ± SD: 0.31±0.29) functional activity during drug cue exposure was selected as the subcortical seed region. Amygdala-to-whole brain PPI analysis showed a significant cluster in the prefrontal cortex (cluster size: 2462 voxels, cluster peak in MNI space: [25 39 35]) that confirms cortico-subcortical connections. The location of the voxel with the most positive amygdala-frontopolar PPI connectivity in each participant was considered as the individualized TMS target (mean ± SD of the MNI coordinates: [12.6 64.23 −0.8] ± [13.64 3.50 11.01]). Individual amygdala-frontopolar PPI connectivity in each participant showed a significant correlation with VAS scores after cue exposure (  R  =0.27,   p  =0.03). Averaged EF strength in a sphere with r = 5mm around the individualized target location was significantly higher in the optimized (mean ± SD: 0.99 ± 0.21) compared to the fixed approach (Fp1: 0.56 ± 0.22, Fp2: 0.78 ± 0.25) with large effect sizes (Fp1:   p   = 1.1e-13, Hedges’g = 1.5, Fp2:   p   = 1.7e-5, Hedges’g = 1.26). Adjustment factor to have identical 1 V/m EF strength in a 5mm sphere around the individualized targets ranged from 0.72 to 2.3 (mean ± SD: 1.07 ± 0.29). \n\n\n## Conclusion: \n  \nOur results show that optimizing coil orientation and stimulation intensity based on individualized TMS targets led to stronger electric fields in the targeted brain regions compared to a one-size-fits-all approach. These findings provide valuable insights for refining TMS therapy for SUDs by optimizing the modulation of cortico-subcortical circuits. \n\n   Short Abstract  \n## Background: \n  \nPrior research on drug addiction has linked the frontopolar cortex and amygdala coupling to drug cue reactivity/craving. However, one-size-fits-all approaches for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over frontopolar-amygdala have led to inconsistent results. \n\n\n## Objective: \n  \nHere, we (1) defined individualized TMS target location based on functional connectivity of the amygdala-frontopolar circuit while people were exposed to drug-related cues, (2) optimized coil orientation for maximum electric field (EF) perpendicular to the individualized target, and (3) harmonized EF strength in targeted brain regions across a population. \n\n\n## Method: \n  \nMRI data were collected from 60 participants with methamphetamine use disorders (MUDs). and examined the variability in TMS target location based on task-based connectivity between the frontopolar cortex and amygdala. using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. EF simulations were calculated for fixed vs. optimized coil location (Fp1/Fp2 vs. individualized maximal PPI), orientation (AF7/AF8 vs. optimization algorithm), and stimulation intensity (constant vs. adjusted intensity across the population). \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nLeft medial amygdala with the highest (0.31±0.29) fMRI drug cue reactivity was selected as the subcortical seed region. The location of the voxel with the most positive amygdala-frontopolar PPI connectivity in each participant was considered as the individualized TMS target (MNI coordinates: [12.6,64.23,−0.8]±[13.64,3.50,11.01]). Individualized frontopolar-amygdala connectivity showed a significant correlation with VAS craving scores after cue exposure (  R  =0.27,   p  =0.03). Averaged EF strength in a sphere with r=5mm around the individualized target location was significantly higher in the optimized (0.99±0.21V/m) compared to the fixed approach (Fp1:0.56±0.22V/m, Fp2:0.78±0.25V/m) with large effect sizes (Fp1/  p  =1.1e-13,Hedges’g=1.5, Fp2:  p  =1.7e-5,Hedges’g=1.26). Adjustment factor to have identical 1V/m EF strength in a 5mm sphere around the individualized targets ranged from 0.72-to-2.3 (1.07±0.29). \n\n\n## Conclusion: \n  \nOur results show that optimizing coil orientation and stimulation intensity based on individualized TMS targets led to stronger harmonized electric fields in the targeted brain regions compared to a one-size-fits-all method that hopefully helps to refine future TMS therapy for MUDs. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSubstance use disorders (SUDs) are characterized by recurrent, compulsive, and excessive use of drugs that activate the brain’s reward system [ ]. Previous work has implicated both the frontopolar cortex (medial prefrontal cortex, Brodmann Area 10) and the amygdala in substance-associated plasticity through the prefrontal-limbic system [ ]. The amygdala is critical in responses to affective stimuli, and the frontopolar cortex is thought to be involved in tasks that require control of cognition and action [ ]. Amygdala-frontopolar coupling is also recognized as a marker of early relapse risk in people with SUDs[ ]. Both anatomical (white matter tracts) [ ], [ ], [ ] and functional [ ], [ ], [ ] connections between the frontopolar cortex and amygdala were reported in both human and animal studies. The functional connection between these two regions is dynamic and can be modulated with real-time fMRI amygdala neurofeedback [ ], [ ] or frontopolar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) [ ], [ ]. \n\nThe frontopolar cortex is considered a transdiagnostically relevant TMS target that induces local activation of neurons as well as transsynaptic activation of distal functionally/anatomically connected brain regions [ ]. Previous TMS studies showed that excitatory/inhibitory stimulation of the frontopolar area can modulate cortico-subcortical circuits (e.g., frontopolar-amygdala) involved in drug cue reactivity and ultimately decrease drug-related behaviors such as drug craving and consumption [ ]-[ ]. For instance, it has been reported that inhibitory rTMS over the left frontopolar cortex can potentially revert hyperactivity in brain regions related to SUDs including the striatum, insula, and amygdala [ ], [ ], [ ]. Although frontopolar TMS has already been applied clinically for SUDs, little is known about protocol optimization, especially as relating to the inter-individual variability [ ], [ ]. \n\nThe integration of TMS with neuroimaging data, such as fMRI, has advanced our understanding of the functional correlates of TMS by revealing alterations in brain activity/connectivity patterns. This approach helps to utilize between-subject variations in response to stimulation for more precise positioning of the TMS coil over a therapeutic target [ ], [ ]. Previous TMS studies in SUDs used standard scalp-based targeting methods (e.g., EEG standard system) or neuronavigation systems which ignore the heterogeneity of the employed TMS dosage and functional brain network topography [ ]. Current clinical practice for depression identifies the optimal stimulation target using TMS-fMRI integration, shifting the focus from brain anatomical regions to brain circuits at the individual level [ ]-[ ]. It has been observed that anti-depressant outcomes were better when TMS was applied at sites of the DLPFC that showed a stronger negative correlation with the sub-genual cingulate cortex. These findings were corroborated in several studies [ ]-[ ], and the individualized method augmented with depth-corrected stimulation intensity in an accelerated protocol recently received FDA clearance [ ]. Similarly, investigating the effects of functionally guided, connectivity-based rTMS on amygdala activation were also investigated by individually targeting the prefrontal cortex in healthy young adults offered promising preliminary evidence that fMRI-informed targeting may provide a useful approach to treat network dysregulation [ ], [ ]. To improve stimulation accuracy even further, integrating functional connectivity maps with electric field (EF) simulation was also suggested by estimating the changes in connection strength based on inter-individual variability in the head and brain anatomy [ ], [ ]. However, less attention has been paid to optimizing stimulation methods in TMS for SUDs. \n\nInspired by previous functional connectivity maps integrated with EFs for TMS targeting, we believe that individualized stimulation approaches can precisely identify a coordinate in the frontopolar area to effectively modulate the amygdala-frontopolar circuit in individuals with SUDs. We applied this approach to a group of participants with methamphetamine use disorders (MUDs). We aimed to: (1) individualize TMS target location based on functional connectivity of the amygdala-frontopolar circuit during exposure to drug-related cues, (2) optimize coil orientation based on maximizing electric field (EF) perpendicular to the individualized target, and (3) harmonize EF strength in targeted brain regions across 60 participants with MUDs. Our computationally informed method seeks to optimize TMS protocols for SUDs via refined, individually targeted modulation of cortico-subcortical circuits. \n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Participants \n  \n60 participants (all-male, mean age ± standard deviation (SD) = 35.86 ± 8.47 years ranging from 20 to 55) with MUD were recruited during the early abstinence phase (abstinence from methamphetamine for at least 1 week to maximum 6 months) of their participation in a residential recovery program from the 12&12 residential drug addiction treatment center in Tulsa, Oklahoma (Identifier:  ). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before participation and the study was approved by the Western IRB (WIRB Protocol #20171742). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. More details on inclusion/exclusion criteria are in   ( ) [ ]. \n\n\n### Data acquisition procedure \n  \nHigh-resolution structural MRI, resting state fMRI, and fMRI drug cue reactivity task data were collected from all 60 participants on a GE MRI 750 3T scanner. Structural MRI data included T1 and T2-weighted images collected through magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence and were used to create individualized computational head models. During resting-state data collection participants were instructed to relax and stare at a fixation cross, remain awake, and try not to think of anything in particular for 8 minutes. After resting-state data collection, to measure cue-induced brain activity, a standard pictorial block-designed fMRI drug cue reactivity (FDCR) task was administered. Participants were exposed to methamphetamine versus neutral cues (validated in a previous study [ ]). The total task time was approximately 6.5 minutes and contained 4 neutral and 4 methamphetamine picture blocks. Each block included a series of 6 pictures of the same category (methamphetamine or neutral), and each was presented for 5 sec with a 0.2-sec blank inter-stimulus interval. A visual fixation point was presented for 8 to 12 sec between each block. More details on MRI data parameters can be found in   ( ). Self-report craving scores were also collected immediately before and after the MRI session using a visual analog scale (VAS) to measure the severity of the craving (0-100). \n\n\n### Task-based functional activity analysis for defining a subcortical seed \n  \nFunctional data analysis was performed in AFNI. The first three pre-steady state images were removed. The preprocessing steps were as follows: despiking, slice timing correction, realignment, transformation to MNI space, and 4 mm of Gaussian FWHM smoothing. Three polynomial terms and the six motion parameters were regressed-out. TRs with excessive motion (defined as the Euclidian norm of the derivative of the six motion parameters being greater than 0.3) were censored during regression. Statistical analysis of individual imaging data was performed using a first-level fixed effects analysis, in the context of the General Linear Model (GLM). For each participant, a contrast image of methamphetamine > neutral was constructed and a voxel-wise whole-brain analysis was used to identify the effect of the condition (methamphetamine>neutral) and reported P < 0.001. For each participant, Brainnetome atlas parcellation, with a total of 246 cortical and subcortical areas, was applied, and mean beta weight values were estimated for all subregions [ ]. The amygdala sub-regions (including left and right medial and lateral amygdala) obtained from the Brainnetime atlas-based parcellation of the fMRI data with the maximum functional activation related to methamphetamine cue reactivity was selected as the seed region that would be modulated by TMS through cortico-subcortical circuits. \n\n\n### Task-based functional connectivity analysis for defining an individualized cortical target \n  \nTask-based functional connectivity analysis was performed using the CONN toolbox (v.20.b) [ ] in SPM 12. FDCR data underwent a standard preprocessing pipeline in CONN which includes slice timing correction, realignment, co-registration, spatial normalization, and smoothing with an 8mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Seed-to-whole brain generalized psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis (a bivariate regression analysis for task-based connectivity calculations [ ]) was performed on the left medial amygdala as the seed. PPI analysis identifies brain regions whose connectivity with the seed region varies as a function of psychological context (here, reactivity to methamphetamine vs. neutral cues). At the first level, the physiological regressors of interest were the timings of methamphetamine and neutral blocks in the task convolved with a hemodynamic response function. The physiological regressor was calculated as the mean time series of the seed region, namely, the left medial amygdala (Brainnetome mask). The PPI regressors were the interaction terms between psychological and physiological regressors, namely, (methamphetamine×physiological) and (neutral×physiological), and the contrast of interest (methamphetamine×physiological) vs (neutral×physiological). These were estimated for each participant to determine which voxels work together with the seed region during the methamphetamine vs. neutral condition. The second level PPI analysis was also performed to determine the significant clusters using voxel-wise and cluster-extent thresholds. Active clusters were reported when surviving a voxel-level statistical threshold of two-sided t-value>3.1 and cluster-level threshold of cluster size>60 voxels. \n\nBased on first-level PPI connectivity maps, we respectively computed personalized TMS targets within the frontopolar area; its mask was obtained from the results reported by Bludau et al. [ ]. As there was no specific laterality in previous TMS studies in the field of SUDs, both left and right hemispheres and lateral and medial parts of the frontopolar were searched to find the maximum connection between the amygdala and frontopolar cortex. The voxel with the strongest positive PPI connectivity (Beta values for the PPI regressor as defined in the previous paragraph) to the subcortical area with the highest functional activity during drug cue exposure was selected as the individualized TMS target for each individual. \n\n\n### Construction of head models \n  \nComputational head models were generated for all participants using finite element modeling (FEM) implemented in SimNIBS 3.2 standard pipeline [ ]. Briefly, T1 and T2 weighted MRI data were used to generate anatomically accurate models based on “headreco” option with the SPM 12 toolbox for tissue segmentation. The constructed head meshes consisted of six tissue types: white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), eyeballs, skull, and scalp with fixed conductivity values; as per the SimNIBS defaults (WM = 0.126 Siemens/meter (S/m), GM = 0.275 S/m, CSF = 1.654 S/m, skull = 0.01 S/m, scalp = 0.465 S/m, and eyeballs = 0.5 S/m) [ ]. The results were visualized using Gmsh and MATLAB. \n\nTo investigate possible effects due to individualized fMRI-informed TMS targeting, three sets of EF distribution patterns were simulated. (a) F  ixed Fp2 approach  : in the first set of simulations, EEG 10-10 system Fp2 electrode was selected to target the right frontopolar with fixed standard orientation (y direction toward AF8) across the population in a one-size-fits-all manner (inspired by [ ], [ ]), (b)   Fixed Fp1 approach:   in the second set of simulations, EEG 10-10 system Fp1 electrode was selected to target the left frontopolar with fixed standard orientation (y direction towards AF7) across the population in a one-size-fits-all manner (inspired by [ ], [ ], [ ]). These two approaches were commonly used for targeting the frontopolar area in previous TMS studies for SUDs [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ]. (c)   Optimized approach  : optimization was performed at three levels: (1) location, (2) orientation, and (3) intensity. The individualized fMRI-informed approach was used in the third set of simulations. TMS coil was placed over the individualized cortical coordinate obtained from maximum task-based functional connectivity between the amygdala and frontopolar cortex. Coil orientation was then optimized for each person to maximize the EF perpendicular to the targeted brain coordinate using the Auxiliary Dipole Method (ADM) [ ] embedded in SimNIBS. These three sets of simulations enabled us to make more direct comparisons between optimized fMRI-informed and fixed TMS targeting, minimizing extraneous methodological differences. Location and value of the 99  percentile of the EFs were calculated for each person and, with respect to the linearity and superposition principle, individualized stimulation intensity was suggested to have similar EF strength (e.g., 1 V/m) in targeted brain regions across the population. \n\nOf the various coil models available in SimNIBS, primary EFs were calculated using a Magstim 70mm Figure-of-eight coil, which is the most common coil type in both clinical and research settings. Mean, median, and peak EF strength were extracted in a 5mm sphere around the individualized targets in each set of simulations. Results were compared using ANOVA with paired sample t-tests as post hoc analyses. \n\n\n### Behavioral analysis \n  \nCue-induced craving was assessed by measuring changes from before to after cue presentation. Self-report craving (“How much craving do you have right now?”) scores were quantified using a visual analog scale (VAS; ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 = no craving and 100 = the highest craving). The correlation between VAS scores and individualized amygdala-frontopolar PPI connectivity strength was calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The study procedure is summarized in  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Task-based functional activity results \n  \nFunctional activity analysis using GLM and Brainnetome atlas parcellation are visualized in  . The level of brain activation (mean ± SD) in methamphetamine>neutral contrast was extracted from each subregion across the sample. Among all subcortical areas (amygdala, hippocamp, thalamus, and basal ganglia), our results based on beta values showed a high level of activation in the amygdala with the highest activity in the left medial amygdala (mean ± SD: 0.31±0.29) ranging from −0.47 to 1.14. The mask of this brain region was selected as a seed for further functional connectivity analysis. \n\n\n### Task-based functional connectivity results \n  \nBased on the results obtained from functional activity the left medial amygdala was selected as the subcortical seed region. Seed-to-whole brain PPI analyses showed a significant cluster in the right frontopolar cortex survived the voxel-level statistical threshold of two-sided t-value>3.1 and cluster-level threshold of cluster size>60 voxels that showed increased PPI connectivity to amygdala while participants were exposed to drug vs. neutral cues; cluster size: 2462 voxels, cluster peak in MNI space: [25 39 35] ( ). \n\nThe coordinate of the maximal PPI connectivity with the left medial amygdala located inside the right medial frontopolar cortex was also determined for each person. Inter-individual variabilities were found in both locations (mean ± SD of the MNI coordinates: [12.60 64.23 −0.8] ± [13.64 3.49 11.01]) and strength (mean ± SD: 1.69 ± 0.96) of the maximal PPI connections across the population. Individualized coordinates were located in a cube with a volume of 63.13mm  and PPI strength (beta values in the bivariate regression defined in  .) ranged from 0.26 to 5.62 across 60 participants ( ). \n\n\n### Electric field simulations \n  \nThree sets of computational head models were generated for all 60 participants (See  .). One-way ANOVA showed significant effects for the coil placement approach for all indices (mean (  F   = 50.25,   p   = 2e-16), peak (  F   = 18.08,   p   = 7.7e-8), and median (  F   = 31.77,   p   = 1.98e-12)) extracted from the 5mm spheres. Post hoc pairwise t-test analyses showed that mean EFs in the optimized approach (mean ± SD: 0.99 ± 0.21) were significantly higher than both fixed Fp1 and Fp2 approaches with large effect sizes (Fp1: mean = 0.56 ± 0.22,   p   = 1.1e-13, Hedges’g = 1.50 with 95% of CI (1.12,1.88); Fp2: mean = 0.78 ± 0.25,   p   = 1.7e-5, Hedges’g = 1.26 with 95% of CI (0.91,1.16)). We also found that peak EFs (99  percentiles) in the optimized approach (max = 2.06 ± 0.79) were significantly higher than fixed Fp1 (max = 1.21 ± 0.71,   p   = 5.9e-9) and Fp2 (mean ± SD = 0.78 ± 0.25,   p   = 8.3e-4) with large effect sizes (Fp1: Hedges’g = 1.31 with 95% of CI (0.95,1.66), Fp2: Hedges’g = 1.08 with 95% of CI (0.75,1.41)). Median EF strength was also significantly higher in optimized (median = 0.59 ± 0.17) compared to fixed Fp1 (median = 0.34 ± 0.16,   p   = 8e-5) and Fp2 (median = 0.46 ± 0.18,   p   = 6.2e-5)) with large effect sizes (Fp1: Hedges’g = 1.42 with 95% of CI (1.05,1.79), Fp2: Hedges’g = 1.06 with 95% of CI (0.73,1.38)). Averaged EF strength was also extracted from a 5mm sphere around the individualized targets for each person (ranged from 0.42 to 1.43 V/m). Stimulation intensity was adjusted to have 1 V/m in a 5mm sphere around individualized targeted brain regions across the population. \n\n\n### Behavioral results \n  \nCraving scores showed a significant (  p   = 0.00017) increase from before (mean ± SD: 40.95 ± 30.89) to after (61.73 ± 31.11) drug cue exposure with a large effect size (Hedges’g = 0.82 with 95% of CI (0.61,1.03)) ( ). VAS score after drug cue exposure showed a significant correlation with maximal amygdala-frontopolar PPI connectivity (  R   = 0.27,   p   = 0.034) ( ). We excluded one participant as an outlier (with PPI = 5.62, VAS-before = 86, VAS-after = 95), however, the Pearson correlation results remained nearly significant (  R   = 0.24,   p   = 0.06). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere, we explained how structural and functional MRI can be used to identify stimulation parameters for TMS targets and optimize electric field/dose (EF) distribution patterns across a population with methamphetamine use disorder (MUDs) ( ). Specifically, this investigation yielded five main results. First, the left medial amygdala showed the highest functional activity during drug cue exposure and was selected as the subcortical seed region. Second, amygdala-to-whole brain PPI analysis showed a significant cluster in the frontopolar/medial prefrontal cortex that confirms cortico-subcortical connections during drug cue exposure. Third, the location of the voxel with the most positive amygdala-frontopolar PPI connectivity in each participant was considered as the individualized TMS target and individual amygdala-frontopolar PPI connectivity in each participant showed a significant correlation with VAS scores after cue exposure. Fourth, the average EF strength in a sphere with r = 5mm around the individualized target location was significantly higher in the optimized compared to the fixed approach with large effect sizes. Finally, stimulation intensity was adjusted for each person to have harmonized to have identical EF intensity over personalized targets for all participants. \n\n### Neural substrate of drug cue reactivity: hyperactivity in the amygdala \n  \nOur functional activity analysis of the drug cue reactivity task ( ) showed strong activation in all amygdala subregions, with the highest activation in the left medial amygdala while participants were exposed to drug vs. neutral cues. Our results are in accordance with previous studies that suggest the presentation of drug cues appears to reliably activate brain regions involved in the reward/motivation network, including the ventral striatum and amygdala [ ], [ ], [ ]. In this study, the left medial amygdala was chosen as the subcortical seed region due to its highest activation during drug cue exposure. This selection is supported by previous research indicating that amygdala activation in response to drug cue exposure plays a critical role in drug-related behaviors [ ]-[ ], such that cue-induced craving score is correlated with activation in the amygdala when people were exposed to drug cues [ ]. Furthermore, the effectiveness of interventions such as cue exposure therapy [ ] or methadone maintenance treatment [ ] in reducing cue reactivity in the amygdala provides further support for our seed selection. \n\n\n### Connections between the amygdala and prefrontal areas in SUDs \n  \nHere, we focused on frontopolar-amygdala circuits as a potential TMS target in SUDs and tried to find individualized coordinates to optimally target this brain circuit. Although TMS cannot directly modulate the activity of deeper brain areas like the amygdala, its effects can spread through brain networks [ ], [ ]. Our amygdala-to-whole brain PPI analysis also supported this idea by revealing a significant positive cluster (increased PPI connections) in the frontopolar/medial prefrontal cortex with a peak activation in the frontopolar cortex ( ). This finding confirms cortico-subcortical pathways between the prefrontal amygdala and is in line with previous studies that reported functional connections between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala during drug cue processing [ ]. \n\nFurthermore, previous studies support our assumption for considering the frontopolar-amygdala circuit as a TMS target for SUDs from different perspectives. (1) Accumulating data highlights the frontopolar cortex as a promising therapeutic target for TMS in SUDs (e.g., lesion-based studies [ ], tES studies [ ], TMS studies [ ]). (2) It has been reported that impairment in functional coupling between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala is negatively correlated with the ability to control negative emotions [ ]. (3) Optogenetic studies in male rats showed that chronic alcohol exposure decreased frontopolar-amygdala synaptic strength and accommodation and introduced this brain circuitry as a significant target of the alcohol-associated plasticity [ ]. (4) Resting-state fMRI analysis also supported frontopolar-amygdala coupling as a marker of relapse in participants with cocaine use disorders [ ]. It has been reported that early relapse risk is associated with reduced connectivity between the left cortico-medial amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (comparable to the brain region identified as the frontopolar in our study). In that study, even the site of the amygdala (left medial) is consistent with our results [ ]. (5) It has been reported that the frontopolar cortex triggered plasticity events inside the amygdala that plays an important role in the extinction of drug-seeking behaviors [ ]. Taken together, all of these findings support the potential for engagement of the amygdala through frontopolar-amygdala functional pathways in the SUD treatment [ ], [ ], [ ], and highlight the necessity of effective TMS protocols for future clinical trials in the field. \n\n\n### Individualized circuit-based targeting \n  \nColi localization is an important factor in TMS studies. Here, we investigated how far the optimal fMRI-informed target deviates from the fixed EEG-based target which is commonly used. Our individualized approach calculated coordinates for targeting drug-cue-relevant frontopolar-amygdala for each person. In contrast to fixed targeting methods, our results showed notable inter-individual variability in terms of the target locations.   showed that this distance was different between individuals. In line with previous findings in connectivity-based target selection [ ], [ ], these findings reveal variations in the frontopolar coordinate connected to the amygdala, which could potentially explain some of the inter-individual variability observed previously in response to TMS targeting frontopolar cortex for SUDs [ ]. Results highlight the importance of coil location optimization in circuit-based stimulation and indicate that anatomical and functional information could be used to estimate the optimal coil position for targeting the frontopolar cortex. \n\nWe considered the strongest positive z-value in the connection between the amygdala and frontopolar as the TMS target. Because it has been reported that inhibitory rTMS over the frontopolar can potentially revert hyperactivity in brain subcortical regions such as the amygdala [ ], [ ], [ ], and based on the common frequency-dependent effects of rTMS, we expect that inhibitory stimulation to a positively connected frontopolar node would dampen the positive connectivity between the frontopolar and amygdala, a change that could potentially reduce drug-related behaviors like drug craving and consumption. We also found a positive significant correlation between the most positive amygdala-frontopolar PPI connectivity and self-reported craving scores after drug cue exposure ( , people with stronger connectivity reported a higher cue-induced craving score). This finding supports our assumption and suggests that inhibitory stimulation over the coordinates with the most positive connections to the amygdala might be successful in reducing craving scores. Future research should include clinical testing of different TMS targeting methods to understand the comparative effects of each technique on behavioral outcomes. \n\n\n### Optimizing coil orientation \n  \nHere, we optimized coil orientation over personalized TMS targets in the frontopolar area. Due to the presence of measurable markers such as motor-evoked potential, the optimal coil orientation is well-known for the motor cortex while the optimal coil orientation remains to be determined for other brain areas [ ]. Furthermore, although there is an increasing number of fMRI-informed TMS studies to determine coil location for each person, less attention has been paid to optimizing coil orientation in previously published clinical trials [ ], [ ], [ ]. Our results showed that coil orientation optimization significantly increased EF strength over the frontopolar cortex compared to fixed orientation, which is commonly used in TMS studies. Our results suggest that coil angle optimization based on the anatomical shape of the head should be considered for estimating the most effective stimulation parameters over the frontopolar cortex as supported by previous TMS studies in other brain targets like motor cortex [ ], [ ]. \n\n\n### Harmonizing EF strength across the sample \n  \nOur simulations with a fixed TMS dose showed inter-individual variability at the cortical target site ( ). In line with previous modeling studies, at the cortical target site, in both fixed and individualized fMRI-informed locations, intensities substantially varied between individuals [ ], [ ]. Our findings support that fixed-dose TMS which is typically used in clinical trials may result in varying physiological or behavioral effects among individuals. As suggested by Evans et al controlling for this source of variability must be a priority [ ]. Therefore, we adjusted the stimulation intensity for each individual to control the stimulation dose and reduce EF variability in the targeted brain region. As expected, by individualizing the dose, the EF was consistent near the target site and reached a specific target intensity. Here, inspired by [ ], we adjusted stimulation intensity to harmonize EF across individuals with the assumption that there is a straightforward (linear) dose-response relationship between the physiological/behavioral effects of TMS and the delivered stimulation dose in the targeted brain region. Hence, we controlled the EF that was delivered to each personalized target location. Our assumption is supported by previous studies suggesting that EF intensity in a cortical target predicts response to the applied brain stimulation technology [ ], [ ]. However, other factors such as EF direction in the targeted area, the spatial extent of the EF in each person, above threshold EF intensity in non-targeted brain regions, or ongoing brain state may be relevant to the observed response. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nOur study has some limitations that could be addressed in future research. First, whether frontopolar-amygdala connectivity is the clinically optimal target for MUDs remains an open question. Although there are promising results in previous frontopolar-amygdala connectivity-based TMS in healthy young adults [ ], the fMRI-informed target selection approach is still new in the field of brain stimulation for SUDs [ ]. Replication in larger cohorts to draw a general conclusion about the optimal cortico-subcortical biomarker is needed that can be informative for predictive/treatment-response biomarker extraction in future TMS studies. \n\nSecond, our study did not include manipulation of the targeted circuit with TMS. Prospective research testing the proposed optimized targeting approach needs to be tested in future studies by collecting fMRI before and after optimized rTMS and comparing the results with a non-optimized approach (e.g., fixed standard method) to test for BOLD and connectivity changes due to stimulation and how each approach affects behavioral outcomes, e.g., craving. \n\nThird, we only investigated task-based fMRI data to engage the fronto-limbic network and induce Hebbian-like plasticity [ ]. Others have focused on resting-state fMRI data collection [ ], [ ] to reduce the need for participant compliance and avoid confounds related to task performance or instructions [ ]. fMRI-informed TMS target selection based on resting-state networks may exhibit higher reproducibility compared to conventional task-based imaging [ ]. Direct comparisons of task-based vs. resting-state-defined TMS network targeting will be important in future SUD research. \n\nFourth, we created computational head models only based on T1 and T2-weighted images with previously established isotropic conductivities, as is common in computational studies. Anisotropic skull and white matter conductivities significantly affect EF distribution patterns [ ] which is important when considering deeper target regions inside the brain [ ]. Anisotropic conductivities could be calculated based on diffusion tensor imaging in future studies to increase the accuracy of computational head modeling as it has been shown that in TMS simulations anisotropy led to differences up to 10% in the maximum induced EFs [ ]. Furthermore, we used constant tissue conductivities while variations in reported human head tissue electrical conductivity values may have effects on simulation outcomes [ ]. Although assuming conductivity from the literature is insufficient, obtaining the personalized values at body temperature at frequencies<100Hz and in natural, in-vivo conditions would be difficult and unavailable. Other physiological factors such as motor-evoked potentials that could be partly explained by EFs in the motor cortex can be used for future dose-controlled TMS studies [ ]. \n\nWe focused only on coil location, orientation, and stimulation intensity harmonization across the population. However, there is a large TMS parameter space, and many other factors can affect stimulation outcomes that could be considered in future studies. For example, in a TMS clinical trial, train duration, inter-train interval, pulse numbers, session number, pulse width, pulse shape, and frequency could be optimized for each individual by considering initial brain state, EF distribution patterns, and behavioral outcomes. \n\nHere, our sample only consisted of male participants. Previous studies on brain stimulation and substance use disorders have reported on the impact of sex differences on electric field distribution patterns and brain functions [ ], [ ]. It is recommended to include both males and females in future research to ensure the findings are representative of the entire population. \n\nFuture dose-response studies could be informative to optimize all related factors for each individual or across a population based on the association between the stimulation parameter and stimulation efficacy [ ], [ ]. For example, an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve was reported by Huang et al., for the number of stimulation pulses such that 600 pulses produced a more durable response than 300, while 1200 pulses produced inhibitory effects rather than increasing the effects of 600 pulses [ ]. Dose-response relationship studies can be leveraged to design new TMS parameters that optimally manipulate brain responses in future clinical trials. \n\nFinally, future closed-loop TMS-fMRI systems that allow automatic adjustment of the stimulation location and orientation, e.g., with a robotically controlled stimulator, raise the possibility of real-time optimization of the coil location, orientation, and stimulation intensity/frequency based on personalized ongoing brain state. Automated closed-loop TMS-fMRI with a suitable optimization algorithm implementation help to adaptively adjust stimulation parameters in a multidimensional search space [ ]. However, an MRI-compatible device, a high-speed optimization algorithm, and powerful computational resources for generating and analysis of head models are needed to implement closed-loop TMS-fMRI systems. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe effectiveness of non-invasive brain stimulation technologies like TMS is limited by individual differences in response. This study aimed to improve TMS outcomes by customizing stimulation parameters based on individual variability of functional connectivity parameters. The study found that personalized TMS targets can improve connectivity between the amygdala and frontopolar circuits, which are important for regulating addiction-related behaviors. Furthermore, our proposed circuit was consistent with a previously reported circuit that was identified as a predictor of relapse status [ ]. Thus, the study emphasizes the importance of individualized coil placement, orientation, and stimulation intensity adjustment. These findings can help refine TMS therapy for substance use disorders, and future research should investigate whether this approach can improve neural and behavioral outcomes in clinical trials. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"cc079696bfb0ea151d3c47a89c9eecfb"},

Accordingly, FC‐based predictions of diagnosis group achieved accuracy levels around chance. However, using the same approaches to predict scan type (rest vs. video) achieved near‐perfect accuracy. Our findings suggest that neither the limitations of resting state as a “task,” data resolution, data quantity, or scan duration can be considered solely responsible for failures to differentiate ASD from TD functional connectomes. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nRecent years have seen widespread interest in the potential for functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) to serve as a biomarker or neuroendophenotype for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, despite this enthusiasm, existing studies have failed to differentiate individuals with ASD from typically developing controls (TD) with sufficiently high in‐sample or out‐of‐sample accuracy to meet biomarker standards (Abraham et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Heinsfeld, Franco, Craddock, Buchweitz, & Meneguzzi,  ; Nielsen et al.,  ; Plitt, Barnes, & Martin,  ; Yahata et al.,  ), and findings of group‐level differences between ASD and TD groups have been inconsistent across studies and include many negative results (Tyszka, Kennedy, Paul, & Adolphs,  ; Dajani et al.,  ; He, Byrge, & Kennedy,  ; for review see Hull, Jacokes, Torgerson, Irimia, & Van Horn,  ). \n\nMany factors could underlie this overall pattern of results, including (but not limited to) the following. First, most such studies have examined fcMRI data collected during the resting state, but such a task‐free state may not be sufficiently constrained or, alternatively, not sufficiently related to the behavioral presentation of ASD, to give rise to shared atypical patterns of brain functioning. Second, while data that are collected over longer scans and with more data points (Birn et al.,  ; Horien et al.,  ; Laumann et al.,  ) permit the most precise estimates of functional connectivity at the individual level, and accordingly many scanning initiatives are collecting more and more data points per individual with higher temporal resolution (Gordon et al.,  ; Laumann et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ), existing studies of fcMRI in ASD typically use lower‐resolution imaging protocols and short scan durations, suggesting that estimates of functional connectivity in the literature may not be sufficiently precise to accurately discriminate diagnostic groups. Further, given the likelihood of lower data quality in clinical populations, and thus less usable data, precision and consistency of individual FC estimates may vary between groups, potentially giving rise to less accurate estimates of connectivity in the ASD group. \n\nHere, we report on a new study of individuals with ASD and controls with several key advances designed to address these potential factors. In contrast to the existing literature, here we collect data not only during the resting state but also while individuals watch videos with varied social content in the scanner, which should constrain evoked brain activity and may relate more to atypical social behavior than the resting state. Also in contrast to the existing literature, which predominantly examines a single low temporal resolution (TR 2–3 s) 5–6 min resting‐state fcMRI scan per individual, here we collect for each individual up to eight high‐resolution multiband scans (TR 0.813 s), 13–16 min each, for up to 2 hr of data over two sessions—about 20 times more scanning time and 50 times more data points per individual than most existing studies of ASD. Our overarching goal was to either better differentiate functional connectomes at the group level or, alternatively, refine our understanding of the factors that are more or less likely to be responsible for inconsistency and negative results in the existing literature. In so doing, we asked: (a) are functional connectomes individually discriminable and consistent in both diagnosis groups; (b) are functional connectomes more similar within groups and do they show common group‐specific patterns; and (c) can groups be differentiated, and if so, does video watching or rest allow for better separation of the groups? \n\nFunctional imaging in special populations always requires difficult tradeoffs. Analyzing high‐quality data is paramount (see, e.g., Deen & Pelphrey,  ), yet frequently requires excluding more scans and more subjects than is desirable, limiting generalizability and discarding expensive and unique data. Retaining more subjects may increase generalizability, but at the cost of increased difficulty in disentangling potential effects of diagnosis from those of data quality. Here, we have attempted to bridge that trade‐off by reporting results in multiple ways. In the main text, we report results from a small sample with the highest quality data, using the strictest data inclusion thresholds. In this sample, some reliable group differences in head motion (as indexed using filtered framewise displacement or FD , see Methods) remained. In the Supporting Information, we further address residual effects of data quality by downsampling each rest scan such that no group differences in FD  remained, yielding the equivalent of about 5 min of low‐temporal‐resolution data (comparable to the existing ASD fcMRI literature) of the highest quality. We also report in the Supporting Information results from a larger, more inclusive sample with a more relaxed censoring threshold. Finally, we also report results under several additional preprocessing alternatives. Results were generally consistent across approaches. \n\nTo preview our results, we obtained functional connectivity estimates that were highly discriminable, allowing for near‐perfect “fingerprinting” or individual identification regardless of diagnosis group, and these functional connectomes were consistent within individuals and equally so in both groups. However, while it might have been expected that dissimilarities to TD functional connectivity patterns would be observable in the ASD group, we did not observe any such reductions in similarity to TD FC patterns robustly or consistently at the group level, although very small reductions were observed in a few isolated preprocessing approaches. We found no consistent atypical FC patterns shared across the ASD group. Prediction of diagnosis group from functional connectomes, using the complete connectome as well as a targeted selection of edges, achieved accuracy not far from chance. However, these same prediction approaches achieved near perfect accuracy when applied to scan type (rest vs. video) irrespective of group. Overall, our findings suggest that none of the potential factors we identified and addressed can be considered fully responsible for the failures in the literature to robustly and consistently differentiate ASD and TD functional connectomes. Despite adding a constrained and socially relevant task and increasing scan resolution, duration, and temporal samples, which resulted in discriminable and consistent FC estimates and near‐perfect prediction of scan type, successful discrimination between ASD and TD connectomes was not achieved. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants included 25 high‐functioning adults with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD; mean age 24.2; range 17–54; 6 female) and 29 age‐ and full‐scale IQ‐matched controls (TD; mean age 24.5; range 19–37; 5 female), recruited from Bloomington, IN and surrounding areas. All ASD participants had previously received DSM‐IV community diagnoses of autism, Asperger's Syndrome, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder‐Not Otherwise Specified (PDD‐NOS), and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS‐2; Lord et al.,  ) was administered and scored by research reliable administrators at the time of study recruitment. All participants were administered Module 4 (the version appropriate for verbally fluent adults). We used the revised scoring algorithm that has improved diagnostic specificity over the previously used scoring algorithms (Hus & Lord,  ). All participants exceeded the cutoff of 8 (combined social affect [SA] and restricted and repetitive behaviors [RRB] domains), with a mean score of 13.25 (  SD   = 3.08) (mean SA = 10.5 [2.84]; mean RRB = 2.75 [1.45]). We also administered the Autism‐Spectrum Quotient (AQ; Baron‐Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley,  ) and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition (Wechsler,  ). All subjects provided written informed consent; all experimental procedures were approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board. \n\nAfter initial subject‐level exclusions due to consistently poor data quality (  N   = 4 ASD subjects) and then scan‐level exclusions due to excessive censoring (more than 30% of scan censored at time points with filtered framewise displacement [FD ] exceeding 0.2 mm) and insufficient (fewer than 3) scans of each type remaining after censoring, the remaining primary sample included 16 individuals with ASD (14 with at least 3 rest and at least 3 video scans; 1 with 3 rest scans only; 1 with 3 video scans only) and 28 TD individuals (27 with at least 3 rest and at least 3 video scans; 1 with 3 video scans only). In the analyzed sample, there were no group differences in age at time of scanning (ASD group: Mdn 298.5 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 110.5); TD group: Mdn: 279.5 months [IQR: 63.5];   U   = 197,   z   = .65,   p   > .5) or IQ (ASD group: Mdn: 118.5 [IQR: 16.5]; TD group Mdn: 115 [IQR: 14.5];   U   = 196,   z   = .67,   p   > .5). As expected, AQ differed between groups (ASD: Mdn 33 [IQR 14], TD: Mdn 17 [IQR 5.5],   U   = 27.5,   z   = 4.8,   p   < .001) and the median ADOS score in the ASD group was 8.5 (IQR 3) (or 11 [IQR 3] using the revised scoring algorithm). \n\nWe also repeated the primary analyses with a more relaxed censoring threshold (FD  > 0.5 mm) in order to include more data particularly from ASD subjects. This sample included 20 individuals with ASD (19 with at least 3 rest and at least 3 video scans and 1 with 3 video scans only) and 29 TD individuals (25 with at least 3 rest and at least 3 video scans, 3 with 4 video scans only, and 1 with 4 video scans only; see Supporting Information for further detail). The remaining supplemental analyses used the primary sample of individuals. \n\n\n### Design \n  \nThe study design consisted of two scanning sessions separated by approximately 1 week (mean 9.3 days between scan sessions,   SD   6). Both scanning sessions consisted of two resting‐state scans and two video‐watching scans, interleaved starting with rest. All rest scans were approximately 16 min long (1,200 TRs); video scans were approximately 13–14 min long (1,000, 952, 1,026, and 977 TRs). Subjects were instructed to move as little as possible and remain awake with eyes open. \n\nNo visual stimulus was provided during resting state scans. Stimuli for video scans were concatenated short video trailers, with no repetition of specific trailers across sessions. All trailers were obtained from Vimeo ( ). They were selected based on multiple criteria. First, to ensure that videos represented novel stimuli, we excluded any trailer that had a wide theatrical release. Second, we excluded videos with potentially objectionable content (i.e., nudity, swearing, and drug use). Finally, we excluded videos with intentionally startling events that could lead to excessive in‐scanner movement. Each trailer lasted between 45 and 285 s (approximately 1–5 min). Each video scan comprised between four and six trailers with genres that included documentaries, dramas, comedies, sports, mystery, and adventure. Video was back‐projected onto a screen that was visible to subjects via a mirror attached to the head coil. Audio was provided via MR‐compatible headphones. \n\nWakefulness was monitored via an MR‐compatible video camera; scans in which participants fell asleep were excluded from analysis (10 scans total; 5 from 2 ASD participants and 4 from 4 TD participants). One additional TD scan was excluded due to a technical issue. The final primary sample analyzed included multiple scans for most participants (304 scans analyzed, mean 3.4 [  SD   1.28] resting‐state runs and mean 3.5 [  SD   1.17] video runs per participant). (For the supplemental analyses, less strictly censored sample: 361 scans analyzed with mean 3.71 [  SD   = 0.84] rest scans and mean 3.65 [  SD   = 0.99] video scans per participant). Anatomical images were acquired after functional runs, during which participants were able to watch a video of their choosing. \n\n\n### Data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nAcquisition and preprocessing were detailed in Byrge and Kennedy ( ) and repeated here. MRI images were acquired using a 3 Tesla whole‐body MRI system (Magnetom Tim Trio, Siemens Medical Solutions, Natick, MA) with a 32‐channel head receive array, using a protocol designed to be similar (but not identical due in large part to hardware constraints) to the Human Connectome Project (Smith et al.,  ). Both raw and prescan‐normalized images were acquired; raw images were used at all preprocessing stages and in all analyses unless specifically noted. During functional scans, T *‐weighted multiband echo planar imaging (EPI) data were acquired using the following parameters: TR/TE = 813/28 ms; flip angle = 60°; 3.4 mm isotropic voxels; 42 slices acquired with interleaved order covering the whole brain; multi‐band acceleration factor of 3. The number of volumes varied: rest functional scans were 1,200 volumes; video functional scans were 1,000, 952, 1,026, and 977 volumes. Preceding the first functional scan, gradient‐echo EPI images were acquired in opposite phase‐encoding directions (10 images each with P‐A and A‐P phase encoding) with identical geometry to the EPI data (TR/TE = 1175/39.2 ms, flip angle = 60°) to be used to generate a fieldmap to correct EPI distortions, similar to the approach used by the Human Connectome Project (Smith et al.,  ). High‐resolution T ‐weighted images of the whole brain (MPRAGE, 0.7 mm isotropic voxel size; TR/TE/TI = 2499/2.3/1000 ms) were acquired as anatomical references. \n\nData were preprocessed with an in‐house pipeline using FEAT (v6.00) and MELODIC (v3.14) within FSL (v. 5.0.8; FMRIB's Software Library,  ), Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs; v2.1.0) (Avants et al.,  ), and Matlab_R2014b. \n\nIndividual anatomical images were bias‐corrected and skull‐stripped using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs), and segmented into gray matter, white matter, and CSF partial volume estimates using FSL FAST. From 20 randomly selected anatomical images (10 TD; 10 ASD), a midspace template was constructed using ANTs'   buildtemplateparallel   tool and then skull‐stripped. Composite (affine and diffeomorphic) transforms warping each individual anatomical image to this midspace template and warping the midspace template to the Montreal Neurological Institute MNI152 1 mm reference template were obtained using ANTs. \n\nThe initial five volumes (~4 s) of each functional run were discarded to minimize magnetization equilibration effects. We conducted rigid‐body motion correction, field map‐based geometric distortion correction, and nonbrain removal but not slice‐timing correction (due to the fast TR; Smith et al.,  ). Initial preprocessing also included weak high‐pass temporal filtering (>2,000 s FWHM) to remove slow drifts (as in Smith et al.,  ) but no spatial smoothing. Off‐resonance geometric distortions in the EPI data were corrected using a fieldmap derived from two gradient‐echo EPI images collected in opposite phase‐encoding directions (P‐A and A‐P) using FSL topup (similar to the study by Smith et al.,  ). \n\nAs reported in earlier work (Byrge & Kennedy,  ), we evaluated a number of different preprocessing approaches on this data set and report here for the primary results the preprocessing approach that best removed lagged residual noise: FIX+MGTR, or FIX followed by mean cortical signal regression (equivalently, mean grayordinate time series regression or “MGTR,” following Burgess et al.,  ) in a second step. First, we employed FSL‐FIX (Salimi‐Khorshidi et al.,  ) to regress out independent components classified as noise by a classifier trained on independent but similar data and validated on hand‐classified functional runs. Then, the mean cortical signal (the mean BOLD signal across the individuals' gray matter partial volume estimate obtained from FSL FAST) was regressed from the residuals following FIX in a second step (as in Burgess et al.,  ), and the resulting residuals were analyzed as the cleaned data. Due to the controversy surrounding global signal regression (Murphy & Fox,  ; Power, Plitt, Laumann, & Martin,  ), we also repeated the primary analyses using FIX without MGTR in the Supporting Information). \n\nRegistration of cleaned functional data occurred as follows. An affine transformation matrix registering the mean prescan‐normalized functional image to each subject's skull‐stripped T ‐weighted anatomical image was obtained using Boundary‐Based Registration (BBR) via   epi_reg   within FSL. (The mean prescan‐normalized images yielded more accurate alignment than the raw functional images, due to the reduced contrast in fast‐TR EPI data; see also Smith et al.,  ). Next, each subject's functional images were transformed to the MNI152 reference all in one step, using ANTS to apply a concatenation of this affine transformation matrix with the composite (affine + diffeomorphic) transforms mapping between the subject's anatomical image, the midspace template, and the MNI152 reference. \n\nWe obtained region of interest time series using a 114‐region‐of‐interest (ROI) cortical parcellation anatomically subdividing the Yeo 17 functional networks (Yeo et al.,  ) and described more fully in the study by Betzel et al. ( ). (We also repeated the primary analyses using a second ROI set, the cortical Harvard‐Oxford parcellation distributed with FSL, subdivided by hemisphere into 96 ROIs, as reported in the Supporting Information). Individual ROI masks were created for each subject from the product of the individuals' gray matter partial volume estimate and the region of interest mask (as in the study by Tyszka et al.,  ). The weighted mean signal across each individual region of interest mask was then extracted from the cleaned BOLD signal for each functional run. These time courses together were used to construct functional connectivity matrices. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Functional connectome construction \n  \nMotion censoring/scrubbing prior to connectome construction was performed in all analyses (Power, Barnes, Snyder, Schlaggar, & Petersen,  ). Earlier work using slower‐TR fMRI data employed framewise displacement traces to index head movement and identify which data points to censor; however, in faster‐TR data such as the current data set, framewise displacements as originally computed reflect a combination of motion and physiological noise (Byrge & Kennedy,  ; Power et al.,  ; Power et al.,  ). Following Power et al. ( ), we attempted to better isolate head movements by computing filtered framewise displacement traces (FD ) from the backwards differential of the filtered raw head movement traces (using the Butterworth filter reported in the study by Power et al.,  , with a differential of three TRs rather than four, to adjust for the small difference in sampling rates). We censored time points where FD  exceeded three different thresholds: in the primary analyses, a strict threshold of FD  > 0.2 mm, and in supplemental analyses, a more relaxed and inclusive threshold of FD  > 0.5 mm as well as a moderate threshold of FD  > 0.3 mm that permitted randomly downsampling each rest scan prior to FC construction such that no group differences in FD  remained (see  ). In all cases, the remaining (uncensored) TRs were used to construct the FC matrices, and scans with more than 30% of time points censored were excluded from analysis. We generated functional connectivity matrices by computing the Fisher‐z transformed pairwise Pearson correlations among all ROI timeseries. Symmetric 114 × 114 FC matrices were reduced to 6,441 × 1 FC vectors for use in subsequent analyses. \n\n\n#### Group differences in data quality \n  \nReliable group differences in FD  persisted after censoring under the strict and relaxed censoring thresholds (strict [0.2 mm]: for two scans, both rest scans,   U   = 76,   p   = .0028;   U   = 85,   p   = .0125; all other   U   > 95 and   p   > .19); relaxed (0.5 mm); four scans, three rest,   U   < 134,   p   < .0175, all other   U   > 173,   p   > .055). To address these group differences, we included mean FD  as a covariate in analyses where appropriate, and we also repeated the primary analyses upon FC matrices constructed from data randomly downsampled to eliminate group differences in FD  prior to FC construction (for rest data only; see Supporting Information). \n\n\n#### Statistical reporting \n  \nWe report nonparametric statistics throughout this article (except in select cases where parametric approaches are clearly appropriate) due to the relatively small number of individuals in the autism group and to reduce the influence of outliers upon group‐level conclusions. When not explicitly indicated, values reported in parentheses following medians are interquartile ranges. Where relevant, we conservatively report the minimum test statistic (i.e., for Mann–Whitney   U   tests, the smaller of the U statistic for the ranks of the ASD group and for the ranks of the TD group). For group comparisons, positive   z  ‐values reflect higher ranks in the ASD group; for scan‐type comparisons, positive   z  ‐values reflect higher ranks for video scans. There are several methods for reporting effect sizes of nonparametric tests; here we report effect size as   r  , the absolute value of the corresponding z‐statistic divided by the square root of the total sample size. Correlations were Fisher‐z transformed before analysis and inverse‐Fisher‐z transformed for visualization and reporting. Given the absence of reliable group differences, for ease of comparison, all statistics are reported at   α   = .05 without correcting for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n#### Discriminability analyses (fingerprinting) \n  \nWe predicted individual subject identity from functional connectomes in two different ways. In both cases, we kept rest scans and video scans separate, using rest scans to predict identity for rest scans but not using rest scans to predict identity for video scans. First, we used an approach (Byrge & Kennedy,  ) based on the method originally introduced by Finn et al. ( ,  ) and adapted for comparing four scans in one pass (vs. comparing two scans as in the study by Finn et al.,  ,  ). In brief, we first computed the similarity between all pairs of scans as the Pearson correlation between the corresponding pair of FC vectors. Next, we predicted subject identity for a given scan by (a) identifying the scan with maximal similarity to the given scan and (b) taking the subject identity corresponding to the maximally similar scan as the predicted subject identity for the given scan. Accuracy was computed as the percentage of scans for which the predicted subject identity was equal to the actual subject identity. Next, we used the original pairwise fingerprinting approach introduced by Finn et al. ( )—which uses pairs of scans (i.e., rest1 and rest2) to predict identity rather than all four scans of each type but is otherwise the same—then averaged together accuracy for each pair of scans for each subject. \n\n\n#### Consistency and similarity analyses \n  \nThe “fingerprinting” approach compares within‐subject and across‐subject similarity of functional connectomes and succeeds when within‐subject similarity exceeds across‐subject similarity. We also examined these quantities separately. We computed within‐subject similarity—or consistency—as the median of the Fisher‐z transformed Pearson correlations between all pairs of vectorized FC of the same scan type for a given subject. We computed across‐subject similarity analogously, as follows. For each scan, we computed the median of the Fisher‐z transformed Pearson correlations between vectorized FC for that scan and vectorized FC for all scans of the same type from all other subjects in the reference group. We then analyzed these values at the subject level, specifically the median across all scans for the same subject. We computed across‐subject similarity to two reference groups, always using a leave‐one‐subject‐out approach: all (other) TD subjects, and all (other) ASD subjects. As before, rest and video scans were kept separate; that is, rest scans were compared to rest scans but not to video scans. \n\n\n#### Extension of maximal similarity matching (fingerprinting) procedure to diagnosis and scan‐type prediction \n  \nWe extended the fingerprinting or maximal similarity matching procedure for comparing multiple scans in one pass (Byrge & Kennedy,  ) to predict scan type and diagnosis, rather than individual identity. To do this, we took the predicted diagnosis (or scan type) for a given scan as the diagnosis (or scan type) of the scan, it is most similar to. For these analyses, we excluded scans contributed from the same individual; that is, we compared a given scan only to scans from other individuals. \n\n\n#### Connectome‐based predictive modeling \n  \nFollowing Shen et al. ( ), we attempted to predict diagnosis group using functional connectomes. This procedure was conducted separately for rest and for video runs, using leave‐one‐subject‐out cross validation, and using average FC matrices for each subject constructed from the median FC values at each edge across all rest or all video scans. 250 iterations of the following procedure were conducted. First, one subject was left out. Second, a randomly selected subset of TD subjects was selected, to match the size of the remaining ASD group (Spronk et al.,  ). Third, for each FC edge, a GLM was fit, modeling FC in this subset of subjects as a function of diagnosis and mean for each subject of the mean FD  for all scans of this type. We included the latter as a proxy for data quality after noticing that many of the edges that differed between groups also differed between scans with low and high movement; we chose to use means here because they are more susceptible to the extreme values reflecting poorer data quality. Fourth, we masked each functional connectome, selecting only those FC edges that covaried with diagnosis above and beyond any associations with data quality at a threshold of   p   < .01 (note that results did not differ substantially at different thresholds; see Supporting Information). Fifth, we computed two summary values for each included subject: the sum of the FC edges that positively covaried with diagnosis and the sum of the edges that negatively covaried with diagnosis, above and beyond associations with FD . Sixth, we fit a logistic regression modeling diagnosis as a function of two variables, the sums of the positively and the negatively covarying edges (note that including mean FD  as a third variable in this model did not change the pattern of results). Seventh, we computed the sums of the positively and negatively covarying edges for the left‐out‐subject and predicted diagnosis using this last logistic regression model. Finally, after all iterations were completed, we binarized the model predictions using a threshold of 0.5, computed the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for each iteration, and report the medians across iterations. \n\nWe also used the connectome‐based predictive modeling (CPM) procedure to attempt to predict AQ, a continuous scale designed to capture traits associated with the autism spectrum (Baron‐Cohen et al.,  ). The procedure was the same as described above, except the logistic model in Step 6 was replaced with a linear model, and rather than accuracy, we used correlations between actual and predicted AQ to assess model performance. \n\nFinally, we also conducted a parallel CPM procedure in which we attempted to predict scan type rather than diagnosis. For this procedure, the median FC matrix across all rest scans and the median across all video scans for each subject was used as input data, both scans from the left‐out‐subject were excluded from the training sample, and only subjects that had both usable rest and video scans were included. Otherwise, the procedure was identical to that described above. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Functional connectomes are individually discriminable in both TD and ASD groups \n  \nWe began by examining whether functional connectomes were individually discriminable using the “fingerprinting” approach (Finn et al.,  ), which captures whether within‐subject similarity of functional connectivity exceeds across‐subject similarity. We took two different approaches to “fingerprinting”: one that asks whether a given scan is discriminable relative to   any   of the other two to three scans of the same type contributed by that same individual (Byrge & Kennedy,  ), and the other that asks whether a given scan is discriminable relative to   each   of those other two to three scans, evaluated pairwise (Finn et al.,  ). In both cases, we compared like scans (i.e., rest scans to rest scans but not rest scans to video scans). \n\nFunctional connectomes were indeed individually discriminable in both groups. Relative to all available scans of the same type (Byrge & Kennedy,  ), 100% of rest scans and 100% of video scans were discriminable. Across all subjects, average pairwise discriminability (Finn et al.,  ) across all pairs of like scans was also high (for both rest and video scans, Mdn Acc = 100% [0%]; i.e., median = 100% with interquartile range = 0%, see   Statistical Reporting  ). Average pairwise discriminability was reduced in the ASD group for rest scans (Mdn Acc  = 100% [33.3%], Mdn Acc  = 100% [0%],   U   = 109,   z   = −2.77,   p   = .0056,   r   = .44) but did not differ between groups for video scans (Video: Mdn Acc  = 100% [0%], Mdn Acc  = 100% [0%],   U   = 178.5,   z   = −0.36,   p   = .72,   ns  ). \n\nFurther examination revealed that average pairwise discriminability was strongly linked with the number of scans available across all subjects (Rest: Mdn Acc = 66.6% (0%) across individuals with three scans; Mdn 100% (0%) across individuals with four scans;   U   = 3,   z   = −5.06,   p   < .0001,   r   = .81; video: Mdn Acc = 66.6% (0%) for 3 scans; Mdn Acc = 100% (0%) with four scans;   U   = 0,   z   = −5.8,   p   < .0001,   r   = .92). When fewer scans are available for a given individual, the reason is nearly always exclusion due to data quality, making it impossible to decouple whether ASD per se or data quality might underlie the initial group difference in pairwise discriminability for rest scans. Thus, we attempted to further control for potential effects of data quality by regressing mean filtered framewise displacement (FD ) from average pairwise discriminability before assessing potential group differences in the residuals. No reliable group differences in pairwise discriminability remained after this analysis (Rest:   U   = 132, z =   −  1.37,   p   > .17,   ns  ; video:   U   = 147,   z   = 1.12,   p   > .26,   ns  ). \n\nFinally, discriminability did not differ reliably between the different scan tasks (mean pairwise discriminability across all subjects,   W   = 11,   p   > .3,   ns  ) or separately for either group (ASD:   W =   0,   p   > 0.058,   ns  ; TD:   W   = 4,   p   > .7,   ns  ). Thus, the current acquisition and preprocessing choices capture individual distinctness in functional connectivity. \n\n\n### Functional connectomes are consistent in both groups \n  \nAfter establishing that functional connectomes are individually discriminable in both groups, we next decomposed the fingerprinting approach to examine the consistency or within‐subject similarity of functional connectomes. Median within‐subject similarity of functional connectivity did not differ between groups for rest scans (Mdn   r   = .84 [.2], Mdn   r   = .86 [.21],   U   = 152,   z   = −.79,   p   > .42,   ns  ) or for video scans (Mdn   r   = .85 [.16], Mdn   r   = .87 [.18],   W   = 147,   z   = −1.11,   p   > .26,   ns  ). Note that in the larger alternative sample with a more relaxed censoring threshold, there were group differences for rest and marginally so for video scans (rest: Mdn   r   = .82 [.25], Mdn   r   = .26 [.15],   U   = 173,   z   = −2,   p   = .045,   r   = .29; video: Mdn   r   = .84 [.21], Mdn   r   = .87 [.17],   U   = 175,   z   = −1.87,   p   = .061,   r   = .28); however, these were attenuated when mean FD  was first regressed from the data (rest:   U   = 227,   z   = −.83,   p   > .4,   ns  ; video:   U   = 214,   z   = −1,   p   > .3,   ns  ). \n\nConsistency within individuals did not reliably differ between rest and video scans, although it tended to be slightly higher for video scans (Mdn   r   = .87 [.17] vs. Mdn   r   = .86 [.18] for rest scans,   W   = 217,   z   = 1.6,   p   = .11). \n\n\n### Similarity to control functional connectomes did not consistently or robustly differ between groups \n  \nNext, we examined the other component of individual discriminability used by the fingerprinting approach: across‐subject similarity. Of most interest in studies of clinical populations is similarity to control subjects. We computed similarity to (other) control subjects as the median of the correlations between an individuals' functional connectivity matrix and those of all (other) controls for the same scan, averaged separately across rest and across video scans. Similarity to controls was marginally reduced in the ASD group (rest: Mdn   r   = .58 [.04], Mdn   r   = .6 [.05],   U   = 118,   z   = −1.78,   p   = .08,   r   = .28; video: Mdn   r   = .6 [0.07], Mdn   r   = 0.61 [.06],   U   = 125,   z   = −1.73,   p   = .08,   r   = .27). However, once again, regressing mean FD  from the data before comparing the groups resulted in the effect becoming no longer reliable (rest:   U   = 153,   z   = −0.77,   p   = .44,   r   = .12,   ns  ; video:   U   = 140,   z   = −1.31,   p   > .18,   r   = 0.21,   ns  ). As detailed in the Supporting Information (Supplemental Table S , Row 8), this analysis was more sensitive to preprocessing differences than the previous analyses, with marginal group differences persisting in some cases and one small significant effect (uncorrected). However, taken in aggregate across the samples and preprocessing choices analyzed, there were no strong, consistent, robust group differences in this measure. \n\nOverall, subjects were more similar to (other) controls during video scans (  Mdn r   = .6 [.05]) than during rest scans (Mdn   r   = .59 [.05],   W   = 88,   z   = 3.72,   p   < .001,   r   = .42), as might be expected given the constrained nature of the video stimuli. \n\n\n### No shared ASD‐specific FC patterns were evident \n  \nIn parallel to the previous analysis, we also examined across‐subject similarity to the ASD group. Higher similarity among ASD individuals would be suggestive of the shared, ASD‐specific pattern of functional connectivity that is the goal of many clinical functional connectivity studies. However, median similarity to (other) individuals with ASD was not reliably higher in the ASD group (rest: Mdn   r   = .56 [.05], Mdn   r   = 0.58 [.06],   U   = 121,   z   = −1.69,   p =   .09,   r   = .27,   ns  ; video: Mdn   r   = 0.59 [0.047], Mdn   r   = 0.59 [.06],   U   = 134,   z   = −1.48,   p   = .14,   ns  ), and once again, the marginal group difference for the rest scans is eliminated when mean FD  is first regressed from the data (  W   = 155,   z   = −.7,   p   = .48,   r   = .11,   ns  ). As with the previous similarity to TD analysis, this analysis was somewhat sensitive to preprocessing choices (see Supplemental Table S , Row 9), with marginal group differences and one small significant effect (uncorrected) persisting after regressing mean FD  for a few preprocessing approaches. However, regardless of statistical threshold, z‐values were negative across all preprocessing approaches, indicating that the TD group, rather than the ASD group, was the group that demonstrated numerically higher similarity to (other) ASD individuals. This is somewhat counterintuitive, as the opposite pattern would be expected if there were a shared ASD‐specific FC pattern. \n\nTo gain more insight into this pattern of findings, we used multidimensional scaling (MDS) to visualize similarity among pairs of scans, separately for rest (Figure  , top row) and for video scans (Figure  , bottom row). ASD and TD subjects were included together in the MDS computation (Figure  , left column) and also plotted separately for visualization purposes (Figure  , middle column, ASD subjects; right column, TD subjects), with scans from the same subject plotted in the same color. If there were a shared pattern of functional connectivity among all or some ASD subjects, the MDS plots in Figure   (left column) would reveal clusters where ASD scans (in red) are closer together than they are to TD scans (in blue). While there are a few small clusters of ASD data points in the left column, those clusters turn out to reflect individual‐level similarity (c.f. Figure  , top left, upper right and lower right red clusters to those same clusters in Figure  , top middle, see also Figure  , bottom left, rightmost red cluster to that same cluster in Figure  , bottom middle) rather than increased similarity among different individuals with ASD. Overall, the ASD scans that are most dissimilar (those plotted furthest from the center) tend also to be distant from scans from other subjects from both groups (plotted along the periphery), indicating a lack of shared FC pattern. Indeed, for both rest and video scans, MDS visualization intermixes the majority of TD and ASD scans, indicating comparable similarity at this level of analysis. \n  \nMultidimensional scaling (MDS) visualizations of pairwise similarity among all rest scans (top row) and among all video scans (bottom row). Both MDS computations were conducted using all subjects (left column); results are also re‐plotted separately for each group (ASD, middle column; TD, right column) for closer inspection. The middle and right columns plot scans from the same subject in the same color (note that colors are recycled across groups, i.e., the orange points in the middle and in the right plots represent different subjects). Note that these visualizations present pairwise similarity before regressing out FD \n  \nWe note that in general, in both groups, it can be seen in Figure   that scans from the same subject (plotted in the same color) are plotted near to one another, reflecting the high within‐subject similarity reported above, and also more close to one another than to those of other subjects, reflecting the high discriminability or “fingerprinting” accuracy reported above. \n\nThese visualizations also suggest the possibility of a different pattern. Some subjects whose scans have reduced within‐subject similarity—as indicated by greater distance among data points in the same color, such as the green data points in Figure   (top middle)—may also have reduced across‐subject similarity, as indicated by greater distance from the center of the plot. Indeed, for both rest and video scans, there was an increasing relationship between within‐subject similarity and across‐subject similarity, such that subjects whose scans were dissimilar to others also tended to be less consistent relative to themselves. These associations hold across all subjects and separately within both groups and hold using both metrics of across‐subject similarity: similarity to only (other) control subjects (rest: Spearman's   ⍴   = .59,   p   < .001,   ⍴   = .65,   p   = .01,   ⍴   = .54,   p   < .007; video:   ⍴   = .45,   p   < .004,   ⍴   = .58,   p   < .03,   ⍴   = .38,   p   < .06) and similarity to only (other) ASD subjects (rest: Spearman's ⍴  = .55,   p   < .001,   ⍴   = .61,   p   < .02,   ⍴   = .47,   p   < .03; video:   ⍴   = .52,   p   < .001,   ⍴   = .68,   p   < .006,   ⍴   = .45,   p   < .03). In other words, this is a general relationship rather than an ASD‐specific one. This association could reflect a number of underlying mechanisms, but it is suggestive of data quality, and indeed, both within‐subject similarity and similarity to controls are associated with mean FD  across all subjects (rest:   ⍴   = −.42,   p   < .008 and ⍴  = −.4,   p   < .02; video:   ⍴   = −0.57,   p   < .001 and ⍴  = −.4,   p   < 0.02), although this relationship held in the control group (  ⍴   ranging from −0.38 to −0.63;   p   < .0012 to .065) but not the ASD group (  ⍴   ranging from −0.08 to −0.39;   p   > .15 to .75,   ns  ). \n\n\n### Neither rest scans nor video scans permitted differentiating the ASD and TD groups \n  \nThe MDS visualizations, and specifically the interleaving of the majority of scans from ASD and TD subjects, do not suggest that a clear boundary between the groups can be drawn using full functional connectomes as we have done thus far. Indeed, attempts to predict the diagnosis group for all available scans using maximal similarity matching, in parallel to the fingerprinting procedure used previously, result in accuracy around chance, as most scans are predicted to be those of controls (Rest: 62%, 3.6% sensitivity, 95.8% specificity; video: 66.9%, 10.5% sensitivity, 100% specificity). \n\nNonetheless, it remains possible that a more targeted selection of connectome edges might permit better prediction of group membership. Therefore, we conducted connectome‐based predictive modeling (CPM; Shen et al.,  ) separately for rest and video scans, iterating over randomly downsampled subsamples of the control group such that the same number of ASD and TD scans were available. This procedure resulted in group prediction accuracy that was still quite low (Rest: Mdn accuracy 51.3% [7.7%], sensitivity 58.3% [8.3%], specificity 46.7% [20%] across iterations; video: Mdn accuracy 57.5% [7.5%], sensitivity 60% [12%], specificity 60% [13.3%]). CPM accuracy for video scans exceeded rest scans (  U   = 14,171,   z   = −10.6,   p < <   .0001), and this was the case in all but one preprocessing approach examined (see Supplemental Table S ). However, such a difference is difficult to interpret in the context of approximately chance‐level accuracy for both scan tasks. \n\nFinally, in an exploratory follow‐up analysis, we also ran CPM models attempting to predict AQ score, a continuous scale designed to capture traits associated with the autism spectrum (Baron‐Cohen et al.,  ), again separately for rest and for movie scans. Results for rest scans looked similar to the results for diagnostic predictions, with the median correlation between actual AQ scores and predicted AQ scores across iterations being   r   = .035 (IQR = 0.13),   p   = .69 (IQR = 0.36). However, the distribution of correlations was different for movie scans, and positively skewed, with Mdn   r   = .26 (IQR = 0.11), Mdn   p   = .10 (IQR = 0.16), and statistically higher than for rest scans (  U   = 460,   z   = −11.09,   p < <   .001)—despite being predominantly not statistically significant. We consider the differences between these movie and rest results to be an interesting hint deserving follow‐up in future work but not a robust enough result to be considered further in the present work, especially considering the low proportions of variance involved. \n\n\n### Rest and video scans can themselves be near‐perfectly differentiated \n  \nFigure   presents the median FC matrices for each scan task, across all subjects (top row), and across each group (middle rows). Median differences between the groups (bottom row) are small, consistent with the overall indistinguishability of scans from the different groups. Contrary to these small median group differences, Figure   also shows that differences between FC matrices at rest and during the video are evident by eye, across all subjects (top right) and separately within each group (middle right). Indeed, another MDS visualization of pairwise similarity among scans, this time including all scans together rather than examining rest and video scans separately, reveals that while once again ASD and TD scans are intermingled (Figure  , left), rest and video scans form visually distinct groups (Figure  , right). \n  \nMedian and difference functional connectivity matrices for each scan task across all subjects (Row 1), for each diagnosis group (Rows 2 and 3), and differences between diagnosis groups for each task (Row 4). Task differences (Column 3) are more apparent upon visual inspection than group differences (Row 4). Differences are ordered as ASD‐TD (Row 4) and Video‐Rest (Column 3). Left hemisphere ROIs are plotted to the left and above right hemisphere ROIs \n    \nMDS visualizations of pairwise similarity among all scans. Left: scans color‐coded according to diagnosis (red = ASD, blue = TD). Right: scans color‐coded according to scan type (green = video; black = rest). Note that these visualizations present pairwise similarity before regressing out FD \n  \nThese results suggest that it may be possible to predict scan type based on functional connectivity, using the same analytic techniques that did not differentiate groups. Using maximal similarity matching (parallel to fingerprinting), scan‐type prediction accuracy was 98.4% across all scans, with comparable accuracy using CPM upon both median rest and median video connectomes together (Mdn accuracy = 98.6% (0%) across iterations). Taken all together, scan task and individual identity were stronger drivers of similarity and dissimilarity among scans than diagnosis group membership. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nWe found no consistent or robust differences in functional connectomes between the ASD group and the TD group, despite a densely sampled, high‐resolution acquisition that allowed us to predict individual identity and scan task with near‐perfect accuracy. Functional connectomes from individuals with ASD were equally discriminable as those of controls, and equally consistent across different scans. Although a few specific preprocessing choices gave rise to small effects of reduced similarity to controls in the ASD group, the overarching conclusion from these analyses is that ASD functional connectomes in this data set were consistently indistinguishable from those of controls (see also Byrge, Dubois, Tyszka, Adolphs, & Kennedy,  ; Dajani et al.,  ). Collecting more data per individual and including naturalistic viewing conditions were thus not sufficient to robustly pull apart the diagnosis groups, and whatever shared ASD‐specific signals may ultimately exist in this sample must thus be smaller than those associated with scan task and individual identity. \n\nThe success observed in discriminating individual functional connectomes is in line with the existing literature (Finn et al.,  ; Finn et al.,  ; Horien et al.,  ; Vanderwal et al.,  ) and the effectively perfect accuracy in our densely sampled dataset is consistent with work showing that increasing temporal sampling improves discriminability and reliability of FC (Birn et al.,  ; Horien et al.,  ; Laumann et al.,  ). Ours is the first study, to our knowledge, to evaluate functional connectome fingerprinting in ASD and we found that given our acquisition parameters, preprocessing choices, and sample, discriminability of functional connectomes in ASD did not differ from those of controls so long as data quality was controlled in analyses. The high accuracy obtained from using functional connectomes to predict scan task is consistent with prior work demonstrating successful prediction of task from connectivity measures (Kaufmann et al.,  ; Pallares et al.,  ; Richiardi, Eryilmaz, Schwartz, Vuilleumier, & Van De Ville,  ; Xie et al.,  ). What is most striking, at least superficially, is that a recognizable diagnosis defined by shared clinical features across individuals was not associated with a shared pattern of brain function, in this data set, using these analytic approaches. \n\nWhether common patterns of brain function associated with ASD do ultimately exist in this dataset and in this particular sample of individuals is not something that can be conclusively answered at this time. Several possibilities exist. One is that shared patterns of brain function associated with ASD do exist. Given that an ASD diagnosis is associated with common behavior patterns, and behavior comes from the brain, this possibility is likely to be what most people would expect. In that case, either such shared neurofunctional differences occur at a different temporal or spatial scale than the current fMRI acquisition can measure, and thus detecting them requires technological advances, or perhaps instead such shared differences do exist at the current resolution and detecting them requires instead analytic or denoising advancements. Another possibility recognizes that shared patterns of behavior need not be associated with shared patterns of brain function (Edelman & Gally,  ; Price & Friston,  ; Seghier & Price,  ). Although this principle applies broadly (e.g., to reading, in adult controls; Richardson, Seghier, Leff, Thomas, & Price,  ), in ASD research, it is typically considered under the umbrella of “heterogeneity”—the idea that because ASD is thought to be associated with multiple distinct etiologies and developmental histories (Fountain, Winter, & Bearman,  ; Geschwind,  ; Landa, Gross, Stuart, & Bauman,  ; Levy, Mandell, & Schultz,  ), the search for shared patterns of brain function associated with ASD may be more fruitful within ASD subgroups that reflect shared etiological and developmental factors (e.g., Lombardo et al.,  ). Detecting shared patterns of brain function associated with ASD subgroups requires a larger sample size and more extensive phenotyping and/or genotyping than the current dataset. However, at least at the level of full cortical functional connectomes, our analyses revealed no hints of distinct shared patterns among a subset of ASD individuals: similarity to (other) ASD individuals was never higher in the ASD group, and visual inspection of the MDS plots suggested no clusters comprised of more than one individual with ASD. \n\nOur results reveal that across diagnosis groups, and consistent with the literature in controls (Byrge & Kennedy,  ; Finn et al.,  ; Finn et al.,  ; Horien et al.,  ; Vanderwal et al.,  ), individuals are more similar to themselves across scans than to others, an observation that the fingerprinting approach leverages for predicting identity. Visual inspection of the MDS plots (Figure  ) also reveals that scans from select individuals with ASD seem to form their own cluster, away from the other scans. Whether such examples reflect the individual variability seen across all subjects—perhaps in a more exaggerated form—or instead perhaps a member of a real ASD subgroup that happens to be represented by   N =   1 in our particular sample (e.g., perhaps one specific, rare, etiology)—cannot be determined without a larger sample. This is also related to discussions of “idiosyncrasy” in ASD—although definitions vary, numerous studies have observed a form of exaggerated individual variability, in which some individuals with ASD appear both distinct from controls and distinct from other individuals with ASD (Byrge et al.,  ; Hahamy, Behrmann, & Malach,  ; Hasson et al.,  ; Nunes, Peatfield, Vakorin, & Doesburg,  ). This pattern is also observed in some individuals with ASD in this sample, although associations between within‐subject similarity, across‐subject similarity, and data quality across all subjects make these dimensions difficult to disentangle. \n\nIt is worth noting that residual associations between our measures of interest and indices of data quality persisted in our sample despite our rigorous data inclusion thresholds and state‐of‐the‐art preprocessing approaches. While it has long been known that effects of head motion persist longer than the motion itself (Power et al.,  ), the existing literature would suggest that such residual motion effects should be mitigated by our use of global signal regression (Byrge & Kennedy,  ; Power et al.,  ; Power, Schlaggar, & Petersen,  ). A priori, the residual associations with FD  that we observed could reflect effects of data   quantity—  higher FD  corresponds with more censoring and thus fewer data points included, potentially leading to less precise FC estimates and reduced similarity to others. However, this association persisted in the downsampled supplemental preprocessing approach (Supplemental Table S , Column 4), in which data quantity is equated across all individuals. We also cannot rule out the possibility that what we are calling residual associations with motion might be due to some other individual difference, potentially ASD related, that also happens to covary with FD . It is certainly plausible, for instance, that more severely affected members of a clinical group may also move more in the scanner. However, the associations between FD  and within‐ and across‐subject similarity in the control group seem to undermine this possibility while not ruling it out. It is also worth recognizing that our understanding of how nuisance factors influence the fMRI signal and fcMRI measures is incomplete and continually evolving. Our indices of data quality are far from perfect; while framewise displacement is a good proxy for data quality, it is not the only measure that is informative (Byrge & Kennedy,  ; Power et al.,  ,  ,  ). Regardless of the underlying causes, these associations point to the need to carefully examine potential residual effects of data quality even after following best practices. \n\nOne initial hypothesis was that adding a video stimulus with social content to the commonly used resting state fcMRI paradigms might improve detection of ASD‐specific patterns of brain function, because processing social content may be more related to the behavioral domains in which ASD symptoms are observed, and because driving the brain with a common stimulus might better permit detection of individual and group differences that the unconstrained resting state might obscure. We found instead that patterns of results were generally comparable between rest and video scans. We did find that prediction accuracy was reliably higher using video scans, but in the context of overall very low accuracy for both scan types, it is not prudent to interpret this further. Whether video scans provide a benefit to diagnosis group prediction in a sample where resting state scans achieve above‐chance accuracy remains an open question. Contrary to other work showing improvements in discriminability and reliability during video watching in the scanner (Vanderwal et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ), we found no differences in those measures in the current study. We speculate that this may be due to the temporal sampling in the current data set and ceiling‐level discriminability, and that such an advantage for video watching could potentially still be observable across shorter FC epochs such as in a dynamic FC paradigm. These are important questions for future study. \n\nLimitations of this study predominantly include the relatively small sample size and limited phenotyping, which, as noted previously, prevent us from addressing pressing questions about heterogeneity in ASD. Due to our relatively small sample size and interest in group‐level effects, we used nonparametric statistical tests for their reduced susceptibility to outliers. While the pattern of results did not materially change under parametric tests, it is possible that the conservative tests we used under‐emphasized real small effects in our data that could become more robust in a larger sample. It is important to make clear that while we do not have strong evidence for ASD‐specific differences, we also do not have strong evidence for a lack of differences. We note that we the current study included a relatively large age range and unbalanced ratio of males and females; we balanced age and sex between our groups in an attempt to best mitigate any effects of these variables on our results. However, complex interactions between age, sex, and diagnosis, together with a whole host of other variables, could still be present, and our sample size is underpowered to detect these interactions. Future studies might examine similar questions within a more narrow age range or separately within males or females. Finally, we used video stimuli with social content to drive brains in a coordinated manner, in a way potentially more related to ASD symptomology than the resting state. However, it is possible that scanning individuals in a manner even more closely approaching the behavioral domains of ASD—such as during more complex and subtle social interactions (as in, e.g., Byrge et al.,  ) than the movie trailers included here, or even during actual social interactions (Redcay et al.,  ,  )—may serve to better differentiate the groups. Finally, there are of course existing analytic approaches we have not yet applied to this data set and that could be promising directions for differentiating diagnosis groups, including time‐varying functional connectivity (see, e.g., Falahpour et al.,  ; Mash et al.,  ) and inter‐subject functional correlation (Simony et al.,  ) approaches. Future work will explore these directions. \n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nIt was not possible to predict ASD diagnosis much above chance in a high quality and extensively sampled data set including rest and video scans; a data set that permitted predicting individual identity and scan type with effectively perfect accuracy. We found no conclusively ASD‐associated effects for which data quality was not also implicated. Individuals from both groups contributed high quality, discriminable, consistent data, and the overarching picture was that scans from the ASD group were indistinguishable from the control group. Inconsistent and null results in the ASD fcMRI literature cannot be solely attributed to insufficiently sampled scans and limited scan tasks. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTERESTS \n  \nThe authors declare no competing financial interests. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nBoth authors developed the study concept, L.B. analyzed the data with input from D.P.K., L.B. drafted the initial version of the manuscript, and both authors revised the manuscript critically and approved the final version.

Altered functional connectivity has been associated with ADHD symptoms. This study aimed to investigate abnormal changes in the functional connectivity of resting-state brain networks (RSNs) among adolescent patients with different subtypes of ADHD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe data were obtained from the ADHD-200 Global Competition, including fMRI data from 88 ADHD patients (56 patients of ADHD-Combined, ADHD-C and 32 patients of ADHD-Inattentive, ADHD-I) and 67 typically developing controls (TD-C). Group ICA was utilized to research aberrant brain functional connectivity within the different subtypes of ADHD. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn comparison with the TD-C group, the ADHD-C group showed clusters of decreased functional connectivity in the left inferior occipital gyrus (p = 0.0041) and right superior occipital gyrus (p = 0.0011) of the dorsal attention network (DAN), supplementary motor area (p = 0.0036) of the executive control network (ECN), left supramarginal gyrus (p = 0.0081) of the salience network (SN), middle temporal gyrus (p = 0.0041), and superior medial frontal gyrus (p = 0.0055) of the default mode network (DMN), while the ADHD-I group showed decreased functional connectivity in the right superior parietal gyrus (p = 0.0017) of the DAN and left middle temporal gyrus (p = 0.0105) of the DMN. In comparison with the ADHD-I group, the ADHD-C group showed decreased functional connectivity in the superior temporal gyrus (p = 0.0062) of the AN, inferior temporal gyrus (p = 0.0016) of the DAN, and the dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus (p = 0.0082) of the DMN. All the clusters surviving at p < 0.05 (AlphaSim correction). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe results suggested that decreased functional connectivity within the DMN and DAN was responsible, at least in part, for the symptom of inattention in ADHD-I patients. Similarly, we believed that the impaired functional connectivity within networks may contribute to the manifestations of ADHD-C patients, including inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and unconscious movements. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has emerged as a common contributor to neuro developmental disorders as well as frequent psychological and behavioral problems among children [ ]. The global prevalence of ADHD is about 5.29%. According to the previous studies, any variation in the prevalence estimates can be attributed to the methodological characteristics of different studies instead of discrepancies in the actual distribution of ADHD [ ]. There are a great number of adolescent ADHD patients in the world; thus, management and treatment of ADHD patients is very important. ADHD is mainly characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Diagnosis of ADHD is mainly depended on the levels of symptoms listed in DSM-IV [ ] and is usually conducted by parents or teachers, which is subjective. Typically, ADHD can be categorized into three subtypes: hyperactive-impulsivity (ADHD-HI), persistent inattention (ADHD-I), and a combination of both (ADHD-C) [ ,  ]. This disorder is often accompanied by learning difficulties or conduct disorders [ ,  ], which can greatly affect the interpersonal skills and academic performance of the patients. Many studies have pointed out that the subjective diagnoses make it difficult to draw a line between the normal level and the level of ADHD symptoms that need treatment [ ]. Thus, studies on objective diagnosis of ADHD are of great significance, and research on ADHD has become a major topic of interest in medicine and psychology in recent years. \n\nIn previous studies, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was widely used to examine the brain of ADHD patients [ ,  ]. In rs-fMRI studies of brain function, abnormalities were found in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, putamen, temporal cortex, and cerebellum [ ,  ]. rs-fMRI has become a research hotspot that is being increasingly used to achieve obvious results in many fields, such as neuroscience, spiritual science, biological science, and statistics, and it has been shown to be helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD [ ,  ]. A growing body of literature shows that communication abnormalities among and within neural networks may underlie ADHD [ ]. rs-fMRI can effectively identify such network abnormalities, and it is unconstrained by limitations yet reliable for this purpose. In rs-fMRI experiments, subjects are awake and are asked to simply rest while lying in the MRI scanner, so brain activity can be considered “spontaneous” rather than stimulus- or task-driven. As previously mentioned, most researchers focused on the default mode network (DMN), while less attention was paid to other brain networks or differences between the two types of ADHD. Therefore, we speculated that the auditory network (AN), dorsal attention network (DAN), executive control network (ECN), salience network (SN), and sensorimotor network (SMN) are also related to ADHD, and we compared the differences in the functional connectivity (FC) of six resting-state brain networks (RSNs) between two ADHD subtypes. \n\nIn the present study, group independent component analysis (ICA), a data-driven approach, was adopted to extract the components [ ]. ICA is a widely used method for statistical analysis of fMRI data [ ,  ]. Without any prior information, this method can effectively determine the functional characteristics of mutually correlated brain components [ ]. We hope to identify the differences in these RSNs among patients with different subtypes of ADHD by comparing the FCs of the six RSNs among the three groups. We speculate that the symptoms of ADHD patients are related to abnormal FCs of these RSNs. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nPublic fMRI data were downloaded from the ADHD-200 Global Competition ( ) and selected exclusively from the New York University (NYU) Child Study Center. In accordance with HIPAA guidelines and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project protocols, all datasets are anonymous, with no protected health information included. For both ADHD and TD subjects, the inclusion criteria were as follows: age of 7–17 years, no history of neurological disease, and no diagnosis of either schizophrenia or affective disorder, an image covering at least 95% of the brain, an IQ score > 80, and head movement less than 2.0. Subjects were enrolled if they were right-handed and their information was complete (e.g., age, Verbal IQ, or Performance IQ). Finally, fMRI data from a total of 155 volunteers aged between 7 and 17 years were collected, including 67 typically developing controls (TD-C), 56 ADHD-C patients, and 32 ADHD-I patients (the number of ADHD-HI patients was too small to be studied). IBM SPSS software (Armonk, NY, v. 22.0) was used for statistical analysis. One-way analysis of variance was performed with age, ADHD index, verbal IQ, performance IQ, and Full IQ, and the Chi squared test was used to evaluate the differences in gender among the three groups. A   p   value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, as shown in Table  . The symptoms of ADHD were assessed using the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised, Long version (CPRS-LV) [ ].   \nDemographic characteristics of the samples \n  \nThe data (except Gender) were shown in mean ± standard deviation, the Gender was shown in total (number of females) \n\n AC   ADHD-Combined patients,   AI   ADHD-Inattentive patients,   IQ   Intelligence Quotient,   NA   not applicabl,   TD-C   Typically-Developing Controls \n\none-way analysis of variance \n\nChi square test \n  \n\nThe fMRI data were acquired using a single-shot echo-planar imaging (GRE-EPI) sequence with the following imaging parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms; echo time (TE) = 15 ms; flip angle (FA) = 90°; FOV reading = 240 mm; slice thickness = 4 mm; number of slices = 33; and voxel size = 3 × 3 × 4 mm , time points = 176, and acquisition matrix = 80 × 80. \n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nThe original fMRI data were preprocessed using a public toolbox named DPABI (for Data Processing & Analysis of Brain Imaging,  ). The preprocessing steps were as follows: (1) remove the first 10 volumes to ensure that the BOLD signal was stable; (2) slice timing, correct the difference due to acquisition times between slices in the volume; (3) head motion correction; (4) normalization, register the data to the EPI standard template and resample it to 3.0 × 3.0 × 3.0 mm ; and (5) spatial smoothing with a 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel [ ]. Subjects whose head movement exceeded 2.0 mm were excluded. \n\n\n### ICA and determination of RSNs \n  \nWe employed the ICA, a data-driven analysis technique [ ], to identify the RSNs of the ADHD patients and TD-C. The ICA approach had been applied to simulation data by the research group of Dr. Calhoun [ ,  ,  ]. In our study, a group ICA analysis was conducted to decompose the data into ICs using GIFT toolbox (Version 4.0,  ) for all subjects, including ADHD patients and TD-C. This toolbox implements estimation of the independent components (ICs) on concatenated data of subject-specific spatial maps and time courses across subjects [ ]. First, The principal component analysis was used to reduce the data dimensionality. We used the minimum description length (MDL) criteria to define the number of ICs, indicating 20 ICs for our functional dataset, which is sufficient to capture the most frequently observed large-scale resting-state networks [ ]. The infomax algorithm that was repeated 20 times in ICASSO, was then used as an independent component estimation. The resulting components were clustered to estimate the reliability of the decomposition. Finally, the individual time courses and spatial maps were reconstructed using the group ICA back-reconstruction method. \n\nThe RSN components were subsequently selected via an automated process that defines the components that most closely matched the RSNs for each individual subject, based on spatial correlation analyses with the RSNs templates. All templates represent regions that have repeatedly been implicated in the RSNs. \n\nThere were six RSNs of interest, namely, the AN, DAN, DMN, ECN, SN, and SMN. All RSN templates were created with WFU_PickAtlas ( ) in the SPM toolbox based on centroid coordinates and radii. The component with the largest correlation coefficient was selected as the RSN we were interested in. A total of six components were identified. Figure   shows the templates of the six RSNs and the selected corresponding ICs that had the highest spatial correlation with the template. In order to verify whether the six ICs of each group were zero, a one-sample t-test was performed and according to the settings in the previous study [ ], we set a threshold of p < 0.05, as shown in Fig.  .   \nThe results of spatial correlation for ICs and templates.

The Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit plus V1.2 (RESTplus V1.2,  ) was the toolbox of our choice for statistical analysis. In order to verify whether the six ICs differed among the three groups, analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ICs (AlphaSim correction, p < 0.05) was performed with the result of the one-sample t-test serving as an explicit mask, where age and gender were controlled as covariates. The differences between the groups of ICs were obtained by two-sample t-test (AlphaSim correction, p < 0.05, cluster > 10) with the result of ANOVA serving as an explicit mask. Similarly, age and gender were eliminated as covariates. Finally, a Spearman correlation analysis was performed between the ADHD index and mean signals of ICs that we delineated as ROIs. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ANOVA showed differences between the three groups \n  \nThe ANOVA results for all ICs are shown in Fig.   and Table  , indicating the brain regions where there may be differences between the six ICs in the three groups of subjects. The regions depicted in red-yellow shown in Fig.   indicate differences in RSNs between the three groups. The F values and p values of the most significant differences in each RSN are shown in Table  . As shown in Fig.  , brain regions with significant differences appeared in the superior temporal gyrus of the AN, superior parietal gyrus and occipital lobe of the DAN, middle temporal gyrus and superior medial frontal gyrus of the DMN, supplementary motor area of the ECN, precentral gyrus of the SMN, as well as supramarginal gyrus of the SN.   \nThe results of ANOVA.

In contrast, stronger FC was observed within three RSNs, including the supramarginal gyrus (p = 0.0027) of AN, the precentral gyrus (p = 0.0024) of SMN, and the medial frontal gyrus (p = 0.0265) of DMN.   \nThe differences between ADHD-I patients and healthy controls.

However, an increase in the FC was found in the middle temporal gyrus (p = 0.0051) of DMN, as illustrated in Fig.  .   \nThe difference between ADHD-C patients and ADHD-I patients.

And the enhanced functional connectivity in DMN (left) is depicted in red \n  \n\n\n\n### Correlation analysis \n  \nThe above results have demonstrated a significant area of FC abnormalities in RSNs in ADHD patients. A Spearman correlation analysis was performed between ADHD index and the mean signals of ICs that we delineated as ROIs, in order to verify whether the ADHD indices of the two groups of ADHD patients were associated with FC abnormalities. All correlation analyses were performed in the ADHD-C and ADHD-I groups. An inverse relationship with the ADHD index was only found for the left supplementary motor area of ECN in the ADHD-C group (r = − 0.267, p = 0.047). The results showed no significant difference (p > 0.05) after a multiple comparison correction. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, group ICA was performed and both subtypes of ADHD patients showed impaired FCs in major RSNs in comparison with TD-C. We found that the FCs of the DAN, ECN, SN, and DMN were significantly reduced in ADHD-C patients, including the right inferior occipital gyrus and the superior occipital gyrus of DAN, supplementary motor area of ECN, left supramarginal gyrus of SN, and middle temporal gyrus and superior medial frontal gyrus of DMN. \n\nMany previous studies have demonstrated abnormal functional connections within the DMN of ADHD patients, especially the temporal lobe [ ,  ,  ]. DMN is a commonly used brain network in fMRI studies and is considered to be associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases [ ]. In our study, in comparison with the TD-C group, both subtypes of ADHD patients showed reduced FC in the occipital lobe of DAN and the middle temporal gyrus of DMN. However, in the superior medial frontal gyrus of DMN, the two groups performed inversely. Although DMN and DAN activity were believed to show opposite trends [ ,  ], Matthew L. Dixon demonstrated that there is no anticorrelation between some subsystems and DMN [ ]. These could explain our findings that reduced FC occurred simultaneously in DAN and DMN. We also observed differences in FCs between the two groups of ADHD subtypes. Patients with ADHD-C showed more reduced FC, such as the inferior temporal gyrus of DAN and superior frontal gyrus of DMN. Only a portion of the middle temporal gyrus of DMN has shown an enhanced FC. One explanation for the difference may be the diverse clinical symptoms between the two subtypes of ADHD patients. DMN shows greater activation during periods of silence or in a resting state [ ]. In contrast, DAN is routinely activated during attention-demanding cognitive tasks [ ]. Thus, we speculated that abnormal changes in FC exhibited by DMN and DAN may be related to the attention deficit in ADHD patients, which has been proven by some previous studies [ ,  ]. \n\nWhen comparing the ADHD-I to the TD-C group, we found a few regions showing enhanced FC, such as the supramarginal gyrus of AN and the precentral gyrus of SMN. Previous studies have shown that patients with ADHD were more sensitive to sound, which may be related to the enhanced FC in AN [ ]. Jean-Arthur reported that ADHD patients had perceptual inundation [ ]. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on the changes in AN and SMN, and few voxels in these regions were found in our study, which may be due to differences in sample size. Thus, we have not provided additional discussions about these regions. \n\nDaniel von Rhein revealed that SN plays a role in supervision and decision when the brain processes external stimuli [ ]. The main functions of the SN are to integrate information from different modalities such as sensory information and bodily states in order to establish goal-directed behavior and to process emotion-related information. Our findings showing reduced FC of the SN in ADHD-C patients confirmed the conclusions proposed by Daniel von Rhein [ ]. In addition, the ECN has been shown to participate in multiple advanced cognitive tasks and play an important role in adaptive cognitive control [ ]. The decreased FC in ECN may explain why ADHD-C patients fail to control their emotions and exhibit impulsive aggression or other conduct disorders [ ,  ]. Two subtypes of ADHD patients also differ in FC of ECN. In the ADHD-C group, the superior frontal gyrus of ECN showed weaker FC. We speculate that this change may explain why ADHD-C patients are more hyperactive than ADHD-I patients. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, group ICA allowed the use of interrelated analytical methods for evaluating FCs of ADHD in adolescents in this study. We found that these major RSNs in both subtypes of ADHD patients showed FC changes in comparison with the TD-C group, and FC differences were also observed between the two subtypes of ADHD patients. Our study elucidates the abnormal changes in the RSNs of different subtypes of adolescent ADHD patients, which may prove helpful for the management of adolescent ADHD patients. In the future, studies employing a multimodal imaging approach using techniques such as structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging and fMRI, will be necessary to comprehensively investigate the brain changes in adolescents with ADHD. These further studies will contribute to the management and treatment of ADHD in adolescents. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nOne of the limitations of our study was the absence of any psychological assessment of the cognitive parameters associated with ADHD. Moreover, the participant numbers in the three groups were substantially different, which was likely to have an impact on the results of statistical analysis.

The differences between our templates and the actual anatomical RSNs would have also affected the accuracy of our results. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"1d4cf1035055be025f658eb11eba2de3"},

Default Mode Network (DMN) areas have been recently demonstrated as selectively involved in sCJD, and functional connectivity has never been investigated in prion diseases. We analyzed the grey matter involvement using a quantitatively multi‐parametric MRI approach. Specifically, grey matter mean diffusivity of 37 subjects with sCJD was compared with that of 30 age‐matched healthy controls with a group‐wise approach. Differences in mean diffusivity were also examined between the cortical (MM(V)1, MM(V)2C, and VV1) and subcortical (VV2 and MV2K) subgroups of sCJD for those with autopsy data available (  n   = 27, 73%). We also assessed resting‐state functional connectivity of both ventral and dorsal components of DMN in a subset of subject with a rs‐fMRI dataset available (  n   = 17). Decreased diffusivity was predominantly present in posterior cortical regions of the DMN, but also outside of the DMN in temporal areas and in a few limbic and frontal areas, in addition to extensive deep nuclei involvement. Both subcortical and cortical sCJD subgroups showed decreased diffusivity subcortically, whereas only the cortical type expressed significantly decreased diffusivity cortically, mainly in parietal, occipital, and medial‐inferior temporal cortices bilaterally. Interestingly, we found abnormally increased connectivity in both dorsal and ventral components of the DMN in sCJD subjects compared with healthy controls. The significance and possible utility of functional imaging as a biomarker for tracking disease progression in prion disease needs to be explored further. \n  \nIn our study we explored quantitatively the diffusivity of grey matter and resting‐state functional connectivity in a cohort of sporadic Creutzfeldt‐Jakob subjects and found an involvement of areas included in the Default Mode Network.

The disease is typically characterized by rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia, and myoclonus progressing to death usually within a year or less from onset (Brown et al.,  ), but presentations can be quite heterogeneous (Collins et al.,  ; Geschwind,  ; Parchi et al.,  ). Diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) brain MRI shows a pattern of decreased diffusivity with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and has consequently been included in updated sCJD diagnostic criteria (Bizzi et al.,  ; Geschwind et al.,  ; Staffaroni et al.,  ; Vitali et al.,  ; WHO,  ; Zerr et al.,  ). \n\nMost imaging studies in sCJD have evaluated signal abnormalities on fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and especially DWI by visual assessment (Eisenmenger et al.,  ; Kallenberg et al.,  ; Meissner et al.,  ; Shiga et al.,  ; Tschampa et al.,  ; Vitali et al.,  ; Young et al.,  ; Zerr et al.,  ). These diffusivity changes in sCJD have been associated mainly with vacuolation (Figini et al.,  ; Geschwind et al.,  ; Manners et al.,  ). \n\nQualitative visual assessment of reduced diffusivity on DWI images is very helpful for sCJD diagnosis (Hermann et al.,  ;  Zerr et al.,  ), but has several shortcomings due to the subjectivity of readings and difficulty distinguishing true abnormalities from artifact, and therefore may increase the risk of under‐ or overestimating the real extent of disease involvement (Caverzasi, Henry, et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). To overcome such limitations, quantitative approaches have been used to more precisely assess diffusivity metrics, especially mean diffusivity (MD), in prion diseases (Caverzasi, Henry, et al.,  ; Caverzasi, Mandelli, et al.,  ; Eisenmenger et al.,  ; Grau‐Rivera et al.,  ; Manners et al.,  ; Ukisu et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). A quantitative approach, in fact, may be more precise at determining involved regions and investigating the heterogeneity of radiological patterns of abnormalities (Grau‐Rivera et al.,  ;  Sacco et al.,  ). \n\nVisual and quantitative assessments of diffusivity abnormalities in sCJD, although heterogeneous, generally show prominent involvement of the anterior cingulate, parieto‐angular, retrosplenial, and middle temporal cortices (Caverzasi, Henry, et al.,  ; Vitali et al.,  ) areas that are part of the Default Mode Network (DMN) (Alves et al.,  ; Buckner et al.,  ; Leech & Sharp,  ). In a recent voxel‐based morphometry study, we found selective atrophy in almost all regions part of DMN, further suggesting that DMN network could be a preferential site of involvement in prion disease (Younes et al.,  ). \n\nTo our knowledge, functional connectivity has not been investigated in prion disease, yet analysis of resting‐state functional MRI (rs‐fMRI) can have a role in identifying dysfunction before structural and possibly even diffusivity abnormalities may be identified. In non‐prion neurodegenerative diseases, a correlation between the pattern of involvement (usually by atrophy) and dysfunction of intrinsic connectivity networks is often seen (Gardner et al.,  ; Seeley et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ), and functional measures have also been shown to be sensitive to disease involvement even in regions without suspected or measured atrophy (Dopper et al.,  ; Hacker et al.,  ; Nestor et al.,  ). \n\nIn the present work, we aimed (a) to assess quantitatively the diffusivity abnormalities in sCJD grey matter to demonstrate preferential involvement of the DMN‐related areas; (b) to investigate if patterns of involvement specific for sCJD molecular subtypes might be detected by quantitative analysis; and (c) to investigate any resting‐state functional abnormality within the DMN in sCJD. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nFrom June 2008 to September 2015, 64 subjects with rapidly progressive dementia ultimately diagnosed by us with probable and/or definite sCJD had a research visit at our center at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center (MAC). All met UCSF 2007 probable or definite sporadic CJD criteria (Geschwind et al.,  ; Kretzschmar et al.,  ; Parchi et al.,  ) (many also eventually met either WHO 1998 or European probable sCJD criteria (WHO,  ; Zerr et al.,  )). 58 subjects had a 3T MRI (Siemens Trio Syngo), but only 49 had the same high angular resolution diffusion‐weighted imaging (HARDI) acquisition for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis. Twelve subject‘s scans were excluded because of poor quality images due to severe motion artifact. Thus, 37 subjects were included in the diffusion dataset of this study (mean age 64 ± 7.8, 17 females). The same sCJD cohort has been recently presented in another paper from our group (Sacco et al.,  ). A rs‐fMRI acquisition was added to the protocol in mid—2011 and acquired in a subgroup of subjects (  n   = 19). Of those nineteen, two were excluded for head motion, based on a threshold of >3 mm translational movement or >3° relative rotation or number of motion spikes >10% of the total (relative motion >1 mm), leaving 17 subjects used in the functional analysis. \n\nGenotyping for pathogenic prion protein gene   (PRNP)   mutations and codon 129 polymorphisms were performed through the U.S. National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC; Cleveland, OH).   PRNP   genotype and codon 129 polymorphism data were available in all 37 subjects; none had mutations. Twenty‐seven subjects (73%) were pathologically proven, all of whom had prion typing (Kretzschmar et al.,  ; Parchi et al.,  ). \n\nA detailed standardized neurological examination and testing, including Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) and modified Barthel index (Mahoney & Barthel,  ), were recorded ± 3 days from MRI date. \n\nThirty healthy age and sex‐matched subjects who underwent the same MRI protocol on the same scanner were selected from the MAC database (mean age 63.4 ± 10.5 SD, 15 females) as controls. Participants or their caregivers provided informed consent to the present study, which was approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research. \n\n\n###  MRI   acquisition \n  \nThe HARDI dataset was acquired using a single‐shot spin‐echo echo‐planar imaging (EPI) sequence including 55 contiguous axial slices acquired in an interleaved order (TR/TE = 8000/109 ms; flip angle = 90°; matrix = 100 × 100; in‐plane resolution = 2.2 mm ; slice thickness = 2.2 mm; 64 noncollinear diffusion sensitization directions at   b   = 2000 s/mm , 1 at   b   = 0; integrated parallel acquisition technique acceleration (IPAT) factor = 2). \n\nFor functional imaging, 36 interleaved axial slices (slice thickness = 3 mm with 0.6 mm gap) were acquired using a  ‐weighted EPI sequence (TR/TE = 2000/27 ms, flip angle = 80°; field of view = 230 × 230 mm ; matrix = 92 × 92; in‐plane resolution = 2.5 × 2.5 mm; 240 volumes) with an online gradient adjustment for head motion compensation. Participants were instructed to lie still with their eyes closed, and to remain awake, thinking of nothing. \n\nA T1‐weighted (T1w) sequence was acquired for all subjects for structural reference and for purpose of registration. \n\n\n### Image processing and analysis \n  \n#### Diffusion imaging \n  \n##### Preprocessing \n  \nInitial image preprocessing was performed using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL;  ). FSL's brain extraction tool was used for skull stripping. Preprocessing of HARDI datasets was performed using FSL's diffusion toolbox. Eddy current distortions and motion artifacts were corrected by registering each diffusion‐sensitized volume to the   b  0 volume with an affine transform. After tensor diagonalization, whole‐brain maps of voxel‐wise quantitative DTI metrics were obtained, most importantly for this paper, MD. For each subject, the   b  0 volume of the DWI dataset was registered to T1w image through dedicated boundary‐based registration (BBR) (Greve & Fischl,  ). The T1w image was registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard atlas using FSL's linear and nonlinear registration tool. MD maps were warped to MNI space using the transform estimated for the registration of T1w image to MNI space. \n\n\n##### Group‐wise analysis \n  \nFor both subjects and controls, the average MD was determined for each brain GM region (cortical, subcortical and cerebellum) and for each of 41 GM volume‐of‐interest (VOI) per hemisphere (Desikan et al.,  ; Fischl et al.,  ). To decrease the potential effect of partial volume artifact, a threshold intensity (average intensity of CSF extracted in ventricles—2 SD, [0.0016–0.00023]) was used to exclude voxels that were likely to contain a mixture of CSF with GM from the VOI boundary. We considered caudate, putamen, globus pallidus (GP), and thalami as subcortical VOIs. For all analyses, FDR correction for multiple comparisons was applied: significance was set at   p   < .05 FDR corrected. As post hoc analysis, we also built single‐subject MD‐based involvement maps on the MNI space to explore the feasibility of such an approach and to corroborate the group‐wise analysis (see  ). \n\n\n##### Sub‐group analysis by cortical or subcortical major involvement \n  \nGiven the molecular subdivision of our cohort (see Table  ) we did not have enough subjects to conduct a MD analysis relative to each pure subtype (e.g., MM1, VV1 etc.). Following previous publications by other groups, we subdivided our sCJD cohort of pathology‐proven cases in two different subgroups based on molecular classification: a cortical‐predominant subtype, “cortical subgroup,” (including MM(V)1, MM(V)2C, and VV1 subtypes) and a subcortical‐predominant subtype, “subcortical subgroup” (including VV2 and MV2K subtypes)(Bizzi et al.,  ; Pascuzzo et al.,  ). The molecular classification needed for such a division was available for 27 of the 37 cases. Subjects with the coexistence of multiple molecular subtypes (e.g., MMV1‐2, MMV2K+2C, etc.) which would have a mixture of cortical and subcortical types, however, were excluded from this subgroup analysis, resulting in 19 cortical sCJD subjects (1 MM1, 1 VV1, 2 MM1‐2C, 7 MM2C, 4 MV1, 4 MV2C) and 5 subcortical sCJD subjects (2 MV2K, 3 VV2). \n  \nDemographics of the healthy controls and sporadic CJD cohort \n    \n\n##### Statistics \n  \nAge‐corrected   z  ‐scores were used to compare MD between subjects and controls, and among subgroups (Mann–Whitney). False discovery rate (FDR) adjustment was used for multiple comparison correction. For comparison between cortical and subcortical subgroups, a MANOVA test (Pillai's trace) was also performed (Pillai,  ). A   p   < .05 was considered significant. Statistical testing was performed using Real Statistics Resource Pack software (Release 7.6) and JASP Team (2022), JASP (Version 0.16.1). \n\n\n\n#### Functional imaging \n  \nWe used SPM12 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK) running under Matlab R2014a (MathWorks) to process and analyze functional data. Five initial functional volumes were discarded to allow magnetic field stabilization. Pre‐processing of functional images included the following steps: slice time–correction, spatial realignment, coregistration to the subject's structural T1w image, normalization to the MNI T1 space using the SPM segment module, and the default tissue probability map (unified segmentation) (Ashburner & Friston,  ; Pereira et al.,  ), smoothing with a 6‐mm gaussian kernel, and bandpass temporal filtering to preserve frequencies between 0.0083 and 0.15 Hz. \n\nTwo spherical seed volume of interest (VOI) with a 5 mm radius were used to derive dorsal and ventral DMN (dDMN and vDMN) (Andrews‐Hanna et al.,  ; Damoiseaux,  ; Jones et al.,  ). The two seeds were located within the right posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC), as one of the main hubs of the DMN (Buckner et al.,  ; Leech & Sharp,  ), one for each component of the DMN, following the separation of sub‐networks as suggested by Jones et al (Jones et al.,  ). The two identified seeds were located at the following MNI coordinates: +16, −48, +34 for the dDMN and +12, −54, +14 for the vDMN, with each seed located within the portion of respectively dDMN and vDMN in the right PCC (based on the singlesubject MD maps as reported in the   for further details). \n\nWe extracted the average blood oxygen level‐dependent signal intensity of all voxels within a given seed for each volume throughout each participant's scan using the MARSBAR toolbox for SPM12 (Brett et al.,  ). Resulting region of interest time series served as covariates of interest for whole‐brain voxelwise regression analyses, resulting in a dDMN and vDMN parameter estimate maps for each participant. Covariates of no interest included the mean deep white matter and CSF time‐series, the three rotational and three translational motion parameters, the temporal derivative of each of these terms, and the square of all terms (Satterthwaite et al.,  ). \n\nDorsal and ventral DMN connectivity were examined at a group level. To correct for motion, we used the sum displacement measure during rs‐fMRI acquisition as a covariate. Significance was set at a   p   < .05 FWE corrected, at clusterwise level. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nDescription of the subjects and controls are reported in Table  . The entire sCJD cohort on average had moderate dementia and was mild/moderately functionally impaired, although there was a wide range of impairment. Codon 129 polymorphism distribution in our cohort was over‐represented for MV and VV and under‐represented for MM (Chi‐Square,   p   < .001) (Collins et al.,  ; Parchi et al.,  ). Regarding sCJD molecular classification, the cohort was underrepresented for MM1 and overrepresented for MM2, VV1/2, MV1, and MV1/2 (Kolmogorov–Smirnov,   p   = .001; Table  A,B) (Collins et al.,  ; Parchi et al.,  ). \n\nThe 17 subjects included in the rs‐fMRI analysis had the following molecular classifications: 1 MM1, 3 MV1, 2 MM2C, 3 MV2C, 2 MV2K, 2 VV2, 1 MV1‐2, 1 MM N/A, 1 MV N/A, and 1 VV N/A. They did not differ significantly in MMSE, Barthel score, or time ratio from subjects with only the diffusion dataset (Mann–Whitney,   p   > .05). \n\n\n### Grey matter   MD   analysis \n  \n#### Regional and   VOI   analysis of the entire   sCJD   cohort versus controls \n  \nCompared with controls, MD was reduced in sCJD in cortical and in subcortical GM (  p   < .0001), whereas cerebellar MD was increased, compared with controls (  p   < .05) (Table  , Figure  ). The greatest degree of MD reduction was subcortical, in the thalamus, putamen and GP. Significant MD reduction also was found in the caudate and cortically in two frontal (bilateral rostral‐middlefrontal and right pars orbitalis), three parietal (superior and inferior parietal, precuneus), two limbic (PCC and amygdala), four temporal (fusiform, inferior, middle, and superior temporal) and one occipital (cuneus) regions. No supratentorial region showed increased MD compared with controls (  p   > .05). \n  \nAverage grey matter (GM) mean diffusivity (MD) in sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease cohort by group‐wise analysis \n      \nAverage mean diffusivity (MD) in sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (sCJD) subjects versus healthy controls per brain volumes of interest (VOIs), after correction for multiple comparisons (Mann–Whitney, FDR correction). Different   p   values are reported. The colored areas are regions with significantly reduced (or a trend toward) mean MD in sCJD compared with controls, superposed on the Montreal neurological institute (MNI) atlas. Orientation of image is radiologic (right brain (R) is left side of the image) \n  \n\n#### Analysis by subgroup: Cortical versus subcortical \n  \nIn this sub‐analysis, we compared each sCJD subgroup (cortical or subcortical) with healthy controls, with a VOI‐based analysis. The subcortical subgroup only showed a significant MD reduction for the thalamus, bilaterally (  p   < .05 FDR corrected; Table  ). By contrast, the cortical subgroup showed numerous areas of MD reduction both at cortical and subcortical level. Specifically, the strongest MD reduction (  p   < .001, FDR corrected) was shown for the left and right inferior parietal cortex, right precuneus, and right middle temporal cortex. Extensive involvement of the parietal cortex was found, bilaterally, in addition to the cuneus and lateral occipital regions, middle and inferior temporal regions, and rostral middle‐frontal, among others (Table  ). The cortical subgroup also showed extensive reduction of MD for subcortical regions (  p   < .05, FDR corrected), with the exception of the left thalamus (which showed only a trend toward reduction,   p   < .1) (Table  ). No supratentorial VOI showed a significant increase of MD in sCJD compared with controls. Cerebellar MD was increased in both subgroups compared to HCs, but only the right cerebellar cortex reached a statistical significance (  p   < .05, FDR corrected). \n  \nAverage grey matter (GM) mean diffusivity (MD) in sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease pathology‐proven cohort by subgroup‐wise analysis (cortical and subcortical sCJD subtypes ) \n    \nWe did not find any statistically significant difference in any supratentorial or cerebellar VOI mean diffusivity when comparing cortical and subcortical subgroups in a VOI‐based analysis (Mann–Whitney test,   p   > .05 FDR corrected). Therefore, we performed an additional analysis by clustering cortical regions into five lobar VOIs (frontal, parietal, limbic, temporal, occipital) and combining deep nuclei (caudate, GP, putamen, and thalamus) into a single VOI (VOIs are grouped as in Table  ) to search for any “regional” behavior (data not shown in tables). The subcortical subgroup showed a significant MD reduction in the deep nuclei compared with the cortical sCJD subgroup (MANOVA test,   p   = .0107). By contrast, the cortical sCJD subgroup demonstrated lower parietal (  p   = .044) and limbic GM MD (  p   < .001) compared with the subcortical sCJD subgroup. There was no statistically significant difference in MD between subgroups in any other supratentorial lobe (  p   > .05). \n\n\n\n### Resting‐state functional connectivity \n  \nCompared with controls, the sCJD cohort showed no region of decreased vDMN or dDMN connectivity. Rather, increased connectivity was found in sCJD for dDMN and vDMN seeds, with vDMN having more areas with increased connectivity (supramarginal, posterior cingulate, bilateral cerebellar GM) than the dDMN (precuneus) (  p   < .05, FWE corrected). (Figure  , Table  ). \n  \nIntrinsic resting‐state connectivity for ventral DMN (vDMN) and dorsal (dDMN) seeds. Clusters with a family‐wise error rate (FWE) corrected   p   value < .05 are reported. Increased connectivity in sCJD subjects compared with healthy controls is shown. Ventral DMN is shown in yellow, dorsal DMN in red; overlap areas are shown in orange. HC, healthy controls. Orientation of image is radiologic (right brain (R) is left side of the image) \n    \nResting state DMN connectivity of sCJD subjects versus controls \n    \nWe did not have sufficient sample sizes to investigate functional differences between sCJD molecular subtypes. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nOur diffusion imaging study showed relatively predominant involvement of the posterior portion of the DMN together with subcortical grey matter (striatum, pallidum, and thalamus) in sCJD. For the first time, we identified abnormally increased functional connectivity at rest in sCJD, both in the dorsal and ventral components of the DMN. Our multimodal analysis corroborates our atrophy‐based hypothesis that DMN areas are particularly vulnerable in sCJD (Younes et al.,  ). \n\n### Grey matter mean diffusivity quantification in   sCJD  \n  \n#### Subcortical MD \n  \nWe showed significant MD reduction in our sCJD cohort in the caudate and putamen, consistent with traditional visual assessment studies of conventional three‐directions DWI/ADC images (Meissner et al.,  ; Shiga et al.,  ; Vitali et al.,  ) and also with our previous MD quantification study at 1.5T (Caverzasi, Henry, et al.,  ). We also confirmed our prior finding that despite DWI/ADC abnormalities being less common in the thalamus (than striatum or cortex) and very rare in the GP by visual assessment (Meissner et al.,  ; Murata et al.,  ; Vitali et al.,  ), these regions showed significant MD reduction at 3T (Figure  , Table  ), with even greater significance than in our prior 1.5T study (Caverzasi, Henry, et al.,  ). In fact, the thalami showed the most significant MD reduction across all subcortical VOIs (Table  ). This was surprising as the most sCJD patients do not have thalamic involvement by visual assessment, and even in molecular subtypes with common thalamic FLAIR/DWI involvement, less than 50% of cases have abnormal thalami by visual assessment (Meissner et al.,  ). Grau‐Rivera and colleagues with a ROI‐based analysis found significant deep nuclei MD reduction, also with a few thalamic nuclei with increased MD, in a cohort of 13 sCJD and two E200K genetic prion cases (Grau‐Rivera et al.,  ). Given its high degree of interconnection, the thalamus has been proposed as a relay center of primary importance in prion diseases (Grau‐Rivera et al.,  ). Clinical and experimental evidence has suggested early thalamic involvement in prion disease (Jeffrey et al.,  ; Lee et al.,  ; Tschampa et al.,  ); typical sCJD symptoms as myoclonus and periodic sharp wave complexes have been associated with thalamic involvement in the disease (Tschampa et al.,  ). The lack of clear signal abnormality by visual assessment in the GP has been attributed to possible interference from iron deposition (Lin et al.,  ), but this does not explain why the thalamus is not as frequently involved by visual assessment (Lin et al.,  ; Meissner et al.,  ; Tschampa et al.,  ; Vitali et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Cortical MD \n  \nIn the cortex, we found the most significant MD reduction in posterior cingulate, superior parietal, middle and inferior temporal regions, which are known to be part of DMN, also consistent with our prior study at 1.5T (Caverzasi, Henry, et al.,  ) (Table  , Figure  ). The only other study examining MD at 3T in sCJD did not find any significant cortical MD reduction, but found increased MD in subcortical white matter and a few subcortical regions (Grau‐Rivera et al.,  ). One possible reason for the different findings is that Grau‐Rivera et al. included E200K genetic in their cohort, which generally has more predominant subcortical than cortical involvement (Lee et al.,  ). Furthermore, Grau‐Rivera et al. did not have an analysis with all CJD subtypes combined (as we have)—they divided them into CJD and fatal insomnia (FI) based on clinical characterization. No insular or precentral cortex involvement was demonstrated by our 3T quantitative analysis, as per our previous 1.5T analysis (Caverzasi, Henry, et al.,  ). The lack of insular involvement in the present study is also consistent with the choice of excluding insula in proposed MRI diagnostic criteria (Bizzi et al.,  ; Vitali et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n### Analysis by cortical and subcortical   sCJD   subgroups \n  \n#### Subcortical MD \n  \nWe demonstrated that, compared with controls, the subcortical sCJD subgroup (i.e., MV2K and VV2,   n   = 5) had reduced MD in all subcortical VOIs, yet only thalami reached statistical significance (after correction for FDR), whereas the cortical sCJD subgroup had a significant MD reduction in all subcortical VOIs (with the exception of left thalamus). The paucity of findings in the subcortical sCJD subgroup is most likely due to the very small number of cases available for this analysis (  n   = 5). The extensive and bilateral MD reduction within subcortical GM regions of the cortical sCJD subgroup and the limited involvement (only the thalamus) in the subcortical sCJD subgroup is only partially surprising. Indeed, these findings fit into the model of disease propagation proposed in literature (Caverzasi, Henry, et al.,  ; Pascuzzo et al.,  ), once we consider that sCJD subjects enrolled in the current study had on average a relatively advanced stage of illness (time ratio = 0.64 ± 0.25, median = 0.71). At this stage of disease, subcortical regions of the subcortical sCJD subgroup (characterized by early subcortical involvement) may have already pseudo‐normalized their mean diffusivity signal (Caverzasi, Henry, et al.,  ) and, by contrast, they may have been more recently affected by the disease in the cortical sCJD subgroup (e.g., with more pronounced MD reduction). \n\n\n#### Cortical MD \n  \nAs expected, the sCJD cortical subgroup had multiple cortical regions with significant MD reduction, including the entire parietal lobe (surprisingly including the left postcentral, which is usually spared by visual assessment of DWI/ADC), cuneus, lateral occipital regions, and parts of the temporal (middle and inferior temporal above all) and frontal lobes (Table  ). This pattern of involvement greatly overlaps with the DMN (Alves et al.,  ), except for sparing of involvement in our cohort of the medial orbito‐frontal regions. This pattern of cortical involvement is consistent with what was found by Pascuzzo and colleagues using a visual assessment approach (Pascuzzo et al.,  ). The subcortical sCJD group, instead, showed no area of cortical MD reduction despite being slightly more advanced in the disease time course compared with the cortical subgroup (subcortical group average time ratio = 0.73, range = 0.47–1; cortical group average time ratio = 0.59, range 0.11–0.91). This may indicate greater variability than expected in the spreading of diffusion abnormalities from subcortical toward cortical regions in this sCJD subgroup. One must take into consideration, however, that this finding is based on a limited number of subjects (  n   = 5). \n\nWhen we explored differences between subgroups, we found that the cortical sCJD subgroup had a significantly lower MD in the parietal and limbic lobes compared with the subcortical subgroup. The more extensive involvement of the parietal cortex in the cortical subgroup was expected based on the propagation model by Pascuzzo and colleagues mentioned above. That we found greater limbic involvement (hippocampus, amygdala, and cingulate) in the cortical than the subcortical subgroup was surprising, because Pascuzzo et al. found in intermediate to late‐intermediate stages of the disease propagation model that these regions seemed to be affected in both subgroups (Pascuzzo et al.,  ). Further diffusivity studies based on larger datasets are needed to better investigate these overlapping yet distinct findings between the two studies. \n\n\n\n### Increased cerebellar mean diffusivity in   sCJD  \n  \nIn contrast to most supratentorial regions, the cerebellar cortex of the sCJD cohort had increased MD compared with controls (Table  ). This finding corroborates the sparse literature on cerebellar GM diffusivity in prion diseases, which showed increased ADC (assessed by conventional three‐directions DWI) (Cohen et al.,  ) or increased MD (with a DTI approach)(Grau‐Rivera et al.,  ). Such a different pattern of diffusion changes between cerebellar and supratentorial regions has been previously explained as possibly due to different underlying pathological substrates (Cohen et al.,  ) or time sequence of pathology (Iwasaki,  ; Parchi et al.,  ,  ), slightly different forms of prions affecting the cerebellum (Puoti et al.,  ), and/or different neurochemical changes than elsewhere (Ferrer et al.,  ). At our subgroup‐level analysis, only the cortical sCJD subgroup showed a significant MD increase compared with controls (and only for the right cerebellar cortex). This finding of increased cerebellar MD can be explained by the quasi‐J‐shaped curve of MD changes over time in sCJD (Caverzasi, Henry, et al.,  ) and Pascuzzo and colleagues' model (Pascuzzo et al.,  ). Indeed, based on the model by Pascuzzo et al., the subcortical sCJD subgroup presents with early involvement of the cerebellum, whereas the cortical subgroup shows later cerebellar involvement. The model by Pascuzzo et al. also fits with what is known clinically in sCJD, that the subcortical group subtypes (VV2 and MV2) usually present with early cerebellar features, such as ataxia (Parchi et al.,  ). Although only our cortical subgroup had statistically significant increased MD, and only in the right cerebellum, even the left cerebellum was higher than controls (although not statistically significant), and the subcortical group cerebellum showed the highest MD (also not statistically significant, likely due to the small sample size). \n\n\n### Increased   DMN   connectivity in   sCJD  \n  \nIn our resting‐state fMRI analysis, we found an increased connectivity in sCJD both for dDMN and vDMN seeds, with more areas involved for the vDMN (Figure  , Table  ). A topographic division of DMN into ventral (vDMN) and dorsal (dDMN) components has been proposed in the literature (Andrews‐Hanna et al.,  ; Damoiseaux,  ; Jones et al.,  ), with the vDMN being linked to internally directed thought at rest, including memory retrieval and planning, and the dDMN being involved with the control of attentional focus and having a high degree of interconnections with other cognitive networks (Fornito et al.,  ; Leech et al.,  ; Leech & Sharp,  ; Margulies et al.,  ). As both DMN components support dissociable cognitive processes, it is possible that the lesser involvement of the dDMN in sCJD in this study is related to the relatively less involvement of mesial frontal regions in our cohort compared with involvement of other DMN regions in our sCJD cohort (Table  ). Regarding the cerebellum, as with some bilateral cortical regions, it showed increased vDMN connectivity (Figure  , Table  ) (Buckner et al.,  ; Yeo et al.,  ). Examining our diffusion and functional data, the cerebellar response to prion involvement may differ from that of supratentorial cortical and subcortical regions. Despite the cerebellum having increased MD and cortex having reduced MD, in fact, both show increased functional connectivity. \n\nIncreased connectivity of resting‐state functional networks has been described in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Zhou et al.,  ), subjects at risk of Alzheimer's disease (Filippini et al.,  ; Hafkemeijer et al.,  ; Kerestes et al.,  ; Petrella et al.,  ), and schizophrenia (Whitfield‐Gabrieli et al.,  ), especially in the prodromal state. Different explanations have been proposed including compensatory mechanisms occurring with relatively low disease burden (Agosta et al.,  ; Farb et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ) in an attempt to recruit relatively preserved areas in order to maintain function, a maladaptive response of hyperconnectivity to an underlying pathologic process, and/or to excitatory‐inhibitory imbalance of functional networks (Douaud et al.,  ; Farb et al.,  ; Lehmann et al.,  ; Pievani et al.,  ; Wu et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ). The functional connectivity abnormality in sCJD raises questions regarding how neurodegenerative diseases spread in the brain, and whether there are common pathways of spreading, despite diverse pathologic entities (Brettschneider et al.,  ; Frost & Diamond,  ; Raj et al.,  ; Sanders et al.,  ; Seeley et al.,  ; Stopschinski & Diamond,  ; Watts & Prusiner,  ). Misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative disease show propagation along neural processes, involving local and subsequently long‐range circuits via trans‐synaptic spread (Holmes & Diamond,  ; Scott et al.,  ). Disease spreading might be predicted according to a number of structural, metabolic, physiologic, and functional networks (Raj et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ). Improved understanding of functional connectivity in neurodegenerative diseases could stimulate development of new network‐based diagnostics and allow improved monitoring of disease progression for treatment trials. This might be even more true for rapidly progressive dementias, such as prion diseases, in which there is a great need for better outcomes than survival (Mead et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Study limitations \n  \nSeveral limitations apply to our study, some of which have already been discussed. Although our cohort included only 37 subjects, it was very large for a quantitative imaging study in prion disease and has the advantage of the homogeneity of images obtained at a single site. As already mentioned, our cohort was overrepresented by some slower progressing subtypes, with fewer faster progressing molecular subtypes (e.g., MM1 and VV2) and had a different proportion of the three Codon 129 subtypes than present in large multinational cohorts. Although all molecular subtypes were represented in our final study cohort, patients with too much motion artifact (which likely was more common in faster progressing sCJD subtypes) for volumetric T1 and/or HARDI analyses were not included. Thus, our results might be more relevant to the slower progressing group of patients or those in less advanced stages of disease regardless of molecular subtype. Our patients were on average mild to moderately functionally impaired based on Barthel median score of 70/100 and they were about 2/3 of the way through their disease course. \n\nPartial volume effects of CSF adjacent to grey matter would result in increased MD in the adjacent grey matter regions. Thus, if we had accounted for partial volume effects in this study, this would have led to removing this increased MD effect, resulting it making it more likely to find reduced MD. We therefore conservatively decided to not account for partial volume effects in our diffusion analysis, reducing the likelihood of finding reduced MD. Thus, there is probably even greater reduced MD in the caudate, cortex, and possibly thalamic regions than we have reported here. \n\nRegarding our rs‐fMRI dataset, motion could have affected our results, as clinically advanced subjects are more prone to motion during MRI acquisition. We excluded, however, only two subjects out of 19 and motion was used as an additional covariate for network analysis. Thus, we do not think motion artifact affected our results significantly. Larger sample sizes, however, would allow us to confirm our results and better detect abnormal connectivity in each sCJD molecular subtype. \n\nLastly, although we acquired serial imaging on most subjects, because of the difficulty in acquiring serial imaging of sufficient quality due to the rapidity of disease progression, we were unable to perform longitudinal analyses. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nOur quantitative analysis of GM diffusivity in sCJD at 3T confirmed our prior findings at 1.5T of predominant MD reduction in subcortical, retrosplenial, parietal‐occipital, and temporal regions (Caverzasi, Henry, et al.,  ), largely part of the Default Mode Network, and we also confirmed increased MD in the cerebellum previously reported by others (Grau‐Rivera et al.,  ). We also found, quantitively, MD reduction in cortical and subcortical subgroups of sCJD based on molecular classification. Assessing resting‐state functional connectivity in prion disease for the first time, we identified increased connectivity of the Default Mode Network in sCJD, in parallel to extensive parietal and temporal reduced mean diffusivity. In prion disease, rs‐fMRI might represent a useful additional tool to understand underlying disease physiology and perhaps even predict progression, providing new tools to track of disease involvement and progression. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nMatteo Paoletti, Eduardo Caverzasi, and Michael D.

Using the seed-based method of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), the whole-brain FC with bilateral hippocampus as seed was performed, and the FC values were extracted from the bilateral hippocampus. We observed that AD patients demonstrated disruptive FC in some brain regions in the left hippocampal functional network, including right gyrus rectus, right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, bilateral precuneus, bilateral angular gyrus, and bilateral middle occipital gyrus. In addition, decreased FC was detected in some brain regions in the right hippocampal functional network, including bilateral anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. Bilateral hippocampal radiomics features were calculated and selected using the A.K. software. Finally, Pearson’s correlation analyses were conducted between these selected features and the bilateral hippocampal FC values. The results suggested that two gray level run-length matrix (RLM) radiomic features and one gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) radiomic feature weakly associated with FC values in the left hippocampus. However, there were no significant correlations between radiomic features and FC values in the right hippocampus. These findings present that the AD group showed abnormalities in the bilateral hippocampal functional network. This is a prospective study that revealed the weak correlation between the MRI radiomic features and the intrahippocampal FC in AD patients. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with main symptoms of chronic primary memory loss and cognitive impairment. AD has become a public health problem due to its hidden onset, high incidence, and lack of effective drug treatment. The exact cause of AD is still unclear. It is believed some may be related to heredity, neurotransmitter changes, virus infection, immune dysfunction, and free radical damage. Nowadays, the clinical diagnosis of AD is based on cognitive measures and one or more biomarkers including structural MRI, PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of amyloid β or tau proteins ( ). Researchers are investigating non-invasive neuroimaging biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD ( ;  ). \n\nCell degeneration in the hippocampus plays an important role in the onset of AD. It proved to be the cause of AD that amyloid-β plaques and Tau proteins are selectively deposited in the special cortex of the hippocampus in AD patients ( ;  ). These special cortexes are the main pathways that connect the hippocampus to the other cortexes of the brain. A large number of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have revealed atrophy and some other changes in microstructure in the hippocampus in AD dementia ( ; ). \n\nMRI is an important technique for radiomics. MR images can acquire numerous sequences and do not receive a radiation dose. MRI shows both the structural change and the functional dynamic change. Several MRI techniques have been applied in AD research, including voxel-based morphometry ( ), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) ( ), resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI;  ), as well as radiomics analysis ( ). Radiomics is a new frontier subject based on quantitative imaging, feature calculation, feature selection, and model construction. It uses a large number of automated feature extraction algorithms to transform the original image data into first-order or higher-order data, and then analyzes the deep relationship between the data to further improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and prognostic value. Radiomics has strong power for radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy evaluation ( ;  ;  ), cancer patients survival prediction ( ), molecular subtyping of tumor ( ), and cancer recurrence prediction ( ). Nowadays, radiomics is also applied to non-tumor diseases, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ) and autism spectrum disorder ( ). In this context, we select the high-resolution T1-weighted MR images for hippocampal microstructural radiomics analysis. \n  \nDemographics and cognitive characteristics of the participants. \n    \nRs-fMRI is a functional MRI technique that based on blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD), and has emerged as one of the most important techniques for analysis of human brain function. Functional connectivity (FC) is the indirect reflection of synaptic connections. Rs-fMRI FC analysis is increasingly used to detect brain network changes in AD. There are two main methods used in rs-fMRI FC analysis. One is the “seed-based” approach, and the other is independent component analysis (ICA). In seed-based analysis, first, you need to set up a region of interest (ROI), then select BOLD signal fluctuations from the ROI, and associate them with BOLD signal fluctuations for all other voxels in the brain ( ). The default mode network (DMN) is most commonly shown to be active when a person is not focused on the outside world and the brain is at wakeful rest, such as during daydreaming and mind-wandering. It is highly correlated with cognitive function ( ). FC altered in DMN becomes a potential non-invasive biomarker in diagnosis of AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) ( ;  ;  ;  ). Functional activity in the hippocampus is the hot topic of AD research. One study found decreased synchrony of low-frequency fluctuations within the hippocampus in AD patients ( ). An ICA study of fMRI showed that the hippocampal activity diminished in AD ( ). Intrinsic connectivity altered in hippocampal functional networks has been observed in aMCI patients ( ). However, most of the rs-fMRI studies were focused on the DMN and some local brain regions; little is known regarding the hippocampus functional network. \n  \nRegions showing altered FC for AD patients and NC subjects with the left hippocampus as seed. \n    \nMany studies investigated the altered structure or function in the hippocampus in AD patients. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the relationship between hippocampal microstructure and FC in AD. The hypothesis of the present study is that the local structural change in hippocampus is correlated to the functional changes of the brain in AD patients. The aim of the study was to investigate the correlation between hippocampal MRI radiomic features and intrahippocampal FC in AD, and to explore non-invasive imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Study Cohort \n  \nThere were 82 AD patients and 50 normal controls (NCs) recruited initially. AD patients were enrolled prospectively in the study at the Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital from September 2016 to June 2018. The NCs were volunteers collected from the health promotion center of the hospital. All subjects were right-handed and provided written informed consent. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital (No. 2012KY002) and had been carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n  \nRegions showing altered FC for AD patients and NC subjects with the right hippocampus as seed. \n    \nAll subjects underwent medical history collection, laboratory examination, neuropsychological test, physical examination, and conventional brain MRI scans. The neuropsychological tests included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Scale (MoCA). AD patients were diagnosed in terms of the revised NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association) criteria ( ) with MMSE score ≤ 24 and MoCA score ≤ 26. The inclusion criteria for NC subjects were as follows: (1) no neurological deficits, such as hearing or vision loss; (2) no neurological or mental diseases, such as stroke, epilepsy, or depression; (3) no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, or tumor on routine MRI; and (4) MMSE score ≥ 28. For both AD and NC groups, the exclusion criteria were (1) stroke; (2) brain trauma; (3) brain tumors, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and other neurological diseases that cause memory disorders; (4) serious anemia, hypertension, diabetes, and other systemic diseases; (5) history of mental illness; and (6) signal abnormalities in the medial temporal lobe caused by infectious or vascular factors on MRI FLAIR or T2 images ( ). There were 73 AD patients and 45 NC subjects who completed all the required MR sequences successfully. \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nEach subject underwent both structural and fMRI examinations on a 3.0-T MR scanner (Discovery MR750; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, United States). The structural MRIs were acquired using a high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sagittal sequence with scanning parameters of repetition time (TR) = 6.7 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.9 ms, inversion time (TI) = 450 ms, slice thickness/gap = 1/0 mm, FOV = 256 × 256 mm , flip angle = 12°, matrix = 256 × 256; there were 192 sagittal slices collected from each subject. The rs-fMRI images were acquired using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with scanning parameters of TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 30 ms, slice thickness/gap = 3.2/0 mm, FOV = 220 × 220 mm , and flip angle = 90°. Each rs-fMRI sequence contained 210 time points and each time point contained 44 slices. During rs-fMRI, all subjects were instructed to keep still and keep their eyes closed, but to not fall asleep. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of Resting-State Functional MRI \n  \nThe image analysis of rs-fMRI after acquisition consists of preprocessing and FC analysis. The preprocessing was performed using the Data Processing Assistant for rs-fMRI (DPARSF ). The preprocessing steps were as follows: \n  \nremoving the first 10 time points (considering the time when the magnetic field of the machine was stable and the time when the subject adapted to the environment); \n  \nslice timing correction and head motion correction; \n  \nnormalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and resampling (with voxels of 3 × 3 × 3 mm); \n  \nspatial smoothing using a 4-mm isotropic Gaussian kernel; removing the linear trend; bandpass filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz); and \n  \nregression of covariates, including the six head motion parameters, the white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid signal. \n  \n\n### Segmentation of Hippocampus \n  \nThe 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE images were used in the hippocampus segmentation using an efficient learning-based deformable model ( ). A joint classification and regression model was established to predict the location of the hippocampus. In the training stage, the extracted features were used to train the structured random forest classifier, and in the testing stage, the extracted features were input into the classifier in order to predict the segmentation of each hippocampus, and the prediction segmentation is iteratively improved through the training model. Finally, the hippocampal shape model gradually deformed to the target image to adapt the target hippocampus. We used this method to segment the right and left hippocampus, respectively. The segmentation results had been checked by a senior neuroradiologist, and the data with poor segmentation quality were resegmented. \n\n\n### Resting-State Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nThe FC analysis of the bilateral hippocampus network was performed using REST plus V1.2 . We took the averaged time courses of all voxels in ROI (above segmented left and right hippocampus as defined) as the reference sequence. And Pearson’s correlation was conducted between the BOLD time course within the ROI and each voxel in the brain. Then, ROI-wise whole-brain FC maps were obtained. Fisher’s   r  -to-  z   transformation was used to convert FC maps into normalized zFC maps for subsequent statistical analyses. One-sample   t  -test was conducted in the AD and NC groups to make a mask using Gaussian random field (GFR) correction. Two-sample   t  -test was then performed using the above mask between the AD and NC groups. Then, GFR correction was performed (voxel-level   P   < 0.05, cluster-level   P   < 0.05, two-tailed). Finally, the brain areas of significant differences were obtained. Furthermore, in order to quantify the FC values of the bilateral hippocampus in the brain network for next correlation analysis, the mean   Z  -value within the bilateral hippocampus was calculated using the above segmented left and right hippocampus images as ROI definition. The mean   Z  -value represents the average FC value within the hippocampus. These steps were performed in the left and right hippocampus data, respectively. \n\n\n### MRI Radiomic Analysis \n  \nArtificial Intelligence Kit (A.K) is a commercially available software developed by GE Healthcare Institute of Precision Medicine. It performs data loading, segmentation, feature calculation, feature selection, and model establishment of radiomics. \n\nFirst, we loaded the original 3D T1-weighted images and ROI images into the A.K. software. Then, image features were calculated including Formfactor, Histogram, Haralick, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and gray level run-length matrix (RLM). Formfactor features use mathematical methods to characterize the shape of the lesion, and describe the shape and compactness of the lesion. Histogram features calculate the gray intensity information of the lesion and describe the overall distribution of gray level information. GLCM obtains the co-occurrence matrix by counting the probability of the occurrence of pixel pairs in different directions and displacement vectors. It describes the complexity of the lesion, the level variation, and the degree of texture thickness ( ). Haralick also based on the co-occurrence matrix to extract the corresponding features, but it has directional invariance. RLM obtains the length matrix by calculating the probability of the pixels appearing repeatedly in succession with different directions and displacement vectors. It also describes the complexity of the lesion, the level variation and the degree of texture thickness ( ). We chose “1, 4, and 7” for displacement vectors. \n\nAfter feature calculation, we added labels “0” and “1” for each subject data representing NC and AD. The preprocessing for feature selection included replaced the abnormal value with the mean; set the training set proportion and testing set proportion to 0.7 and 0.3, respectively, and eliminate the unit restriction for each feature column through normalization. The feature selection steps were as follows. Step 1:   T  -test and rank sum test were used to identify the features with significant differences between the two groups (  P   < 0.05). Step 2: The correlation analysis was used to reduce the dimension. The filter threshold was set to 0.9, and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was selected. Correlation analysis was performed between any two feature columns; one of the two highly correlated features was removed when the correlation coefficient was greater than 0.9. Step 3: The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was applied to reduce the dimension using 10-fold cross-validation. This method is applicable to the regression analysis of high-dimensional data. We performed feature selection on the left and right hippocampus data, respectively. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nDemographic, neuropsychological comparison, RS FC comparison of the two groups, and correlation analysis between the bilateral hippocampus radiomic features and FC were performed using SPSS version 22.0. All statistical methods about radiomic analysis were performed using the A.K. software. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Comparison of Demographic and Neuropsychological Performance \n  \nAmong the remaining 73 AD patients and 45 NC subjects, 67 AD patients and 44 NC subjects were finally collected for analysis, who had head motion <3.0 mm translation and 3.0° rotation in any direction during preprocessing of rs-fMRI.   showed the statistical analysis results of demographics and neuropsychological performance. There was no significant difference between AD and NC subjects in demographics (  P   > 0.05). However, there were statistically significant differences in MMSE performance between the two groups (  P   < 0.05). \n\n\n### Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nAfter two-sample   t  -tests, RS FC had no significant difference between AD and NC within the left hippocampal mask (  t   = 0.34,   P   > 0.05) and the right hippocampal mask (  t   = −1.01,   P   > 0.05). In addition, we observed that FC in some brain regions was disrupted in the left hippocampal functional network in the AD patient group; these regions are right gyrus rectus, right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, right orbital part of middle frontal gyrus, right caudate nucleus, left and right precuneus, left median cingulate and paracingulate gyri, left and right angular gyrus, left and right middle occipital gyrus, and inferior parietal but supramarginal and angular gyri (  and  ). We also observed some brain regions with decreased FC in the right hippocampal functional network, including left and right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, right median cingulate and paracingulate gyri, right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and right middle frontal gyrus (  and  ). \n  \nThe left hippocampus seed-based functional connectivity (FC) maps in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients compared with normal control (NC) subjects. \n    \nThe right hippocampus seed-based FC maps in the AD patients compared with NC subjects. \n    \nCorrelation between the left hippocampal radiomic features and functional connectivity values. \n      \nCorrelation between the right hippocampal radiomic features and functional connectivity values. \n    \n\n### Radiomic Analysis \n  \nThere were 385 features extracted in the bilateral hippocampus after feature calculation. For left and right hippocampus, after   T  -test and rank sum test, the remaining feature numbers were 196 and 215. After correlation analysis, the remaining feature numbers were reduced to 70 and 81 ( ). Finally, using the LASSO regression model, five and four features were selected ( ,  ). \n  \nCorrelation analysis graph of the left hippocampus   (A)  .

However, there were no significant correlations between selected radiomic features and FC values in the right hippocampus ( ). \n  \nLASSO dimensionality reduction of the right hippocampus.

Meanwhile, the present study selected the closely related radiomic features of the bilateral hippocampus. Pearson correlation analysis suggested weak relationship between some radiomic features and FC values in the left hippocampus. It’s a prospective paper to study the correlation between the hippocampal radiomic features and fMRI characteristics in AD. \n\nIn addition to hippocampal structural studies, some rs-fMRI studies suggest that hippocampal functional characteristics changed in the AD or aMCI stage. For example,   found that only selected brain areas such as the hippocampus showed reduced activities in MCI patients. Some AD and MCI studies indicated the destruction of functional connections between the hippocampus and the PCC, medial prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and other brain areas ( ;  ;  ). One study showed alterations of three hippocampal subfield functional networks in aMCI patients ( ). Our results have demonstrated diminished FC in the right gyrus rectus, right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, bilateral precuneus, bilateral angular gyrus, and bilateral middle occipital gyrus of the left hippocampus functional networks. We also observed some brain regions of decreased FC in the right hippocampal functional network, including bilateral anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. Some of these brain regions are major components of the DMN. Most seed-based and ICA studies have shown that functional connections of DMN and other brain networks are reduced in AD or MCI ( ;  ). We observed no increase or decrease of FC in PCC; maybe there are both disruption and compensation effects in the AD stage. However, many studies have reported areas of aberrant increased connectivity in AD ( ;  ;  ). An ICA study by   showed that the FC of posterior DMN began to decrease in the early stage of AD patients, while the connection increased within the anterior and ventral DMN. As the disease progressed, all Internet connections decreased. We observed most of the regions of decreased FC in the bilateral hippocampal functional networks, probably because patients with severe AD were in the majority of our AD subjects. Moreover, the disruption patterns of the left and right hippocampal networks are different in AD and aMCI patients ( ;  ). Our result was consistent with these recent discoveries. \n\nRadiomics analysis has been applied to some neuropsychiatric diseases. A radiomics study about autism spectrum disorder found significant differences in the texture features in the right hippocampus, corpus callosum, cerebellar white matter, and left choroid plexus between patients and controls ( ). Some texture analysis studies have found that there are texture differences in hippocampus, corpus callosum, and thalamus between AD patients and NCs ( ;  ). The nine radiomic features selected in this study reflect the differences in image gray value distribution, texture characteristics, spatial heterogeneity, and other microstructural information in AD patients. Among the five selected features of the left hippocampus, “RunLengthNonuniformity_angle45_ offset1,” “LowGreyLevelRunEmphasis_AllDirection_offset1,” “LowGreyLevel RunEmphasis_AllDirection_offset7_SD,” and “GreyLevelNonuniformity_AllDirection_offset1” are RLM parameters. The higher the value of “RunLengthNonuniformity” or “GreyLevelNonuniformity” is, the more heterogeneous the lesion is. “LowGreyLevelRunEmphasis” describes the overall brightness of the lesion; the higher the value, the darker the lesion. “Correlation_angle135_offset1” is one of the GLCM parameters. “Correlation” describes the similarity of the gray levels in adjacent pixels and displays the correlation between a pixel and its neighbors across the image. Among the four selected features of the right hippocampus, “ShortRunEmphasis_angle90_offset7” and “GreyLevelNonuniformity_AllDirection_offset1” are RLM parameters. “ShortRunEmphasis” describes the degree of difference in gray value between adjacent pixels of the lesion; the higher the value is, the more complex and heterogeneous the lesion is. “GLCMEntropy_AllDirection_offset1_SD” is a GLCM parameter. “Entropy” describes the complexity of the co-occurrence matrix; the larger the value is, the more complex the co-occurrence matrix will be. “SurfaceVolumeRatio” is a Formfactor parameter; it describes the three-dimensional size and shape of the hippocampus. If the edge irregularity of three-dimensional lesions is large, the ratio is also large, indicating greater heterogeneity. These features extracted from the hippocampus structure reflect high-order imaging patterns and heterogeneity characteristics of microstructure in hippocampus in AD patients. \n\nAlthough there was no significant difference in hippocampal FC between the two groups, there were significant differences in hippocampal radiomic features. In addition, our study showed weak and negative correlation between the intrahippocampal FC and the radiomic features. It suggests that the changes of hippocampal microstructure appeared before the changes of hippocampal function in AD patients. MR volumetry and DTI studies indicated the decreased volumes and increased mean diffusivity of the hippocampus in AD patients ( ;  ). Structural MRI studies have shown that microstructural abnormalities of the hippocampus can be the neuroimaging biomarkers of early cognitive impairment. In future studies, we will pay more attention to the study of hippocampal microstructure to provide imaging basis for the early diagnosis of AD. The occurrence and development of AD is a complex process, and we can obtain more structural and functional information by using a variety of MRI techniques in future studies. \n\nHowever, there were several limitations in our study. Firstly, a complete 1:1 match in age and sex ratio had not been achieved. Secondly, although patients with MCI were excluded, the severity of the disease in AD patients was not distinguished in the study, and these subjects were not followed up. Mild, moderate, and severe AD patients were all included in the AD group. Lastly, we did not correct the between-group comparison of RS FC adjusting for hippocampal volume. It may influence the results to a certain degree. \n\nIn summary, this study observed that there are decreased activity in hippocampus functional network in AD patients. It also indicates that the closely related hippocampal radiomic features can be neuroimaging biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD. Moreover, we explored the correlations between the MRI radiomic features and intrahippocampal FC in AD patients. It provides a very important reference for further understanding the pathogenesis of AD. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of “Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital (No. 2012KY002)” with written informed consent from all subjects.

Thalamus-related dysfunction might be a potential trait marker of major depressive disorder (MDD), but the abnormal changes in the thalamus based on R-fMRI are still unclear from the perspective of brain temporal dynamics. The aim of this study was to identify local entropy changes and subregional connectivity patterns of the thalamus in MDD patients. \n\n\n## Patients and methods \n  \nWe measured the sample entropy of the R-fMRI data from 46 MDD patients and 32 matched healthy controls. We employed the Louvain method for the module detection algorithm to automatically identify a functional parcellation of the thalamus and then examined the whole-brain subregional connectivity patterns. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe results indicated that the MDD patients had decreased entropy in the bilateral thalami compared with healthy controls. Increased functional connectivity between the thalamic subregions and the medial part of the superior frontal gyrus (mSFG) was found in MDD patients. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis study showed new evidence about sample entropy changes in MDD patients. The functional connectivity alterations that were widely distributed across almost all the thalamic subregions with the mSFG in MDD suggest a general involvement independent of the location and function of the subregions. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a commonly encountered psychological or psychiatric disorder characterized by pervasive and persistent low mood, accompanied by physical symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and impaired social function.  This disorder, with its high levels of morbidity and mortality, contributes to increased suicide rates and various unfavourable medical outcomes.  The underlying pathology of MDD is under continuous investigation, although there is now increasing evidence for biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to MDD.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have contributed greatly to the identification of neurobiological correlates of MDD in recent years and provided converging evidence in support of neuropathology in this disorder. –  Many studies have shown that thalamic abnormalities might be potential neuroimaging-based markers of MDD. ,  The characteristic clinical symptoms and associated cognitive deficits of MDD may arise, in part, through the corresponding dysfunction of thalamus-related brain circuits. \n\nThe thalamus is a subcortical structure located near the brain centre, with nerve fibres projecting into multiple directions. This region is a relay for – and an integration hub of – neural pathways, including the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop or thalamo-cortical system. ,  Anatomically, the thalamus is a complex structure organized in many nuclei subserving various functions, and these have highly selective connectivity patterns with some specific areas. ,  For example, the dorsal thalamic nuclei integrate and relay sensory information to the cerebral cortex. The anterior thalamic nuclei have reciprocal connections with the cingulate gyrus and hypothalamus. However, aberrations in these relay connections of the thalamus have also been reported in MDD.  Considering the thalamic heterogeneity and its association with MDD neuropathology, ,  it is inadequate to examine functional deficits from the perspective of a single region of interest (ROI) in the thalamus. Previous studies divided the thalamus into several parts to examine the functional specialization of different thalamic subregions. ,  Kong et al  partitioned the whole cortex into six large areas, namely, the prefrontal, motor, somatosensory, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex, and used them as seeds to examine functional connectivity patterns with each thalamic voxel. Based on specific connectivity patterns of each cortical subdivision, they identified six thalamic parcellations and then examined their whole-brain connectivity patterns. They found MDD-related abnormalities in the connectivity patterns of the prefrontal, motor, somatosensory, and parietal thalamic subdivisions, with both hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity. One issue of this study was that the six areas of the whole cortex were not well defined and might affect functional parcellation within the thalamus. \n\nEntropy is usually described as the degree of uncertainty or disorder in a system that is a property of the system’s state. In recent years, this method provides a means to quantify resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) data presenting ongoing fluctuating activity in the brain,  and it further facilitates research on the potential functional architecture of the brain.  This temporal brain entropy with high levels of entropy corresponds to low levels of predictability and high levels of randomness.  Based on R-fMRI data acquired from 1049 subjects and statistical threshold (p < 0.01, corrected for multiple comparison), Wang et al have shown reliably distributed brain entropy patterns in the normal brain, such as the hierarchical structure.  The brain entropy dynamics were altered in neuropsychological or psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia,  Alzheimer’s disease,  relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,  and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.  However, it remains unknown whether the entropy patterns of thalamic subregions are differentially disrupted in MDD. \n\nIn the present study, we were to locate the entropy alterations across the whole brain in MDD patients. Meanwhile, automated functional parcellation of the thalamus was performed using a module detection algorithm based on all pairwise correlation coefﬁcients between the voxel time series and the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of each thalamic parcellation was also traced. Considering that the thalamus was significantly involved in MDD,  which is often manifested in abnormal local regional activity  and dysregulation in the thalamo-cortical system,  we hypothesized that MDD patients showed disrupted brain entropy in the thalamus and abnormal thalamic RSFC with cerebral regions. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nForty-six patients with MDD (age: 28.32±8.55 yrs, 13 males/33 females) and 32 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HC, age: 27.19±10.29 yrs, 10 males/22 females) were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry of Hangzhou Seventh People’s Hospital and the Department of Psychiatry at the Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University. All subjects were right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.  MDD subjects were diagnosed based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria using the Mini-Neuropsychiatric International Interview (MINI). The demographic data and clinical characteristics of the participants are listed in  .   \nDemographic And Clinical Data \n    \n\nAll patients were interviewed by certified psychiatrists, and the severity of depressive symptoms was evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; Hamilton, 1967). Participants were administered the Life Events Scale (LES) to assess the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction and the Ways of Coping Checklist (WCCL) to assess thoughts and behaviours related to coping strategies during stressful events. The exclusion criteria for the study included the following: 1) current pregnancy or breastfeeding; 2) severe suicidal tendency; 3) serious medical or neurological illness; 4) substance dependence including tobacco, alcohol, or other psychoactive substances; or 5) metallic implants or other contraindications to MRI. All study procedures were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles and approved by the local Institutional Review Boards of Hangzhou Normal University. All subjects provided written informed IRB-approved consent before participating in study procedures. \n\n\n### MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nAll MRI data were acquired on a 3.0 T Discovery MR 750 scanner (General Electric, Waukesha, WI, USA) at the Center for Cognition and Brain Disorders at Hangzhou Normal University. During the MRI scan, a comfortable and tight cushion was placed to immobilize the head and reduce motion. The participants were instructed to relax and remain still with their eyes close, not to fall asleep, and not to think about anything in particular. Functional images were obtained in an interleaved order using a T2*-weighted gradient-echo EPI pulse sequence. The acquisition parameters were as follows: TR/TE = 2000/22, flip angle = 77°, field of view = 240 × 240 mm , matrix = 96 × 96, 2.5 mm isotropic spatial resolution with 42 slices and 240 volumes. High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were also obtained in sagittal orientation for visualization and localization of the functional data with fast spoiled gradient echo sequence (3D FSPGR): TR/TE = 9/3.66, flip angle = 13°, field of view = 240 × 240 mm , matrix = 300 × 300, 0.8 mm isotropic voxels, 176 slices without interslice gap. \n\n\n### MRI Preprocessing \n  \nMRI data processing was performed using a combination of DPABI ( ), SPM ( ) and custom code written in MATLAB. After discarding the first 10 volumes for magnetization equilibration effects and the MRI environmental adaptation, the functional images were corrected for the time shifts among different acquisitions within each volume by sinc interpolating volume slices. Each volume was then realigned to the first volume to estimate motion parameters and correct for head motion. All participants had a maximum displacement of less than 2 mm in the x-, y-, or z-axes and an angular motion of less than 2 during the entire MRI scan. The corrected images were spatially normalized to the standard stereotactic space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) using the transformation derived from T1 segmentation and resampled to 3-mm isotropic voxels. The images generated were smoothed with a 6-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Finally, the images underwent temporal bandpass ﬁltering (between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz). \n\n\n### Entropy And Functional Connectivity Calculations \n  \nSample entropy measures the irregularity of a data series by computing the negative natural logarithm of an estimate of the conditional probability for that epochs of length that matches point-wise within a tolerance value that also matches at the next point. Brain entropy maps were generated on a voxel-by-voxel basis using the sample entropy approach  of the Brain Entropy Mapping Toolbox (BENtbx,  ). Based on previous optimal parameter values for R-fMRI data, ,  the window length (m) was set to 3, and the cut-off tolerance threshold (r) was set to 0.6 multiplied by the standard deviation of the data. In the present study, we computed brain entropy on a voxel-by-voxel basis in the whole brain and averaged brain entropy across all voxels within a given brain mask or ROI for between-group comparisons. We also analysed the relationship between the voxel-wise brain entropy and HDRS scores in the MDD group. \n\nFunctional connectivity was computed for each voxel according to a previous study.  The representative time courses of each individual ROI within the thalamus were extracted by averaging the R-fMRI time series over all voxels in that region, and the RSFC strengths were calculated between each subregion and other voxels in the whole brain using Pearson correlation of their R-fMRI time series.  The RSFC map was converted using Fisher’s r to z transformation to improve the Gaussian distribution for group level analyses. \n\n\n### Automated Functional Subdivision In The Thalamus \n  \nTo examine functional heterogeneity and homogeneity within the thalamus, we adopted the Louvain method  for network module detection based on graph theory  to automatically segment the thalamus into subregions. First, a thalamic mask was defined by the automated anatomical labelling (AAL) atlas bilaterally.  The R-fMRI time series of all voxels within the thalamic mask were extracted, and Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients were computed between all possible pairs of voxels to form a symmetric matrix. Second, the backbone of the group mean matrix was then constructed by applying a nonparametric method of locally adaptive network sparsiﬁcation,  and the module detection algorithm  was applied to the backbone to parcellate the whole thalamus into composite modules for further functional connectivity analysis. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nBetween-group differences in the entropy and RSFC values were conducted on a voxel-by-voxel basis in the whole brain using the two-sample   t  -test. A multiple comparison of Gaussian random field theory (GRF) was performed with voxel p < 0.005, and a GRF cluster-corrected threshold of p < 0.05. Given their ambiguous biological interpretations of negative RSFC, the between-group statistical comparisons were restricted to positive RSFC, and all negative ones were removed. Pearson’s correlation analysis between the entropy map and HDRS scores in the MDD group was performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis in the whole brain, and the statistical threshold at cluster p < 0.05 and correction threshold of multiple comparisons using GRF at voxel p < 0.005 were set. In addition, ROI analysis and between-group comparison for entropy data were also conducted based on the whole thalamus and seven masks derived from the aforementioned thalamic subdivision of the HC group. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Between-Group Differences In Resting-State Brain Entropy \n  \nCompared with healthy participants, MDD patients had significantly decreased brain entropy primarily in the bilateral thalami (peak MNI coordinates, left side at x = −18, y = −15, z = 12, t = −4.68, cluster size = 110 voxels; right side at x = 18, y = −15, z = 0, t = −4.62, cluster size = 76 voxels) extending to the bilateral insula, bilateral putamen, left caudate and right inferior frontal gyrus (p < 0.05, corrected;  ). The t-maps from the aforementioned between-group comparison were converted into a mask for computing the mean entropy. MDD patients had significantly decreased mean entropy than the controls (t = −5.67, p < 0.00001).   \nClusters showing brain entropy differences in MDD patients compared with HC. Significance level was defined at voxel p < 0.005, cluster p < 0.05, GRF corrected. L refers to the left side of the images in the coronal, and horizontal sections correspond to the left side of the brain. \n  \n\n\n### Correlations Between The Entropy Values And Clinical Features Of MDD \n  \nAs shown in  , there were significant negative correlations between the resting-state brain entropy and HDRS scores primarily in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG, correlation coefficient r at peak voxel peak was −0.58, MNI coordinates: x = −48, y = 15, z = −9, cluster size = 110 voxels), which extended to the left Rolandic operculum, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left insula (p < 0.05, corrected).   \nCorrelations between entropy and the Hamilton rating scale for MDD. Significance level was defined at voxel p < 0.005, cluster p < 0.05, GRF corrected. L refers to the left side of the images in the coronal, and horizontal sections correspond to the left side of the brain. \n  \n\n\n### Functional Parcellation Within The Thalamus \n  \nTo examine the subregional specificity within the whole thalamus, the module detection method  was used based on the R-fMRI voxel time series within the bilateral thalami. The modularity structure was observed in both groups (Q = 0.57 for the HC group and Q = 0.59 for the MDD group). Seven subregions (ROI) were detected in the HC group ( : ROI 1, red; ROI 2, green; ROI 3, blue; ROI 4, orange; ROI 5, cyan; ROI 6, yellow; ROI 7, magenta). In the MDD group, seven subregions were also detected ( : ROI 1, red; ROI 2, green; ROI 3, blue; ROI 4, orange; ROI 5, cyan; ROI 6, yellow; ROI 7, magenta). The subdivisions of the thalamus identified in the MDD and HC groups were very similar, and further entropy comparison and RSFC analysis were processed based on the ROI patterns of the thalamus in the HC group. As shown in  , MDD patients had signiﬁcantly decreased mean entropy compared with HC (two-sample   t  -test, ROI 1, t = −1.53, p=0.13; ROI 2, t = −2.27, p=0.03; ROI 3, t = −2.71, p=0.008; ROI 4, t = −1.48, p=0.14; ROI 5, t = −2.37, p=0.02; ROI 6, t = −3.63, p=0.00; ROI 7, t = −2.19, p = 0.03; the whole thalamus, t = −2.63, p=0.01).   \nThe thalamic subregions.

Compared with HC, MDD patients indicated signiﬁcantly increased RSFC between ROI 1 and the left medial part of the superior frontal gyrus (mSFG), which extended to the left inferior and middle prefrontal cortex, left anterior and middle cingulate cortex, and left precentral gyrus (p < 0.05, corrected;  ). The ROI 2 in MDD patients exhibited signiﬁcantly increased RSFC with the bilateral mSFG, which extended to the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, and putamen. We also observed that ROI 2 exhibited signiﬁcantly increased RSFC with the right insula, including the right caudate, right putamen, and right Rolandic operculum.

The results showed that decreased entropy in MDD was mainly located in anterior subregions of the thalamus. Automated functional subdivision in the whole thalamus was implemented based on R-fMRI data using a Louvain method for module detection. We subdivided the whole thalamus into seven subregions and identified distinct RSFC patterns. MDD patients showed that the brain entropy in the STG was correlated with the HDRS scores. \n\nThe thalamus is a central brain region that plays a crucial role in relaying and integrating information across neural systems underlying awareness and sensory, motor, and cognitive functions.  Reduced entropy in the thalamus implied that the dynamic activity of this region in MDD patients was organized towards a regular or single state. It may lead to insufficient types of brain activity patterns to meet diverse functional requirements and even a loss of flexibility in relaying various incoming and outgoing information to appropriate regions, which also implies that the thalamus is an important region for the neuropathology in MDD. This finding about the thalamus provides new evidence from the perspective of temporal brain activity dynamics that complements previous studies that have reported thalamic dysfunction in MDD. \n\nIn recent years, there has been growing particular interest in examining thalamic dysfunction with the delineation of thalamic parcellation and various RSFC patterns. , ,  The thalamus is a communication conduit between subcortical brain areas and the cerebral cortex, such as in the thalamo-cortical system. Previous research has shown that impaired thalamo-cortical processing is involved in MDD.  Our results of an abnormal enhancement of RSFC between the thalamus and mSFG suggested disturbances of MDD-related thalamo-cortical functional coupling. The results also demonstrated that the RSFC alterations with the mSFG in MDD were widely distributed across almost all thalamic subregions, suggesting a general involvement of the thalamic independent of the location and function of its subregions. \n\nMDD patients exhibited distinct RSFC patterns of thalamic subregions. ROI 5 showed signiﬁcantly increased RSFC, with peak differences in the STG and Heschl’s sulcus (also called the transverse temporal gyri), suggesting that abnormal RSFC between ROI 5 and the temporal lobe might play an important role in the pathophysiology of MDD. This postulation was consistent with previous MRI studies  and our clinical association analysis results between the brain entropy and HDRS scores. The STG plays a crucial role in the processing of emotional experiences and social cognition and has been repeatedly implicated in MDD.  For example, adolescents with a history of suicide attempt and treatment-resistant depression had decreased STG volume compared with HC. ROIs 5 and 7 showed signiﬁcantly increased RSFC with Rolandic operculum. The Rolandic operculum belongs to the auditory network and has been detected as a feature with discriminative power when classifying MDD patients from HC.  ROIs 2 and 7 showed signiﬁcantly increased RSFC with insula. Anatomically, the insula (often called the insular cortex) is part of the cerebral cortex folded deep within the lateral sulcus, which receives input from thalamic nuclei. The bilateral insular cortex is related to self-awareness and to the processing of emotional information, which are frequently affected in MDD.  Previous MRI studies have reported that the insula could be a key region associated with depression. ,  One possibility is that increased RSFC between the anterior thalamus and bilateral insula underlies emotion processing under MDD. ROIs 7 and 3 showed signiﬁcantly increased RSFC with the inferior orbital frontal gyrus. A previous study reported that cerebral glucose metabolism in the inferior orbital frontal gyrus of MDD patients was correlated with depressive symptoms. \n\nThalamus-related brain networks contain two components, i.e., regional neural properties and how the regional activities interact with others in the brain.  Decreased entropy in the thalamus showed abnormal local regional spontaneous neural activities in MDD, while increased thalamic RSFC with the mSFG and other cortical regions indicated disturbances of MDD-related thalamo-cortical functional coupling. MDD patients exhibited this reverse abnormal tendency between the two results, indicating a single state of regional activities in the thalamus was accompanied by an abnormal enhancement of RSFC with the cerebral cortex. \n\nThe present study has two limitations. First, the present study is preliminary. Further studies with a larger sample size are expected to confirm the reproducibility of these findings. Second, the coordination of cortical and thalamic activity plays a vital role in regulating the state of sleep and wakefulness. The present exploratory study showed brain entropy and thalamic functional connectivity during the eyes-closed resting-state scans, and the participants were instructed to remain still and not to fall asleep in scan. Further R-fMRI studies can benefit by optimizing the experimental design (e.g., including a sleep monitor). These data are preliminary and require replication with larger numbers of subjects. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOverall, our study demonstrated a resting-state brain entropy reduction in anterior subregions of the thalamus in MDD patients. Increased RSFC between the thalamus and mSFG were also found in MDD patients. The findings suggested entropy as a potential marker that represents a novel perspective on the temporal dynamics of functional brain activity and enhanced the understanding of the various pathophysiologic processes in MDD. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"40a37b4122684c7eeb9e4bb383757eee"},

Although abnormal functional connectivity associated with AVH has been reported in multiple regions, the changes in information flow remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate causal influences related to AVH in key regions of auditory, language, and memory networks, by using Granger causality analysis (GCA). \n\n\n## Patients and Methods \n  \nEighteen patients with schizophrenia with AVH and eighteen matched patients without AVH who received resting-state fMRI scans were enrolled in the study.

Correlation analysis showed that the normalized GC ratios from the left STG to Broca’s area, from the left STG to the right homolog of Broca’s area, and from the right STG to the right homolog of Broca’s area were negatively correlated with severity of AVH, and the normalized GC ratios from Broca’s area to the left hippocampus and from Broca’s area to the right STG were positively correlated with severity of AVH. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur findings indicate a causal influence of pivotal regions involving the auditory, language, and memory networks in schizophrenia with AVH, which provide a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying AVH. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAuditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are the most prominent and burdensome symptoms of schizophrenia, and comprise sensory experiences wherein voices are heard without a causative external stimulus. The prevalence of AVH exceeds 60% in patients with schizophrenia worldwide ( ,  ). In 30% of patients with AVH, the hallucinations are not affected by clinical treatments ( ), and cause functional disability and therefore lower quality of life. Clinical options to treat such patients are currently limited. Since the neurobiological mechanisms involved in AVH remain unclear; insights into the pathophysiology of AVH could facilitate the development of novel strategies to treat patients who do not respond to currently used medications. \n\nThe mechanism by which AVH occurs spontaneously from the brain’s intrinsic activity is of great clinical interest. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can show spontaneous brain activity   in vivo  , and can therefore provide invaluable insights into the psychopathology of AVH. Based on time series derived from resting state fMRI data, functional connectivity (FC) analysis can be used to calculate the temporal correlations between a blood-oxygenation-level dependent in any two regions, offering an effective method to study alterations in brain connectivity within multiple brain networks associated with AVH in schizophrenia. \n\nIn previous models including the “memory intrusion”, “self-monitoring”, “two hit bottom-up and top-down”, and hybrid models, language, auditory, and memory brain networks were closely associated with AVH in patients with schizophrenia ( ). The superior temporal gyrus (STG) (auditory cortex), Broca’s area (speech production), Wernicke’s area (language comprehension), hippocampus (memory retrieval), and putamen (initiating language representations) are the key areas responsible for AVH in schizophrenia, and showed functional alterations in previous brain imaging studies ( – ). Although aberrant FC associated with AVH has been reported in these regions in many resting-state fMRI studies ( ,  ,  ,  ,  – ), the interactions between these regions have not been described completely. Furthermore, the information flow within these networks has not been completely characterized. \n\nEffective connectivity (EC) analyses using data on time-lagged relationships between cerebral regions, offers additional information on the directionality of information flow within brain networks ( ,  ). Granger causality analysis (GCA) is a special method used to study EC, and could yield deductive networks based on hypothetical seed regions without prior knowledge. This model is simple, has low computational complexity, and is not limited by the number of brain regions studied. It is therefore an efficient and convenient method for analyzing fMRI data on resting-state functional organization in various healthy and diseased brain networks ( – ). To our knowledge, this method has not been used to study the information flow within the aforementioned regions in resting-state fMRI studies. \n\nIn this study, we used the GCA method on resting-state fMRI data to determine the patterns of effective connections between the bilateral STG, Broca’s area, Wernicke’s area, hippocampus, and putamen in schizophrenia patients with and without AVH, in order to obtain novel imaging evidence for the elucidation of the neural mechanisms underlying AVH. We first used GCA to study the differences in effective connections between schizophrenia patients with and without AVH to determine the direction of connection changes. We then performed correlation analysis between changes in causal influence and severity of hallucination symptoms to identify the functional disturbances caused by AVH. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThis study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shaanxi Provincial People’s Hospital, and written parental consent was obtained from all participants. \n\nStudy participants were recruited from the in-patient ward, and met the following criteria: 1) diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder by using the Structured Clinical Interview of the DSM-IV (SCID); 2) with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) assessment; 3) Han Chinese in origin; 4) right-handed; 5) between 18 and 40 years old; 6) received conventional MRI and resting-state fMRI scans with available images. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) history of other psychotic disorders; 2) substance abuse or dependence; 3) severe medical disorders; 4) traumatic brain injury; 5) electroconvulsive therapy within the past 6 months; 6) intellectual disability or neurological impairment. Patients who presented with AVHs at least once a day for the past four weeks, with a PANSS P3 score ≥4 were assigned to the AVH group, and patients who did not experience hallucinations or had a P3 score of ≤3 belonged to the non-AVH group ( ,  ). \n\nAll clinical data were double reviewed by a senior researcher, who verified the credibility of the patient statements. Information of usage of antipsychotics (name, dosage, and duration of drugs used before MRI scanning) was also collected, and the converted antipsychotic doses to chlorpromazine (CPZ) milligram equivalent units were calculated. No significant correlation was found between granger causality (GC) and illness duration or CPZ equivalent in either AVH group or non-AVH group; thus, they were not taken as covariates in further statistics. \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nAll MRI data were performed within 3 days after the PANSS. Conventional MRI and resting-state fMRI were acquired on a 3.0T scanner (Signa HDxt, General Electric Medical System, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an eight-channel phase array radio-frequency head coil. Head motion was minimized by positioned with restraining foam pads. Earplugs were used to decrease the effects of scanner noise. The total scan time was <20 min. Three-dimensional fast-spoiled gradient-recalled echo T1-weighted images (repetition time/echo time, 10/4.6–14 ms) and fast-spin echo T2-weighted images (repetition time/echo time, 4,200/116.4–124.0 ms) were obtained. Before fMRI scanning, the patients were instructed to stay awake, relax, keep their eyes closed, and refrain from moving. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI was acquired using the following parameters: 185 volumes, echo time = 30 ms, repetition time = 2000 ms, flip angle = 90°, 40 axial slices, slice thickness = 4 mm; field of view, 240 × 240 mm ; matrix = 64×64. The acquisition time was 6 min and 30 s. \n\n\n### Data Preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing of fMRI data was performed using SPM12 software ( ). Functional images were subjected to slice-timing correction and were then realigned to the first volume to correct for head motions. The data with head movement > 1.5 mm and/or rotation angle >1.5° were excluded. The realigned images were then spatially normalized to the MNI EPI template and resampled to a voxel size of 3 × 3 × 3 mm . A band-pass filter between 0.01 and 0.08 Hz was subsequently applied to the data to remove the effects of very-low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise. Finally, spatial smoothing was applied using a 6-mm full-width-at-half-maximum Gaussian kernel. The head-motion parameters, white-matter signals, and cerebrospinal-fluid-signals were regressed out of the BOLD signals. \n\n\n### Regions of Interest (ROIs) Selection \n  \nThe bilateral STG, Broca’s area, Wernicke’s area, putamen, and hippocampus were selected as the ROIs. Masks representing each of the ROIs were created by using the Wake Forest University PickAtlas tool with TD-ICBM Human Atlas (TD Brodmann) ( ). The fMRI time courses of all the voxels located within the masks for each ROI were extracted. \n\n\n### Granger Causality Analysis \n  \nGCA was performed using REST-GCA software ( ). By applying an order 2 vector auto-regression model, for any two ROI time series x(t) and y(t), the time domain pairwise GCA components from x(t) to y(t) (F ) and from y(t) to x(t) (F ) were calculated respectively. Pairwise Granger causal connectivity indicates that neuronal activity of one region is predictive of activity occurring in another region. Causal influence was normalized using the following computing method ( ): \n\nR  is the ratio describing the relative strength and directionality of the causal influences between x and y. A positive R  with a larger absolute value indicates stronger causal influence from x to y, while a negative R  with a larger absolute value denotes stronger causal influence from y to x. Changes in R  were calculated by analyzing the differences between the AVH and non-AVH groups. \n\n\n### Correlation Analysis \n  \nThe association between changes in causal influence and hallucination were assessed using correlation analyses performed between the normalized R  ratios of the pairwise ROIs and the PANSS P3 score. The Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple comparisons, and   P   < 0.005 (0.05/10) was considered statistically significant. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nStatistical analysis was performed on SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The measurement data of normal distribution were presented as means ± standard deviations, and categorical data as frequencies and percentages. The two sample   t  -test or χ  test, were used to compare demographic and clinical data between the AVH and non-AVH groups. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and   P   ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThis study included 18 patients with AVH and 18 without AVH. The AVH and non-AVH groups did not show signiﬁcant differences in age, gender, education, smoking, drinking, illness duration, proportion of first episode patients, CPZ equivalent dose, total, negative and general symptom severity PANSS score. Positive PANSS score and PANSS P3 score were significantly higher in the AVH group than in the non-AVH group ( ). \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of AVH and non-AVH groups. \n  \nAVH, auditory verbal hallucinations; PANSS, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; CPZ, chlorpromazine. \n  \n\n### GCA Results \n  \nCompared with the non-AVH group, AVH group showed an increase in GC from the right homolog of Broca’s area to the left STG, and a decrease from the right STG to the right hippocampus, from the left putamen to the right hippocampus, from the right putamen to the right hippocampus, and from the right putamen to Broca’s area (  and  ). \n  \nComparisons of the pairwise GC values (F ) between AVH and non-AVH groups. \n  \nL, left; R, right; *P < 0.05. \n\nGC, granger causality; AVH, auditory verbal hallucinations; Hipp, hippocampus; STG, superior temporal gyrus. \n    \nComparisons of the pairwise GC values (F ) between AVH and non-AVH groups. \n  \nL, left; R, right; *P < 0.05. \n\nGC, granger causality; AVH, auditory verbal hallucinations; Hipp, hippocampus; STG, superior temporal gyrus; Broca, Broca’s area. \n  \nThe normalized ratios of GC from the left STG to Broca’s area and its right homolog, from the right STG to the right homolog of Broca’s area, and from the right STG to the right hippocampus were significantly lower in the AVH group than in the non-AVH group. The bi-directional causal values (F  and F ) explained the results caused by increased GC from Broca’s area and its right homolog to the left STG and from the right homolog of Broca’s area to the right STG, and the decreased GC from the right STG to the right hippocampus (  and  ). \n  \nComparisons of the pairwise normalized ratios of GC values (R ) between AVH and non-AVH groups. \n  \nL, left; R, right; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.001. \n\nGC, granger causality; AVH, auditory verbal hallucinations; Hipp, hippocampus; STG, superior temporal gyrus; Broca, Broca’s area; Wernicke, Wernicke’s area. \n    \nThe pairwise normalized ratios of GC values (R ) in AVH and non-AVH groups.

The different color of lines corresponded to different brain regions. \n  \nThe normalized ratios of Granger causality from the right homolog of Broca’s area to the right homolog of Wernicke’s area, from Broca’s area to the left hippocampus, and from Broca’s area to the STG were significantly increased in the AVH group (  and  ). Bi-directional causal values (F  and F ), indicated that these differences were mainly due to the decreased Granger causality from the right homolog of Wernicke’s area to the right homolog of Broca’s area and from the left hippocampus to Broca’s area, and increased Granger causality from Broca’s area to the STG (  and  ). \n\n\n### Correlation Analysis \n  \nThe normalized ratios of Granger causality from the left STG to Broca’s area, from the left STG to the right homolog of Broca’s area, and from the right STG to the right homolog of Broca’s area were negatively correlated with PANSS P3 score, and the normalized ratios of Granger causality from Broca’s area to the left hippocampus and from Broca’s area to the right STG were positively correlated with PANSS P3 score ( ). However, after the Bonferroni correction, statistically significant correlations were only observed between normalized ratios of Granger causality from the right STG to the right homolog of Broca’s area and from Broca’s area to the right STG and PANSS P3 score. \n  \nCorrelations between pairwise normalized ratios of GC values and PANSS P3 score. \n  \nL, left; R, right; *P < 0.05;  P < 0.005. \n\nGC, granger causality; PANSS, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; Hipp, hippocampus; STG, superior temporal gyrus; Broca, Broca’s area; Wernicke, Wernicke’s area. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nGCA, an effective connection analysis method, is used to examine the directional interaction and influence between brain regions by calculating the information between two time series. In recent years, GCA has been widely applied in the field of neurocognitive science. Studying alterations in interactive causal influences (driving forces) in brain regions involved in schizophrenia-related hallucinations could improve our understanding of the underlying neurobiological substrates. In this study, we found significant differences in effective connections related to auditory, speech, and memory circuits, involving the STG, Wernicke’s area, Broca’s area, and hippocampus, in schizophrenia patients with and without AVH by using GCA. These abnormal functional connections could contribute causally to the onset of auditory hallucinations. \n\n### The Auditory Processing Circuit \n  \nThe STG contains the auditory cortex, which is responsible for the perception and processing of sounds. Broca’s area is closely associated with the auditory cortex. Previous resting state fMRI studies suggested that abnormal connectivity between Broca’s area and the auditory cortex could be responsible for AVH ( ,  ,  ). However, evidence of resting connectivity between these two areas is unclear. Sommer et al. ( ) reported reduced synchronization between the left STG and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, close to Broca’s area) in patients with chronic AVH ( ). Hoffman et al. ( ) studied the time course of AVH and FC at the various stages of hallucinations ( ), and found an increased coupling just prior to hallucinations between the left IFG and right temporal areas (including the STG and middle temporal gyrus). Diederen et al. ( ) also observed elevated connectivity between the left STG and right IFG ( ). Thus, the change in connection strength in the two regions is not clear, and possibly not uniform in all patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the directionality of abnormal connections related to auditory and language processing regions remains unclear. \n\nOur results from the GCA provide information on the direction of the effective connection between the STG and Broca’s area. We observed increased Granger causality from Broca’s area and Broca’s homolog to the bilateral STG in the AVH group, which was also associated with severity of hallucination. To date, only Baojuan et al. ( ) have studied the interaction between the auditory cortex and Broca’s area in a dynamic causal model. They reported that a positive correlation was observed between the strength of EC from Broca’s area to the auditory cortex and AVH severity, which is consistent with our results. The increased effective connection from the auditory cortex to Broca’s area was likely a compensatory change due to the decreased connection from Wernicke’s area to Broca’s area ( ), which was also verified in our study. In addition, we hypothesize that AVHs are derived from auditory cortical activity, and spontaneous activity is very likely caused by the intrusion of internal auditory signals from Broca’s area. \n\n\n### The Speech Processing Circuit \n  \nOur results showed decreased Granger causality from the right homolog of Wernicke’s area to the right homolog of Broca’s area. Broca’s area is involved in the production of language, and Wernicke’s area is involved in the comprehension of written and spoken language. Although the left hemisphere is widely considered the site of speech processing, studies in patients who suffered strokes indicate that the right hemisphere is also capable of basic language production ( ,  ). Further studies indicated that the right homologs of Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas have prominent roles in the processing of emotional information and spoken language tone ( ,  ). Our results also clearly indicated functional disturbance in speech processing circuits in patients with AVHs. \n\nFunctional alterations in Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas in patients with schizophrenia who experience AVHs have been widely reported in fMRI studies ( ). However, there have been few reports of abnormal resting FC between these areas, and most results have been inconsistent. Vercammen et al. reported reduced FC between the left temporal-parietal junction and the right homolog of Broca’s area in schizophrenia patients with AVH. However, patients without AVH were not studied, and symptom correlations for hallucination severity were not presented ( ). Hoffman et al. found greater FC between the bilateral Wernicke’s area and Brodmann area 45/46 of IFG (Broca’s area) in patients with AVH compared to patients without AVH ( ); follow-up analysis indicated greater FC along a loop linking Wernicke’s area, the IFG, and the putamen compared with patients without AVH and healthy controls. In addition, structural connectivity in the left arcuate fasciculus, which connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas, was lower in patients with schizophrenia with AVH than in patients with non-AVH schizophrenia and healthy controls ( – ). These results also suggested disrupted functional interactions within speech-processing systems. \n\nAVH have been linked to several cognitive mechanisms, including misattribution or impaired self-monitoring during speech generation, which could be due to disrupted connectivity between frontal and temporo-parietal brain regions ( ). Misattribution models of AVH posit that auditory hallucination experiences occur because of failure to monitor internal speech and attributing it to an external source ( ,  ), and therefore predict abnormal FC between typical speech processing areas, mainly in the left fronto-temporal network (including Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas), possibly extending to right hemisphere language homolog areas ( ). The delayed “corollary discharge” theory ( ,  ) proposes that the failure of neural signal transmission between temporal speech perception areas and inferior frontal speech production areas cause precognition disability in inner speech generation, and temporal speech perception areas cannot suppress response intensity in auditory perception areas, which subsequently incorrectly identify inner speech as external speech. However, the directional information of the connection between Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas is not described clearly. \n\nĆurčić-Blake et al. ( ) primarily investigated EC in the language circuitry by using dynamic causal modeling in schizophrenia patients with and without AVH in an inner speech task. Their results showed diminished connectivity from Wernicke’s area to Broca’s area and a decreasing trend in connectivity from homologs of Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas to Broca’s area. Our results were obtained in a resting state by using GCA, but also suggested reduced information transmission from temporal to frontal language areas in schizophrenia AVH patients. Thus, neuronal activity of frontal language areas was less restrained by temporal language areas, leading to diminished self-monitoring and subsequent misperception of internal speech. These findings add to the aforementioned theoretical models from the perspective of information flow. However, similar research methods and results have not been reported and the connection changes in language processing mode underlying AVH have not been fully characterized. Further studies to verify these preliminary findings should be conducted. \n\n\n### The Memory Circuit \n  \nIncreased GC from the left hippocampus to left Broca’s area and decreased GC from the right STG to the right hippocampus were observed in this study. The hippocampus is associated with complex memories in humans, and may be a temporary storage site for memories ( ). Hippocampal damage was associated with the occurrence of auditory hallucinations in animal models of schizophrenia ( ). Several neuroimaging studies have suggested that the hippocampus is involved in auditory hallucinations. Amad et al. ( ) showed that functional connections, white matter connections, and hippocampal volume changes were associated with auditory hallucinations. A meta-analysis based on “activation study” demonstrated increased activity in the left hippocampus/parahippocampal region during AVH in patients with schizophrenia ( ). This region also connects widely distributed association cortices, including the language areas responsible for hallucinatory experiences. The hippocampus/parahippocampal region could therefore trigger auditory hallucination-related language brain areas, as our findings also suggest. \n\nBased on a resting-state study, some researchers ( ) found reduced FC between the left STG and left hippocampus in patients with chronic schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations compared to patients with non-auditory hallucination, which was negatively correlated with the severity of AVH. Baojuan et al. ( ) reported a weakened effective connection from the auditory cortex to the hippocampus in patients with schizophrenia with AVH, by using the dynamic causal model, which was consistent with the results of this study. Although no projection fibers have been found between the auditory cortex and hippocampus anatomically, the results of this study and previous studies all suggest that there might be functional interactions between the two regions. However, there is still no clear understanding of how the reduction of the auditory cortical-hippocampal connection is related with the occurrence of auditory hallucinations. Baojuan et al. ( ) speculated that since there are long longitudinal fibers (inferior longitudinal fasciculus) linking the visual region and the hippocampus ( ), there might be a similar “auditory cortical-hippocampal projection” participating in the processing of auditory information. We hypothesized that reduced auditory cortical-hippocampal connectivity may lead to aberrant memory retrieval, which is regulated by the hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus, subsequently triggering memory pieces stored in subcortical regions, especially those related to language, thereby causing the appearance of unconscious auditory hallucinations. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThere were some limitations associated with this study. First, the sample size was small, and the study only included patients from one hospital, which might limit the scope and statistical power of our findings. Second, ROI selection was mainly based on previous literature researches, which were frequently reported regions associated with auditory hallucinations. However, several other regions associated with auditory hallucination, but with no clear consensus, were not included, which might limit the exploration of alterations in effective connections. Third, GCA ignores the influence of neurohemodynamics, which may cause displacement distortion and therefore false causality. The dynamic causal model can quantify changes of the effective connection at the neuron level, which can make up for the defects of the Granger causality model but is directly affected by the accuracy of selected ROIs. Therefore, combining data-driven and model-driven analysis by using these two effective connection methods could provide more accurate results and is a promising avenue for future research. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this effective connection study based on GCA, we found abnormal connections in specific directions involving the auditory cortex, auditory language formation regions, and hippocampus in schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations, which may explain the mechanism of auditory hallucination from insights of auditory processing, origin of internal speech and memory. These results also provide new imaging evidences in related neural mechanisms of auditory hallucinations from the direction of the information flow. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Shaanxi Provincial People’s Hospital.

Given the nature of neurodegeneration in AD progression, observing longitudinal changes in the structural features of brain networks over time may improve the accuracy of the predicted transformation and provide a good measure of the progression of AD. Currently, there is no cure for patients with existing AD dementia, but patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the prodromal stage of AD dementia may be diagnosed. The study of the early diagnosis of MCI and the prediction of MCI to AD transformation is of great significance for the monitoring of the MCI to AD transformation process. Despite the high rate of MCI conversion to AD, the neuropathological cause of MCI is heterogeneous. However, many people with MCI remain stable. Treatment options are different for patients with stable MCI and those with underlying dementia. Therefore, it is of great significance for clinical practice to predict whether patients with MCI will develop AD dementia. This paper proposes an improved algorithm that is based on a convolution neural network (CNN) with residuals combined with multi-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) to diagnose AD and predict MCI. Firstly, multi-time resting-state fMRI images were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for preprocessing, and then an AAL brain partition template was used to construct a 90 × 90 functional connectivity (FC) network matrix of a whole-brain region of interest (ROI). Secondly, the diversity of training samples was increased by generating an adversarial network (GAN). Finally, a CNN with residuals and a multi-layer LSTM model were constructed to automatically classify and predict the functional adjacency matrix. This method can not only distinguish Alzheimer’s disease from normal health conditions at multiple time points, but can also predict progressive MCI (pMCI) and stable MCI (sMCI) at multiple time points. The classification accuracies in AD vs. NC and sMCI vs.pMCI reached 93.5% and 75.5%, respectively. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common, non-reversible, and progressive neurological disease characterized by cognitive impairment, with patients’ memory and thinking abilities gradually becoming impaired over time [ ]. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between normal aging and AD and is characterized by mild memory and intellectual impairment, with a degree of memory impairment not commensurate with age [ ]. MCI is a preclinical risk factor for AD. The conversion of MCI to AD is ten times more common than in the general population. According to follow-up studies, the incidence of transition to AD in patients with MCI is 10 to 15% within 1 year, 40% within 2 years, and 20 to 53% within 3 years [ ]. Therefore, MCI patients can be further divided into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) patients. Although there is no treatment for MCI and AD patients at present, the study on the early diagnosis of MCI and the prediction of MCI to AD transformation is of great significance for the monitoring of the MCI to AD transformation process [ ].Research on the diagnosis of AD and the prediction of the MCI–AD transformation process has become a hotspot for current scholars. With the development of medical neuroimaging technology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has provided more effective data support for related scholars to study AD due to its safety, non-invasiveness, high pixel resolution, and flexible imaging methods [ ]. In the research on AD and the prediction of the MCI–AD transformation process based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data, the most common method used is to abstract the pictorial data into numerical data and construct functional brain adjacency networks. The study of the differences in functional brain adjacency networks between subjects with AD and normal subjects, as well as between subjects with sMCI and pMCI, has become a hot topic in recent years. As a potential biomarker, the functional connectivity (FC) matrix has attracted much attention in many studies [ ]. In recent years, strategies for dementia diagnosis based on deep learning methods have achieved good results over traditional machine learning methods because deep learning models can extract the differential feature representation hierarchically and can naturally combine features of different levels together [ ]. Most domestic and foreign research is based on deep learning for horizontal classification diagnosis, such as normal control groups (NC) and AD dichotomies or NC, MCI, and AD tri-classification studies [ ]. Zhang et al. [ ] studied the functional connectivity of the whole brain by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficients based on rs-fMRI data and proposed a set of novel features by applying the two-sample   t  -test on the correlation coefficients’ matrix to identify the most discriminative correlation coefficients. Taie et al. [ ] proposed a bat-based support vector machine (SVM) parameter optimization model for the diagnosis of AD in MRI bio-medical images. The model uses MRI to classify biomedical images and diagnose three kinds of biomedical images: NC, MCI, and AD. Xu et al. [ ] proposed a new deep learning method called the multiple graph Gaussian embedding model (MG2G), which maps high-dimensional resting-state brain networks to low-dimensional latent spaces to learn information-rich network features. This model predicts the progression to AD in patients with MCI and identifies altered areas of the brain network associated with MCI. According to research, the essence of AD deterioration is the degeneration of brain nerve function. Therefore, by observing and recording the longitudinal changes of brain functional links over time, one can detect AD in advance and take timely intervention measures to prevent the occurrence of AD or slow down the rate of neurodegeneration. In the longitudinal study, data collected at multiple time points will be involved [ ]. Longitudinal data capture the progression of disease dynamics as opposed to data at a single point in time. In this paper, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recursive neural networks (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) are introduced into the whole-brain functional networks analysis. A longitudinal joint analysis method of brain functional networks based on deep learning is proposed. In this method, rs-fMRI images of NC, sMCI, pMCI, and AD at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months were screened from the ADNI database to construct and analyze the brain functional networks [ ]. During the progression from MCI to AD, the connectivity patterns between brain regions change, and the information transmission ability and efficiency of the brain’s functional networks are impaired. In this paper, the whole-brain fMRI functional network connection was selected as a marker to carry out the study [ ]. The connection characteristics of the whole-brain functional networks were extracted and combined with the longitudinal characteristics to classify NC and AD and predict whether MCI patients were developing AD [ ]. The proposed method was validated in ADNI data sets and compared with other classical methods. The results show that the proposed method has a higher classification and prediction accuracy and stronger robustness than traditional methods. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Data Selection \n  \nThe sample data used in this study were from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) ( , accessed on 12 January 2022). There were 312 subjects in this study, including 100 for NC, 75 for sMCI, 72 for pMCI, and 65 for AD. fMRI images were collected at baseline (BL), 12 months, and 24 months in each group. Prior to the scan, the subjects passed cognitive and behavioral assessments [ ]. Sample demographic information is shown in  . \n\nAs can be seen from  , with the aggravation of the disease, MMSE scores showed a downward trend, while CDR showed an upward trend. A statistical analysis of basic information was obtained by SPSS software [ ]. Sample scanners selected from the ADNI are from Philips Medical Systems. The resting state fMRI scan sequence (EPI) has a total of 140 time points with 48 layers, a magnetic field intensity of 3.0 tesla, a flip angle of 80.0, a TE of 30.0 ms, a TR of 3000.0 ms, a 64 × 65 matrix, and 6720.0 images with a thickness of 3.31 mm. The resting-state fMRI image display of NC, AD, sMCI, and pMCI subjects is shown in  . \n\n\n### 2.2. Image Preprocessing \n  \nThe process of fMRI data preprocessing includes data format conversion, the removal of unstable time points, time layer correction, head movement correction, spatial standardization, the removal of linear drift, filtering, regression covariates, and the removal of excessive head movement time points [ ]. In this paper, the preprocessing process is basically the same as that of general MRI, but the difference is that the preprocessing in this paper does not need to be performed smoothly because network analysis requires high spatial accuracy, and smoothness will affect the activation of adjacent regions of interest (ROIs). The pretreatment process of fMRI data includes format conversion (DICOM format to NIFTI), the removal of the first ten unstable time points, time layer correction, head correction, spatial standardization, linear drift removal, filtering, regression covariates, and the removal of excessive head movement time points (in order to reduce the influence of head movements and artifacts, subjects with FD > 0.5 over 2.5 min (50 frames) of data were excluded). The SPM8 toolbox and the DPARSFA (version 2.2) toolkit were used for standard preprocessing [ , ]. The pretreatment flow chart is shown in  . \n\n\n### 2.3. Whole-Brain Functional Link Matrix FC \n  \nThe functional connectivity of the human brain is complex, and the connectivity of functional brain networks has been widely used in the study of AD. The construction of brain functional networks based on fMRI data was mainly divided into the following steps [ , ]: \n\n(1) Nodes (brain regions) were obtained, and the whole brain was divided into 90 ROI brain regions using the AAL (AAL90) template. Once the partitioning method was selected, the node was identified. \n\n(2) The whole-brain functional connectivity matrix was obtained using fMRI data and nodes. We averaged the voxels in each ROI brain region, obtained fMRI time series signals in each ROI brain region, and constructed the brain functional network of each subject by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between two ROIs. The Pearson correlation coefficients of the two time series are shown in Equation (1): \n\nThis is the product of the covariance of the two time series divided by the standard deviation of the two time series. The results of the Pearson correlation coefficient   are in the range of  . When  , the two time series are positively correlated or they are negatively correlated. When it equals zero, it means that the two time series are independent of each other and have no correlation. From this, it can be concluded that the functions of two groups of brain areas in a certain period of time are synergistic or antagonistic. By calculating the average time series of each brain region and calculating the correlation coefficient in pairs, the correlation matrix of the whole brain during this period of time can be obtained, namely the functional connection matrix [ , , ]. The functional connectivity matrix is displayed using the AAL90 template with a total of 90 brain regions, so the connectivity matrix is 90 × 90. Brain network visualization and the functional connection matrix are shown in  . \n\n\n### 2.4. The Improved Method Proposed in This Paper \n  \nAt present, common brain image analysis methods to manually extract the specified features are mainly based on prior knowledge, which results in great limitations in the representation of image features. Most brain image analysis studies are focused on image data analysis at a single time point, which is prone to interference from different individuals. Longitudinal image data analysis at multiple time points in the time domain can obtain pathological changes in the pathogenesis process and achieve a more precise diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease [ ]. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes an automatic analysis and diagnosis model of the multi-temporal brain function network based on the deep learning method. The functional connectivity (FC) (90 × 90) between brain ROI regions was used as the original input feature of CNNs. As deep neural networks generally require a large amount of training data to obtain ideal results, in the case of limited data in this paper, it is necessary to build a GAN to perform data augmentation for samples [ ]. Then, a 1D−CNN model was built to extract spatial features. Then, a three-layer LSTM model was built to extract and analyze FC features at multiple time points [ , ]. Finally, the validity of the model was verified against the ADNI data set. \n  \nGAN based data augmentation \n  \nThe GAN model contains two networks: one is a generative network, and the other is an adversarial network. The role of the generative network is to generate new samples in the case of given samples, so that the adversarial network cannot distinguish between these new samples and given samples. Therefore, GAN is generally a model that can generate synthetic samples that can reflect the target distribution behind real data and achieve the purpose of data augmentation [ ]. The principal diagram of data augmentation by GAN is shown in  . \n  \nSpatial feature extraction based on CNNs \n  \nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) are very similar to common neural networks in that they are both made up of neurons with learnable weights and biases. Every neuron takes some input and generates some dot products, and the output is the fraction of each classification [ ]. The function of the convolution layer is feature extraction. For the brain’s functional network at each time point, we built a 1D-CNN model with the same structure to extract spatial features at a single time point [ ]. The model structure is shown in  . \n\nThe model includes operations, such as convolution, max-pooling, and short connection structure. In this paper, the traditional CNN model with a single direction and vertical structure is improved. In the improved model, two short connection modules are added to fuse the features of the front and rear layers and enhance the utilization of the front layer [ ]. \n  \nRNN \n  \nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved great success and are widely used in many natural language processing (NLP) applications. RNNs are mainly used to process sequence data. A simple RNN consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer [ ]. The RNN can be expanded using a timeline, as shown in  . \n\nIn  , there is a one-way flow of information from the input unit to the hidden unit, and another one-way flow of information from the hidden unit to the output unit. In some cases, the RNNs break the latter restriction, guiding information from the output unit back to the hiding element. These are called “back projections,” and the input to the hiding layer also includes the status of the upper hiding layer, where nodes can be self-connected or interconnected [ ]. \n\nIn  , after the network receives the input   at time   t  , the value of the hidden layer is   and the output value is  . The key point is that the value of   not only depends on  , it depends on  . The calculation method of recurrent neural networks can be expressed as shown in Equations (2) and (3): \n\nIt can be seen from Equations (2) and (3) that the difference between the cyclic layer and the fully connected layer is that the cyclic layer has a weight matrix W. If Equation (3) is repeatedly substituted into Equation (2), Equation (4) will be obtained: \n\nRNNs have problems with gradient disappearance and gradient explosion in the process of long sequence training, i.e., information loss caused by long-distance transmission. \n  \nLSTM \n  \nThe long memory network (LSTM) successfully solved the defects of the original recurrent neural network and became the most popular RNN at present. It has been successfully applied in many fields, such as speech recognition, image description, and natural language processing. The hidden layer of the original RNN has only one state, H, which is very sensitive to short-term input. Thus, let us add another state C, to preserve the long-term state [ ]. This is shown in  : \n\nThe forgetting gate is shown in Equation (5): \n\n an be written as Equation (6): \n\nThe input gate is shown in Equation (7): \n\nIn the above formula,   is the weight matrix of the input gate, and   is the bias term of the input gate [ , ]. \n\nNext, the cell state   used to describe the current input is calculated based on the previous output, and the current input is shown in Equation (8): \n\nThis equation calculates the cell state   at the current time. It is produced by multiplying the element of the last cell state   by the forgetting gate  , and then multiplying the element of the current input cell state   by the input gate  , and then adding the two products shown in Equations (9) and (10): \n\nThe final output of LSTM is determined by the output gate and cell state shown in Equation (11): \n\n shows the calculation of the final output of LSTM: \n\nIn this paper, we set up a three-layer LSTM model to analyze these sequences and extract the temporal variation characteristics of the spatial features at different time points, so as to make comprehensive use of single-time point and multi-time point information to diagnose and predict AD [ , ]. The design of a CNN combined with the three-layer LSTM framework is shown in  . \n\nThe overall framework for AD diagnosis and MCI prediction is shown in  . \n\nThe overall program flow chart of this model is shown in  . \n\n\n\n## 3. Experimental Result \n  \nAfter the format conversion and image preprocessing of the original fMRI data obtained from ADNI in the experiment, the CNN model and LSTM model in this algorithm were built in the Python environment with the help of the deep learning library Keras and TensorFlow. The hardware configuration of this experiment is as follows: 8-core, 16-thread, AMD R7-4800U CPU, 16 G memory, 512 G hard disk, and a 4.2 GHz acceleration frequency. We performed an experimental test of the proposed multi-time resting-state fMRI brain functional network study on the ADNI database. We divided the whole data set into five parts, selected four pieces at a time as the training set, with the remaining one as the test set, and randomly selected part of the training set as the verification set. We used the accuracy, precision, and recall rate to evaluate the effect of this classification. The accuracy, precision, and recall rate are shown as Equation (12), Equation (13), and Equation (14), respectively.\n \nwhere   TP   means the prediction is positive, and the reality is positive; \n\n TN   means the prediction is negative, and the reality is negative; \n\n FP   means the prediction is positive, and the reality is negative; and \n\n FN   means the prediction is negative, and the reality is positive. \n\nThe loss curve is shown in  , and the experimental results based on the convolutional neural network and resting state fMRI brain functional network are shown in  . The blue line represents the loss curve of the training set, and the orange line represents the loss curve of the validation set. \n\nIn this study, the accuracy, precision, and recall of sMCI and pMCI as well as NC and AD groups at the baseline period (BL) and 12 months (12 m) and 24 months (24 m) after the baseline period were compared. As can be seen from the experimental results, there are significant differences between sMCI and pMCI as well as NC and AD samples over time. A comparison of the ROC curves of different algorithms is shown in  . \n\n\n## 4. Conclusions \n  \nIn this paper, we proposed a multi-time model for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease based on a convolutional neural network and a resting-state fMRI of the brain functional network. The ADNI dataset was used to screen the original fMRI data, and the whole-brain resting-state fMRI of the brain functional network was built after format conversion and image preprocessing. GAN was used to amplify the data as the initial feature of CNN + LSTM, and the model was verified at multiple time points. Compared with other classical algorithms, the experimental results show that the algorithm is effective. AD vs. NC was superior to pMCI vs. sMCI at multiple time points. The diagnosis effect of Alzheimer’s disease using only the SVM model was the worst, and the classification effect of the CNN experiment using only CNN was better than that of SVM at multiple time points. The model based on CNN combined with LSTM proposed by us was superior to the CNN and SVM methods alone in temporal and spatial analyses. This indicates that the spatial and temporal analysis algorithm proposed by us is suitable for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"72f7bde835bce7b2cabe91899219f874"},

However, a noninvasive approach to accurately and comprehensively delineate individual‐specific functional networks in the whole brain, especially in brain tissues within and surrounding tumors, is still lacking. The purpose of the study is to develop a clinically useful technique that can map functional regions within tumoral brains. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe developed an individual‐specific functional network parcellation approach using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) that effectively captured functional networks within and nearby tumors in 20 patients. We examined the accuracy of the functional maps using invasive cortical stimulation and task response. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe found that approximately 33.2% of the tumoral mass appeared to be functionally active and demonstrated robust functional connectivity with non‐tumoral brain regions. Functional networks nearby tumors were validated by invasive cortical stimulation mapping. Intratumoral sensorimotor networks mapped by our technique could be distinguished by their distinct cortico‐cerebellar connectivity patterns and were consistent with hand movement evoked fMRI task activations. Furthermore, in some patients, cognitive networks that were detected in the tumor mass showed long‐distance and distributed functional connectivity. \n\n\n## Interpretation \n  \nOur noninvasive approach to mapping individual‐specific functional networks using rsfMRI represents a promising new tool for identifying regions with preserved functional connectivity within and surrounding brain tumors, and could be used as a complement to presurgical planning for patients undergoing tumor resection surgery. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:353–366 \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nBrain tumors can invade or enclose healthy brain tissues. Recent evidence from invasive stimulation mapping and noninvasive functional neuroimaging studies suggests that functionally intact regions may be preserved within the invading tumors. ,   The intermixed cellularity of brain tumors with non‐neuronal tumor cells, neurons and neuronal supporting cell populations raises the possibility that function may be retained intratumorally.  Accurate identification and comprehensive delineation of intratumoral functional regions in individual patients’ brains may facilitate presurgical planning by balancing the need for maximal tumor resection while simultaneously preserving brain function. However, current functional mapping techniques are limited in either their mapping extent and/or their level of accuracy. \n\nDirect cortical stimulation (DCS), the current “gold standard” for intraoperative functional mapping, can accurately map critical functional areas but has been somewhat limited to for use in the sensorimotor and language regions. ,   Cortical areas critical to cognition are often neglected simply due to the difficulty in assessing cognitive processes in the operating room, despite the fact that these areas subserve essential functions that are strongly tied to clinical outcomes.  Task‐evoked functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is routinely used during presurgical planning to localize critical functional areas near and within tumors.  However, it often suffers from low reliability  and requires active patient participation, which can be challenging for children or patients with severe cognitive impairments. \n\nResting‐state fMRI (rsfMRI) represents a promising tool for mapping functional networks in patients with brain tumors because data can be acquired without patients performing any specific tasks. At the population‐level, parcellating large‐scale cortical functional networks using rsfMRI can reveal the general principle of functional brain organization. ,   However, due to substantial intersubject differences, ,   the cortical networks mapped at the population‐level lack the precision needed to be useful in the individual. Emerging rsfMRI‐based analytical approaches, such as embodied by our novel individual‐specific functional network parcellation method, can reveal the presence of unique but subtle subnetworks and have been shown to outperform task‐based fMRI activations in capturing DCS positive sites in sensorimotor areas. ,  ,   To date, these individual‐specific functional mapping techniques have largely focused on healthy brains and relied on reconstructed cortical surfaces. In the tumoral brain, healthy tissue and functionally preserved areas might be displaced or damaged with progression of the invading tumor. ,   Due to the effects of tumoral mass changes over time on the arrangement of surrounding brain tissues, cortical surface reconstruction becomes arduous, and results may be inaccurate.  Thus, development of a more precise and accurate rsfMRI‐based individual functional mapping method for tumor patients is urgently needed. \n\nHere, we developed a whole‐brain, volumetric functional network parcellation approach for tumoral brains using rsfMRI and applied this method to 20 patients with de novo tumors before surgery. The accuracy of our mapping approach can be partially validated by invasive DCS and task response. Our approach is novel in that individual‐specific functional networks across the whole cerebral cortex can be identified, including areas within and nearby tumors. This technology has potential clinical utility for improving presurgical planning and achieving better clinical outcomes. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### \nParticipants\n \n  \nOur sample consisted of 20 patients with brain tumors located in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes (18 patients with gliomas, 1 patient with extraventricular neurocytoma, and 1 patient with hemangiopericytoma; 13 men and 7 women; mean age is 35.4 ± 12.8 years). Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patient sample are shown in the Table  . All patients met the following inclusion criteria: (1) right‐handedness, (2) patients with newly diagnosed tumors, and (3) a clinical need for an MRI scan. Exclusion criteria were: (1) prior brain tumor surgery, (2) any contraindication for MRI scanning, and (3) history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. According to the 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) classification,  histology of these lesions included low‐grade (WHO grade I/II,   n   = 14) and high‐grade (WHO grade III/IV,   n   = 4) cases. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. \n  \nPatient Demographic and Clinical Data \n    \n\n### \nData Collection\n \n  \nStructural and fMRI were collected using a 3 Tesla Siemens TimTrio scanner equipped with a 32‐channel head coil. Structural images were obtained using an MP‐RAGE 3D T1‐weighted sequence (TR = 2,530 ms; TE = 3.37 ms; flip angle = 7°; 1.0 mm isotropic voxels; FOV = 256 × 256) and a T2‐weighted sequence (TR = 5,800 ms; TE = 117 ms; flip angle = 90 degrees; 0.5 × 0.5 × 6.0 mm  voxels; FOV = 240 × 240). The fMRI data were acquired using an echo planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence (TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 90 degrees; 3.44 × 3.44 × 3.750 mm  voxels, matrix size = 64 × 64, 33 slices fully covering whole brain). Each patient underwent an 8‐minute resting‐state scan wherein the patient was instructed to stay awake and keep their eyes open. In addition to the resting‐state scan, two hand motor task fMRI runs were acquired for each patient; one run was acquired for the left hand and one run was acquired for the right hand. Each 2‐minute run consisted of two 30‐second motor task blocks interleaved with three 20‐second rest intervals. Patients performed hand movement tasks according to instructions displayed on the computer screen. \n\n\n### \nData Preprocessing\n \n  \nAll structural MRI data were processed using FreeSurfer version 5.3.0 ( ). Functional data were preprocessed using the pipeline described in previous studies, ,   which includes: (1) slice timing correction (SPM12 software, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology), (2) rigid‐body correction for head motion using FSL package,  (3) normalization for global mean signal intensity across runs, (4) band‐pass temporal filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz), and (5) regression of 6 motion parameters, whole‐brain signal, and ventricular and white‐matter signals. Task activations were estimated using a conventional general linear model (GLM) with FSL's FEAT ( ). \n\n\n### \nDirect Cortical Stimulation Mapping during Awake Craniotomy\n \n  \nThe DCS was performed to identify the hand sensorimotor areas in 15 patients.  Trains of 60‐Hz biphasic pulses were delivered via electrodes using an Ojemann Cortical Stimulator (Integra Life, Plainsboro, NJ, USA) during awake craniotomy (square wave with a pulse width of 1 second). Stimulation commenced with an intensity of 1 mA and was gradually increased with a step of 0.5 mA. Delivery of DCS terminated when involuntary hand movements were induced according to the 2/3 principle  or the stimulation intensity reached 6 mA. The DCS‐positive sites were noted using fiducial markers with a diameter of 5 mm and then registered to the subject's T1‐weighted MRI. \n\n\n### \nTumor Segmentation\n \n  \nBrain tumors were manually segmented by consensus reading (2 board‐certified neuroradiologists) of T2‐weighted images using MRIcroN version 1.0 ( ). As described in our previous study,  areas containing abnormal hyperintense signals on the T2‐weighted images were identified as tumors. A senior neuroradiologist then re‐evaluated the lesion and demarcated the tumor boundaries. \n\n\n### \nPopulation‐Level Volumetric Functional Atlas\n \n  \nA volumetric functional atlas consisting of 17 networks was estimated using data of 1,000 healthy subjects described in previous studies. ,   In the original atlas, hand and foot sensorimotor areas were not distinguished. Here we separated these 2 functional regions. The volumetric atlas consisting of 18 networks served as an initial iteration for our individual parcellation procedure. \n\n\n### \nIndividual‐Level Network Parcellation in the Lesioned Brain\n \n  \nHemispheric lesions resulting from brain tumors may disrupt surface reconstruction. To address this issue, we proposed an iterative individual parcellation approach (see Fig  ) based on our previous method : \n  \nThe schematic diagram of an individualized functional network parcellation approach for patients with tumors. The network parcellation strategy includes the following 5 steps: (1) a group‐level network atlas consisting of 18 functional networks in the contralesional hemisphere is registered onto the patient’s anatomic brain image using a nonlinear registration. The patient’s BOLD signals were averaged across voxels within each functional network and used as the “reference signal” for the subsequent step. (2) An iterative algorithm was used to reassign each voxel in the contralesional hemisphere to 1 of the 18 functional networks according to the maximal correlation values to the reference signals generated from the previous step. (3) In the lesional hemisphere, the BOLD signal of each voxel is correlated to the 18 reference signals of the contralesional hemisphere and the “tumor network” signal. These voxels are assigned to the 19 networks (18 functional networks and the tumor network) according to the maximum of the correlation value. (4) The same iterative process as in step (2) is used to parcellate the lesional hemisphere into 19 networks. (5) To combine the results from both hemispheres, each voxel is reassigned to the 19 networks according to the maximum correlation between the time course of the voxel and the reference signals averaged from the 2 hemispheres. \n  \n1. Initialization: For each patient, the volumetric population‐level functional atlas was projected onto the patient's contralesional hemisphere using a nonlinear registration and used for the initial parcellation. The patient's fMRI signals were averaged across voxels within each functional network and used as the “reference signal” for the subsequent reassignment step. \n\n2. Mapping individualized functional networks in the contralesional hemisphere: Each voxel was reassigned to 1 of the 18 functional networks according to the maximal correlation values to the 18 reference signals generated from the previous step. A confidence value was set as the ratio between the largest and the second largest correlation values. Functional individualization using an iterative process, described in our previous report,  was then performed in order to reassign all voxels in the gray matter area to 1 of the 18 functional networks. Then, a temporary individualized parcellation for the contralesional hemisphere was obtained until the procedure reached a preselected number of iterations. \n\n3. Functional mapping of the lesional hemisphere: We constructed new reference signals, including reference signals of the 18 canonical networks in the contralesional hemisphere from step 2, and a reference signal of the tumor network derived from the average signal of a seed region of interest (ROI) placed in the tumor area. The BOLD signal of each voxel in the lesional hemisphere was correlated to these 19 new reference signals. According to the maximum of Pearson's correlation coefficients, each voxel was assigned to 1 of the 19 networks. For example, if a voxel had a stronger correlation with the reference signal of the tumor network compared to other networks, it would be reassigned to the tumor network. The tumor network is not a functional network but rather brain regions spatially restricted by the tumor that showed temporally correlated BOLD signals that differed from the 18 canonical networks. The time courses of the voxels within each network were averaged and used as the new reference signal for the next step. \n\n4. Functional individualization of the lesional hemisphere: The same optimization procedure as detailed in step 2 was conducted in the lesional hemisphere for parcellation of the 19 networks, which ended when the iteration reached a predetermined number. We then obtained the temporary functional parcellation for the lesional hemisphere. \n\n5. Combining 2 hemispheres: The reference signals for the whole brain were generated by averaging the reference signals in step 2 for the contralesional hemisphere and the reference signals in step 4 for the lesional hemisphere. Next, the BOLD signal for each voxel from the whole brain was correlated with the new reference signals. The maximal correlation value was used to determine the final network assignment of each voxel. \n\n\n### \nStatistical Analysis\n \n  \nWe compared WHO low‐grade (N = 14) and high‐grade (N = 4) tumors in terms of the ratio between functional tissues and the tumor volume. Two‐sided Wilcoxon rank‐sum test was used for the comparison ( ). We also examined differences in gender and age between these 2 groups using chi‐square and 2‐sided Wilcoxon rank‐sum tests, respectively. In addition, Pearson's correlations between the ratios of intratumoral functional regions and tumor volumes were calculated ( ). A voxel‐based Dice coefficient was used to evaluate the similarity between seed‐based functional connectivity maps. Permutation tests (1,000 permutations) were performed to examine whether functional connectivity maps derived from a pair of adjacent seeds in 2 functional networks were more distinct from each other than maps derived from 2 randomly selected seeds in the tumor network. Note that the Euclidean distance between the randomly selected tumor seeds was kept identical to the distance between the seeds in functional networks. Two‐sided Wilcoxon signed‐rank tests were conducted to examine the difference in cortico‐cortical and cortico‐cerebellar sensorimotor functional connectivity values between groups. In addition, a 2‐sided Wilcoxon rank‐sum test was used to examine the existence of functional connectivity between the seeds in intratumoral network and sensorimotor regions in contralateral cerebral cortex or cerebellum. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### \nMapping Individual‐Specific Functional Networks in Tumor Patients\n \n  \nWe parcellated the cerebral cortices of 20 patients with brain tumors into 18 large‐scale functional networks and an additional “tumor network,” for a total of 19 networks (Fig  ). Overall, tumor networks fell within the anatomic boundaries demarcating the tumors in the T1‐weighted images, often showing a high degree of overlap (see Fig  , see PA03, PA10, and PA12 for examples). However, in some patients, tumor networks only encompassed a circumscribed area within the tumoral margins in the T1‐weighted image, wherein functionally preserved networks were also detected (see PA05 in Fig  ). \n  \nIndividual parcellation delineates individual‐specific functional networks and the tumor network. (A) Eighteen large‐scale functional networks and one additional tumor network were mapped in each of the 20 tumoral brains using the individual‐specific functional parcellation method. The individual parcellation of four representative patients, PA03, PA10, PA05, and PA12, are displayed. For each patient, the T2‐weighted images (  upper panels  ), the T1‐weighted images (  middle panels  ), and the individual‐specific networks (  bottom panels  ) overlaid onto the T1‐weighted images are shown. The red arrows depict the location of the tumor in the T2‐ and T1‐weighted images. The tumor network is indicated by a gray color and the other 18 functional networks are color‐coded with the same colors and naming conventions as reported in our previous study.  (B) Histogram shows the distribution of the percentage of intratumoral functional regions in patients with tumors. Half of the patients with tumors have a high proportion of functional regions within tumors. (C) The ratio of intratumoral functional regions in tumor mass is unrelated to tumor volume (  r   = −0.10,   p   = 0.66). \n  \nTo evaluate the mismatch between the functional and anatomic boundaries, we calculated the Ratio of the Intratumoral Functional Regions to tumor volume (RIFR) across the 20 patients. The RIFR was 33.2% ± 26.9% (mean ± SD). In a small subset of patients (N = 5), more than 50% of the tumoral mass was detected as intratumoral functional regions (Fig  ). In 10 patients, the ratio was greater than 25% of the tumoral mass. No significant correlation was found between RIFR to tumor volume (Pearson's correlation,   r   = −0.10,   p   = 0.66; Fig  ). Moreover, patients with low‐grade gliomas showed a significantly greater RIFR (RIFR = 40.3% ± 27.9%; N = 14) than those patients with high‐grade gliomas (RIFR = 8.5% ± 6.0%; N = 4; two‐sided Wilcoxon rank‐sum test,   p   = 0.025), whereas no significant difference in gender (chi‐square test,   p   = 0.69, χ  = 0.16) or age (2‐sided Wilcoxon rank‐sum test,   p   = 0.74) was found in these 2 groups. \n\nTo examine the accuracy of the tumor network and functional networks mapped in each patient, we placed 2 pairs of seeds adjacent to the boundary of the tumor network (Figs  , 3C). For each pair of seeds, one seed was placed within a functional network that was located outside the tumor network, and the other seed was placed in close proximity but within the tumor network. A series of seed‐based functional connectivity analyses were performed and the resulting connectivity maps for 2 representative patients, PA12 (seeds A/B and C/D) and PA15 (seeds E/F and G/H), are shown in Figures   and 3D. For these 2 patients, one seed from each pair was placed in the ventral attention network (vATN) and the default mode network (DMN), whereas the other seed was placed in the tumor network. Despite adjacent locations of the paired seeds, their connectivity patterns were significantly different (Pair A/B: Dice coefficient = 18.01%, permutation test,   p   < 0.001 and   z  ‐score = −5.09; Pair C/D: Dice coefficient = 21.21%,   p   = 0.010 and   z  ‐score = −2.38; Pair E/F: Dice coefficient = 16.04%,   p   < 0.001 and   z  ‐score = −2.94; Pair G/H: Dice coefficient = 14.79%,   p   = 0.025 and   z  ‐score = −2.00; see Methods). For seeds placed in functional regions, distributed patterns of connectivity were observed that spanned widespread regions of the brain and included long‐distance connections in the corresponding networks. In contrast, seeds placed in the tumor network only showed local patterns of connectivity that were restricted predominantly to the tumor (see Figs  , 3D). These distinct connectivity patterns illustrate that our approach can successfully differentiate regions that have residual function and interact with remote brain areas and regions that lack functional activity within tumors. \n  \nAdjacent seeds within and nearby tumor networks show distinct functional connectivity patterns. In 2 representative patients, PA12 and PA15, tumors and functional networks surrounding the tumors are highlighted. The anatomic boundaries of the tumors are demarcated by the blue lines. (A) Two pairs of seeds (pair A/B and C/D) are placed adjacent to the boundary of the tumor network in PA12. For each pair, one seed is placed in a functional network (seeds B and D) and another seed is placed nearby but within the tumor network (seeds A and C). (B) Seeds B and D demonstrate distributed connectivity corresponding to vATN and DMN, whereas seeds A and C show mostly local connectivity constrained within the tumor. (C) In the other patient with a tumor (PA15), 2 pairs of seeds (pair E/F and G/H) are placed within (seeds E and G) and nearby (seeds F and H) the tumor networks. (D) Similar to PA12, each pair of seeds shows distinct connectivity patterns. DMN = default mode network; FC = functional connectivity; vATN = ventral attention network. \n  \n\n### \nIndividual Sensorimotor Network Can Be Validated by Invasive Cortical Simulation\n \n  \nTo further validate the individualized functional networks derived from our parcellation method, we compared the sensorimotor networks mapped by our approach with the hand sensorimotor regions localized by DCS. Preoperative functional localization using DCS, the current “gold standard” in clinical practice, was performed in 15 out of 20 patients. The hand motor networks mapped by our rsfMRI approach corresponded to the hand sensorimotor region localized by DCS in 100% of patients (15/15 patients; Fig  ). The high concordance between hand sensorimotor maps derived using the functional parcellation approach and those captured using DCS suggests the sensitivity of our method for identifying functional networks in individual subjects. \n  \nSensorimotor networks mapped by our approach is partially validated by invasive cortical stimulation. For each patient, the hand sensorimotor network was mapped by our individualized parcellation approach, with the confidence map (the ratio between the largest and the second largest correlation values to the reference signals of the 19 networks) indicated by warm colors. Blue dots indicate positive sites of DCS for the hand sensorimotor regions. In all 15 patients with DCS results, DCS positive sites fell within the hand motor networks mapped by our parcellation approach. DCS = direct cortical stimulation. \n  \n\n### \nPatients With and Without Intratumoral Functional Regions Show Distinct Cortico‐Cerebellar Functional Connectivity Patterns\n \n  \nTo further assess the degree to which functional networks neighboring the invading tumors had preserved connectivity, we examined the connectivity between functional regions and the cerebellum. We placed seeds adjacent to the boundary between the functional network and the tumor in one patient (see PA14 in Fig  ), which had a tumor located in the parietal lobe. Seed A was placed in the hand sensorimotor network identified by our individual parcellation method, whereas seed B was placed adjacent to seed A but located in the patient's tumor network. The functional connectivity map for seed A showed strong connectivity with the contralateral cerebellar sensorimotor regions. Conversely, seed B, which was located in the tumor network, showed weak cortico‐cortical and cortico‐cerebellar connectivity with values significantly lower than for seed A in PA14 (2‐sided Wilcoxon signed‐rank test,   p   < 0.0001; Fig  ). The above finding can be replicated in another patient (PA17, the 2‐sided Wilcoxon signed‐rank test,   p   < 0.0001). The observed disparity in cerebro‐cerebellar connectivity patterns for adjacent seeds placed within and outside the tumor network suggest that critical brain networks surrounding tumors may be functionally preserved in these patients. \n  \nCortical sensorimotor networks within or nearby the tumor show functional connectivity with the contralateral cerebellar sensorimotor regions. (A) In subject PA14, the hand sensorimotor network surrounds the tumor (  blue lines  ). A pair of seeds was placed outside (seed A;   top, left panel  ) and within the tumor (seed B;   top, right panel  ). Seed A, located within the sensorimotor network shows strong functional connectivity with the contralateral cortical and cerebellar sensorimotor regions. In contrast, an adjacent seed, seed B shows local functional connectivity restricted within the tumoral margins and no significant cortico‐cerebellar connectivity. (B) The cortico‐cortical and cortico‐cerebellar functional connectivity of seed A is significantly higher than those of seed B for subject PA14 (Wilcoxon signed‐rank test,   p   < 0.0001). (C) The sensorimotor network falls within the anatomic boundary of the tumor in subject PA05 (  top panel  ). A seed (seed C) placed in the intratumoral sensorimotor network shows significant functional connectivity with the cerebellar sensorimotor regions, suggesting that function might be retained in the sensorimotor regions within the tumor. (D) For PA05, seed C shows significant connectivity to contralateral cerebral and cerebellar sensorimotor regions (Wilcoxon rank‐sum test,   p   < 0.0001). FC = functional connectivity. \n  \nIn some patients, sensorimotor networks fell within the anatomic boundaries of the tumor mass. To evaluate whether sensorimotor function remained intact in regions invaded by these gliomas, a seed was placed in the intratumoral hand sensorimotor network (see seed C in Fig  ). We found that significant functional connectivity was still present in the hand sensorimotor regions of the contralateral cerebral cortex and cerebellum (2‐sided Wilcoxon rank‐sum test,   p   < 0.0001; Fig  ). The presence of cortico‐cortical and cortico‐cerebellar functional connectivity indicates that motor function may be preserved in the sensorimotor regions invaded by tumors. \n\n\n### \nIntratumoral Sensorimotor Networks Were Consistent with Task Activations\n \n  \nTo determine the extent to which sensorimotor networks identified nearby and within tumors were functionally significant, we compared the sensorimotor networks with the hand movement induced fMRI task activations. For PA14, the hand sensorimotor network nearby the tumor was activated when the patient performed a hand movement task (Fig  ), whereas the tissue invaded by the tumor showed no task‐induced activations. Conversely, for PA05, with an identified intratumoral sensorimotor region (ISR), task activation was observed both inside and outside the tumor, and corresponded spatially with the sensorimotor network (Fig  ). We statistically compared the task responses in ISR and tumor networks in totally 3 patients whose tumors included ISR. We found that task responses in ISR (  β   = 2.28 ± 1.50) were significantly higher than those in the tumor networks (  β   = 0.69 ± 0.90;   p   < 0.0001 for all 3 patients, Wilcoxon rank‐sum tests; Fig  ), suggesting that the detected ISR invaded by tumors were recruited during the motor task. \n  \nCortical sensorimotor networks nearby or within the tumor corresponded to regions showing hand motor task activations. (A) The hand sensorimotor network adjacent to a tumor in PA14. A repetitive hand motor task evoked BOLD signal activation that corresponded topographically with the sensorimotor network derived from our resting‐state functional connectivity parcellation. (B) The hand sensorimotor network located nearby and within the tumoral boundary in PA05. The hand motor task induced fMRI activation that spatially overlapped with the sensorimotor network but did not extend into the tumor network indicated by grey color. (C) For 3 patients with intratumoral sensorimotor regions (ISR), we compared motor task responses measured using extracted   β  ‐values derived from the general linear model within the ISRs and tumor networks. Each line represents a patient. Error bars represent the standard deviations of   β  ‐values across all voxels within the ISRs or tumor networks. Task responses in the ISR were significantly stronger than those in the detected tumor network for each patient (  p   < 0.0001 for all 3 patients, Wilcoxon rank‐sum tests). fMRI = functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n  \n\n### \nIntratumoral Higher‐Order Association Functional Networks Show Characteristic Distributed Functional Connectivity Patterns\n \n  \nWe observed that higher‐order association networks demonstrated canonical functional connectivity profiles despite being invaded by tumors. For example, in 2 patients whose frontal cortices were partially invaded by tumors (PA17 and PA11), the tumor regions were parcellated into one tumor network and several association functional networks, such as the frontal–parietal network (FPN), DMN, and dATN (Fig  ). We placed 3 seeds in each of these functional regions (seeds A/B/C for PA17, and seeds D/E/F for PA11) and generated functional connectivity maps for each patient. Widespread and distributed functional connectivity patterns across the cerebral cortex were observed for these seeds. These connectivity maps show consistent network topologies with the corresponding individual‐specific functional networks mapped by the whole brain parcellation method (Spearman's   r   = 0.46, 0.47, 0.59 and all   p   values < 0.0001 for seeds A/B/C; Spearman's   r   = 0.49, 0.64, 0.65 and all   p   values < 0.0001 for seeds D/E/F), suggesting that intratumoral association functional regions may have preserved network properties. \n  \nFunctional regions invaded by tumors show characteristic distributed functional connectivity patterns of association functional networks. Individual‐specific parcellations identified several association networks (  left column  ), such as the FPN (  orange and purple colors   indicate subnetworks FPN B and FPN C), DMN B (  yellow  ), and dATN B (  green  ) near or within the tumors (demarcated by   blue lines  ). Seeds were placed in these functional regions. Functional connectivity maps of these seed regions show characteristic distributed patterns across the cerebral cortex (  middle column  ) and converge to the corresponding individual‐specific functional networks identified by our parcellation approach (  right column  ), suggesting that higher‐order cognitive functions may remain intact within regions invaded by tumors. ATN = attention network; DMN = default mode network; FC = functional connectivity; FPN = frontal–parietal network. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, an individualized brain network parcellation method was developed to map functional networks in tumor patients. In 20 patients, about 33.2% of the tumoral mass was classified as functional regions. In addition, we found that low‐grade gliomas may have more regions with preserved functional connectivity than high‐grade gliomas. Individualized sensorimotor networks nearby and within tumors could be validated using invasive cortical simulation and task response, respectively. Cortico‐cerebellar sensorimotor connectivity in these patients provides further evidence that characteristic functional connectivity may be preserved in regions invaded by tumor cells. Finally, the presence of long‐distance higher‐order functional connectivity suggests that cognitive functions may also be preserved intratumorally. Taken together, our results indicate that our individualized functional network parcellation approach can successfully delineate functional regions within and nearby tumors and has potential clinical applications for patients undergoing resection surgery. \n\n### \nImplications for Tumor Resections and Prognoses\n \n  \nResecting tumors with functional intact regions inside can potentially cause new neurological functional deficits to arise, which will adversely affect the patient's quality of life. ,   Our data indicated that the functional and anatomic boundaries of tumors may be mismatched. Therefore, revealing the functional network topography surrounding and within tumors will enable one to predict the risk of postsurgical deficit and provide more objective information to assess the risk to benefit ratio of the planned surgery. This does not negate the need for intraoperative stimulation mapping for surgical planning, rather our parcellation approach could serve as a preoperative reference used in tandem with DCS to more precisely identify the presence or absence of functional regions within tumors, which may have been missed otherwise. \n\nImportantly, our technology has clinical implications for the development of novel “prehabilitation” strategies. For patients requiring extensive resectioning, despite the presence of functionally intact zones intratumorally, our parcellation approach when coupled with targeted and personalized neuromodulation therapies prior to surgery, such as continuous direct cortical stimulation (cDCS) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), may take advantage of the brain's ability to functionally re‐organize and undergo neuroplastic changes. Previous reports show that presurgical suppression of the eloquent areas by cDCS or TMS promotes reorganization of functional regions within gliomas. ,   This prehabilitation procedure may displace eloquent areas from the glioma tissue to nearby regions or toward the contralateral hemisphere.  The capability of our parcellation to accurately identify individual‐specific eloquent areas shows promising potential for guiding the personalized intratumoral targeting and evaluating the prehabilitation procedure. A successful eloquent functional displacement could minimize postoperative functional impairment and improve prognosis. \n\n\n### \nRevealing Tumor Tissue by Functional Scope\n \n  \nEvidence from a previous study suggests that BOLD signals from inside the tumor are significantly different from those located in surrounding healthy tissues.  Here, we utilized this characteristic of the BOLD signals to map nonfunctional tumor networks. It is noteworthy that the tumor networks are often more circumscribed than the anatomic boundaries demarcated by abnormal intensity identified using conventional MRI techniques. In other words, the tumor network demarcates a boundary, outside rather than within, which functional consideration should be taken more care. The functional boundary of the tumor could be a potentially critical concept in neurosurgical practice in the near future. \n\nThe mechanism of temporal synchronization of BOLD fluctuations within tumor networks remains unclear. It has been shown that the BOLD signal is largely dependent on the oxygen extraction ratio, the levels of oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin.  The histological and pathophysiological characteristics of the tumor may change the above feature, thus producing abnormal BOLD signals.  Although the mechanism is not fully understood, 2 main factors are thought to contribute to the tumor‐related BOLD signal components. First, the intratumoral blood flow and oxygenation are much higher than other brain tissues, and change according to the relatively consistent metabolic rate across the tumor volume, as brain tumors undergo angiogenesis to support the increase in metabolism as tumor cells divide.  In tumoral brains, it has been reported that invading tumor cells lead to loss of physiological astrocyte function, inducing vasoconstriction or vasodilation in response to neuronal activity. ,   Normal brain activity has a limited effect on tumor oxygenation and blood flow if the remaining intratumoral functional areas are not considered. ,   Therefore, signals within tumors are highly temporally synchronized and do not necessarily follow the fluctuations that are found in functional areas outside the tumor. Second, near‐tumoral blood flow and oxygenation are affected by the large tumor mass. A hypoxic microenvironment may be induced by malignant cancer cell proliferation and blood vessel deformation during tumor angiogenesis.  Despite the blood perfusion promoted by vascular autoregulation, the peripheral infiltration of these tissues still shows decreases in blood volume and partial pressure of oxygen. ,   The changes due to oxygenation may enhance the difference in BOLD signals compared with the neovascularized area found within tumors. \n\n\n### \nRevealing Individual‐Specific Intratumoral Functional Networks\n \n  \nA body of empirical evidence suggests that specific functional regions may remain within the tumoral margin. For example, Rivera et al  performed intraoperative cortical stimulation mapping to confirm the presence of language and movement‐related functional regions within the tumor for a patient with glioma. The resection of these areas led to right hemiplegia and aphasia severely affecting the patient's quality of life. In another study, Daniel et al  utilized fMRI to quantify preserved functional connectivity within glioblastomas. In the current study, we found intratumoral functional networks were present in the majority of patients. Low‐grade gliomas showed a significantly greater number of intratumoral functional regions than high‐grade gliomas, despite the limited sample size of high‐grade gliomas. These results suggest that the ratio of intratumoral functional regions to tumor mass may have potential clinical utility as a biomarker for distinguishing more advanced or aggressive brain tumor typologies. The differential preservation of intratumoral functional networks within low‐grade relative to high‐grade gliomas may be attributed to 2 key factors. First, tumoral tissues are characterized as infiltrative and histologically heterogeneous. ,   For low‐grade gliomas, higher density of viable tumor cells is found in the central parts of the tumor tissue and decreases towards the periphery.  Active tumors are disseminated neoplasms with a fringe of invasive cells around a core lesion.  It is possible that neoplasms have spread from the initial lesion, and in the low‐degree infiltrated regions, invasive cells are mixed with neuropil that retains intrinsic functional connectivity. Second, recent studies suggest high‐grade gliomas may engage neural circuits by electrochemical communication through neuron‐glioma synapses. ,   These bidirectional interactions are fundamental to glioma progression. It is therefore possible that these neuron‐glioma interconnections act as conduits for functional connectivity with downstream neurons creating an electrically coupled network and subsequently, functionally linking other distant regions that are also connected, albeit indirectly. \n\n\n### \nLimitations and Future Directions\n \n  \nThere are several limitations worth mentioning. First, our sample size was limited (N = 20). There were 4 patients with high‐grade tumors involved in the comparison of RIFR. The findings are therefore subject to future replications in larger samples. Second, in regard to the functional connectivity observed intratumorally, the resulting long‐distance connectivity profile provided probable rather than definitive evidence that these regions may have preserved functional properties, despite task‐evoked responses. These findings should be validated by DCS or clinical neurosurgery outcomes in a more rigorous manner. Third, a spatial smoothing step involved in the fMRI preprocessing pipeline blurs BOLD signals both outside and inside tumors. This may cause the boundary of the tumor network to be inaccurate. To address this potential confound, we smoothed BOLD signals outside and inside tumor masks separately and compared the functional connectivity (FC) results shown in Figure  . The similar connectivity maps (average Dice = 86.33% ± 5.43%) demonstrated that our spatial smoothing strategy was not an important factor affecting the functional connectivity patterns within tumors. Fourth, the tumor network was derived from an ROI seed placed in the center of the tumor tissue. To evaluate the possibility of initial seed positions, we randomly placed 10 tumor seeds within the boundary of tumors for each patient. The high reliability of the parcellation results (average Dice = 97.22% ± 1.41% across all patients) illustrates that our parcellation is nearly independent of the initial tumor seed selection. \n\n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nH.L., Y.L., L.L., T.J., and H.Z. contributed to the conception and design of the study.

However, significant data heterogeneity between imaging sites, caused by different scanners or protocols, can negatively impact the generalization ability of learned models. In addition, previous studies have shown that graph convolution neural networks (GCNs) are effective in mining fMRI biomarkers. However, they generally ignore the potentially different contributions of brain regions- of-interest (ROIs) to automated disease diagnosis/prognosis. In this work, we propose a multi-site rs-fMRI adaptation framework with attention GCN (A GCN) for brain disorder identification. Specifically, the proposed A GCN consists of three major components: (1) a node representation learning module based on GCN to extract rs-fMRI features from functional connectivity networks, (2) a node attention mechanism module to capture the contributions of ROIs, and (3) a domain adaptation module to alleviate the differences in data distribution between sites through the constraint of mean absolute error and covariance. The A GCN not only reduces data heterogeneity across sites, but also improves the interpretability of the learning algorithm by exploring important ROIs. Experimental results on the public ABIDE database demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance in fMRI-based recognition of autism spectrum disorders. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an imaging technique that uses blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals to obtain functional graphs of brain activity while subjects are at rest [ ]. Compared with other fMRI techniques, rs-fMRI has advantages because it is non-invasive and has high tissue resolution, and it can skillfully detect the difference between the functional activity network of the human brain under pathological conditions and that of the normal human brain [ ]. At the same time, benefiting from the progress of scanning hardware and scanning technology, as well as the rapid development of computer vision technology, rs-fMRI has gradually become one of the effective means to study the human brain in recent years. Relying on rs-fMRI technology, researchers have made remarkable achievements in the auxiliary diagnosis, pathogenesis research, objective biomarker search and other aspects of mental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Major Depressive Disorder [ , ]. \n\nCurrently, the application of machine learning/deep learning in natural image analysis is very successful. In contrast, its use in the analysis of neuroimaging data presents some unique problems, including dimensional disaster, small sample size, and limited true labels [ , ]. With the continued efforts of researchers, public multi-site neuroimage datasets, increasing the sample size and statistical power of data, are helping to promote the adoption of data-driven machine learning/deep learning techniques. However, the study of multi-site datasets will face another important challenge. That is, the distribution of data between sites is often quite different due to external factors such as different scanners or protocols [ , ]. This will severely limit the generalization ability of machine/deep learning models, as such algorithms often start with the assumption that all data remain the same distribution [ , , ]. \n\nStudies have shown that detection of abnormal low-frequency fluctuations in the BOLD signals caused by pathological changes in the resting state will facilitate the analysis of brain connectivity and provide scientific and reliable treatment options before and after surgery [ ]. Typically in studies of neuroimaging data, brain functional connectivity networks (FCNs) attempt to establish a potential causal link between two regions-of-interest (ROIs) based on linear temporal correlations [ ]. Previous studies usually use statistical measures of FCNs (including betweenness centrality, degree centrality, and other features) to construct prediction models [ , ]. These practices often rely on extensive expert knowledge and are subjective, expensive, and time-consuming. FCN is usually defined as a complex non-Euclidean space graph structure [ ]. In recent years, graph neural networks, especially graph convolutional networks (GCNs), have become one of the effective tools to deal with irregular graph data. GCN is a natural extension of the convolutional neural network in a graph domain [ , ]. It can be used as a feature extractor to learn node feature information and structure information end-to-end at the same time, which is the best choice for graph data learning task at present [ , ]. When GCN is naturally used to analyze rs-fMRI data, comprehensive mapping of brain FC patterns can effectively describe the functional activity of the brain [ , ]. However, existing studies usually ignore the potential contribution of different brain functional regions to the diagnosis of brain diseases, thus affecting the interpretability of the GCN model. \n\nAs shown in  , we construct a domain adaptation model with attention GCN (A GCN) of multi-site rs-fMRI for ASD diagnosis. For the convenience of description, we set a known site as the source domain, and define the site to be predicted as the target domain. In this paper, we focus on the classification task of graphs. Therefore, we first construct the corresponding FCNs based on the rs-fMRI data of subjects from the source/target domains, and take the FCNs as the corresponding source/target graphs. Then, we use GCN as a feature extractor to capture the nodes/ROIs representations from the source/target graphs respectively through the graph convolution layers. In addition, the node attention mechanism is applied to explore the contribution weight of nodes/ROIs automatically. Finally, the objective function composed of multiple loss functions is jointly optimized, so as to establish a cross-domain classification model with a wider application range. We will use rs-fMRI data from the three sites (NYU, UM, UCLA) of the public ABIDE database [ ] to identify ASD patients from healthy controls (HCs) to evaluate the performance of our approach. \n\nThe rest of this work is shown below: In  , we briefly review the related research results of this work. In  , we present our method and experimental setup. In  , we introduce the data used in this work, the competing algorithms, and report the performance of different algorithms. At the same time, ablation experiments are added to investigate the contribution of key components in our proposed model. In  , we discuss several extension studies related to this work and propose future related work. Finally, in  , we summarize our proposed method. \n\n\n## 2. Related Work \n  \n### 2.1. Graph Convolution Network for fMRI Analysis \n  \nAt present, the application of deep learning framework, especially the graph convolutional networks (GCNs) model, to graph-structured data has aroused a warm response worldwide [ , ]. GCN is used to advance the feature learning of the network, which integrates the central node characteristics and graph topology information in the convolutional layer [ ]. In particular, GCN has achieved impressive results in helping researchers build mathematical models for computer-assisted diagnosis of brain diseases and process and analyze neuroimaging data quickly and efficiently [ ]. For example, Wang et al. [ ] defined a GCN architecture based on features of fMRI for brain disorder analysis. Based on the spatiotemporal information of rs-fMRI time series, Yao et al. [ ] constructed time-adaptive GCN architecture to study the periodic characteristics of the human brain. Gadgil et al. [ ] focused on the short subsequence of BOLD signal, so as to construct a spatio-temporal GCN architecture and explore the non-stationary properties of FC. Traditional GCN research usually regards feature representations of each node as independently and equally. That is, they did not consider the unique contribution of each specific node/ROI to rs-fMRI analysis. In this paper, we will establish a ROI/node feature attention mechanism based on GCN to learn potential functional dependencies among brain regions, which allows us to identify those most informative brain regions for diagnosis. This will significantly improve the interpretability of GCN models for automated fMRI analysis. \n\n\n### 2.2. Domain Adaptation for Brain Disorder Diagnosis \n  \nData acquired from multiple imaging sites are correlated but distributed differently, which is a classic domain adaptation problem [ , ]. According to the latest research, domain adaptation related algorithms can be roughly summarized into two categories: (1) supervised domain adaptation. The target domain samples contain a large or small amount of label information; (2) unsupervised domain adaptation. There is no data label available for the target domain [ ]. This work will focus on the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation, that is, samples from the source domain contain complete data labels, while samples from the target domain to be analyzed have no label information, which is more valuable and challenging for applications. In recent years, in order to achieve domain alignment, many cross-domain classification algorithms have been proposed, including adaptive methods based on discrepancy, adversarial learning and data reconstruction [ ]. In recent years, domain adaptation technology has also achieved remarkable results in the field of medical imaging. Ingalhalikar et al. [ ] coordinated multi-site neuroimaging data based on empirical Bayes formula to improve the accuracy of brain diagnostic classification. Guan et al. [ ] defined a multi-site domain attention model based on deep learning for brain disease recognition. Zhang et al. [ ] constructed an unsupervised domain adversarial network and established a brain disease prediction model with good classification performance. In this paper, we adopt the classical domain adaptation algorithm, that is, calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) and covariance of the source domain and the target domain at the same time, so as to guide the gradual alignment of node features learned from different domains and alleviate the domain offset problem. \n\n\n\n## 3. Methodology \n  \nIn this section, we will first describe the concepts and notation related to the unsupervised domain adaptation problem (as shown in  ), and then introduce our approach in detail. \n\n### 3.1. Notation and Problem Formulation \n  \nIn general, a feature space   X   of data and its marginal probability distribution   will form a domain  . In this work, the source domain data from the distribution   can be expressed as  ; target domain data from distribution   can be represented as  , where   and   are the feature dimension, and   and   are defined as the sample size in the source domain and target domain, respectively. In the unsupervised domain adaptation problem, the feature space and label space of the data from the source domain and the target domain are usually consistent, but the data distribution is different, that is,  . Our goal is to use the information learned from the source domain to assist in the graph classification task of a completely unmarked target domain. Our task is to build a good graph classification model for the target domain without any label based on labeled source domain. \n\nIn this article, we focus on representation learning of nodes on a graph. Therefore, we first build a graph for each subject of the source domain and target domain. A subject from the source domain is represented as a graph  , where   represents a labeled collection of nodes in  , and   represents the weighted adjacency matrix to quantify the connection strength between nodes.   represents the number of nodes/ROIs of  .   is the eigenmatrix of graph  , and the   i  -th row of   is the eigenvector related to node   i  .   is the label of  . In this paper, the label value of normal people is 0 and the category label of patients is 1. Similarly, each subject from the target domain is also defined as a graph  , which is a completely unlabeled network.   is the node set.   is the number of nodes/ROIs in  .   is the weighted adjacency matrix.   represents the feature matrix of  . \n\n\n### 3.2. Proposed Method \n  \nThe model A GCN designed in this paper mainly includes three modules: node representation learning, node attention mechanism and domain adaptation module as shown in  . In addition, our model will be described in detail below. \n\n#### 3.2.1. Node Representation Learning \n  \nTo facilitate the classification task of downstream graphs, we use GCN to capture the node representation information on each graph. \n\nFirst, we used the preprocessed BOLD signal to calculate the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PC) between nodes on the graph, and defined it as the functional connectivity   of the   i  -th and   j  -th brain regions, as follows: \nwhere  ,   or  , and it is the average time series signal from the   i  -th ROI.   is the number of time points of the ROI. In addition, the   represents the mean vector corresponding to  . \n\nThus, for the graph, the adjacency matrix   will be defined as: \nwhere   k   represents source domain   s   or target domain   t  . At the same time, for simplicity and convenience, we describe the feature matrix  , of each graph through the correlation coefficient (i.e.,  ). \n\nAccording to the traditional GCN model, given the input feature matrix   and adjacency matrix  , the output of the  -th hidden layer of the neural network   H   is: \nwhere   is the normalization of the adjacency matrix  , and  .   W   is the trainable weight matrix, that is, the parameters of the network;   is the activation function, and the ReLU function is used here.   represents the feature matrix of the layer   l   network.  , then  . \n\n\n#### 3.2.2. Node Attention Mechanism \n  \nFor each graph, the potential impact of nodes/ROIs features learned from the GCN module on related brain diseases is different. Therefore, this paper proposes a node attention mechanism module to automatically mine the weight of nodes on the graph. See   for details. After learning the node representation module, we naturally obtain new embedded representations of the source and target domains, that is,   from the source domain graph and   from the target domain graph. At this point,  , that is, the brains of subjects from different domains will be divided into the same number of functional areas. In addition,  . \n\nThen, max pooling is performed on   to generate the comprehensive representation of nodes, i.e.,  . We send the composite node representations to the two fully connected layers respectively to automatically generate the node’s attention score, i.e.,  , and it is defined as: \nwhere   is the bias term. The dimension of hidden layer of full connection layer is   N  , and   N  . The sigmoid function as a nonlinear activation function is used to constrain each element in the range  . Among them, the ROIs that contribute more to the predicted results for the model will be assigned more weight, while the brain regions that contribute less will be assigned less weight. \n\nTherefore, the final node representation is expressed as: \nwhere ⊙ represents the dot product operation, which weights the features of each extracted node. \n\n\n#### 3.2.3. Domain Adaptation Module \n  \nFor cross-domain classification, we propose to jointly optimize the three losses to reduce domain shift. Graph-level classification tasks typically use the readout operation to extract graph representations [ , ]. This can lead to missing important information, which can negatively affect feature alignment between domains. Therefore, we will choose to use mean absolute error (MAE) loss ( ) and CORAL loss [ ] ( ) respectively to align features before and after the readout operation. \n\n MAE Loss   : Considering the reality, we believe that, for the same disease and the same classification task, the node representation of the graph obtained from different domains should have a certain consistency.\n \nwhere   is the number of samples in source or target domains. \n\n CORAL Loss   : First, readout graph-level representations of nodes using average pooling and max pooling: \nwhere   denotes concatenation. \n\nMeanwhile, CORAL loss is defined as the covariance distance of the features of source domain and target domain: \nwhere   represents the Frobenius norm. \n\nThe covariance of source domain ( ) or target domain ( ) is: \nwhere   I   is a column vector with all elements 1, and  . \n\n Cross Entropy Loss   . Take the cross entropy loss as the source domain classifier loss. Its objective is to minimize the classification loss of the source domain data when the data label is intact: \nwhere   represents the real category label of the   i  -th graph of source domain, and   represents the label prediction result of the   i  -th graph of source domain. We set two fully connected layers   as the label classifier for the source domain. \n\nFinally, we obtain the overall objective function of model A GCN: \nwhere   and   are hyperparameters used to balance the contribution weights of  ,   and  . \n\n\n\n### 3.3. Implementation \n  \nThe proposed A GCN model is implemented based on PyTorch platform. For fair comparison, we will use the same epoch and learning rate for all involved domain adaptation learning tasks, that is, the epoch is set to 150, the learning rate is 0.0001, and Adam is used as the optimizer to optimize the model. This A GCN is composed of two layers of the graph convolution layer and two layers of the fully connected layer, and the output feature dimensions are set as  . The convolution layer is nonlinearly activated using the ReLU function, and the dropout of the fully connected layer is 0.4. In order to extract more discriminative pathological features and establish a cross-domain classification model with good performance, we divided the model training into two stages. According to Equation ( ), we first pre-train the node representation learning and attention mechanism module for 50 epochs.   is set to 0. Both the hyperparameters   and   are set to 1. In the second stage, the above modules and category classifiers are further jointly trained for 100 epochs through Equation ( ), while both the balance parameters   and   are set to 0.5. \n\n\n\n## 4. Experiments \n  \n### 4.1. Data \n  \nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we use NYU, UM, and UCLA from the public Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) website (  (accessed on 20 September 2022)) to validate our model. Meanwhile, the data from these three sites have also been used by Wang et al. [ ]. Specifically, the NYU site included 164 subjects, including 71 with ASD and 93 with HC. The UM site included 113 subjects, 48 with ASD, and 65 with HC. The UCLA site included 74 subjects, 36 with ASD, and 38 with HC. We built the graph based on these three sites. The phenotypic information of the subjects involved in this study is shown in  . The rs-fMRI data are from the Preprocessed Connectome Project initiative (  (accessed on 20 September 2022)). \n\nRs-fMRI data collected at different sites will be preprocessed by a widely accepted pipeline (the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) [ ]). The steps of preprocessing mainly include: (1) slice timing, head motion correction, (2) nuisance signal regression (ventricular, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter signal, etc.), (3) template spatial standardization of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) [ ], and (4) temporal filtering. Then, we use the classical AAL atlas to divide each subject’s brain into 116 functional regions and extract their average time series. Finally, each subject can generate a corresponding symmetric functional connectivity matrix based on the extracted signals, and the size of the matrix is   (according to Equation ( )). The element of the matrix represents the PC between paired ROIs. \n\n\n### 4.2. Experimental Settings \n  \nIn this study, we will establish a classification model through four cross-site prediction tasks: NYU→UM, NYU→UCLA, UM→NYU, UM→UCLA. The dataset before the arrow is defined as the source domain, and the dataset after the arrow is set as the target domain. The source domain samples all contained complete category labels, while the target domain subjects had no label information. Considering the limited number of samples, we will use all source/target domain samples for training and testing all target domain subjects. In order to make the result more reasonable, we repeat the training process 10 times, and take the mean value and standard deviation of each algorithm as the final result. \n\nIn this study, we will set seven metrics to evaluate the performance of the model, including: Accuracy (ACC), Precision (Pre), Recall (Rec), F1-Score (F1), Balanced accuracy (BAC), Negative predictive value (NPV), and Area under curve (AUC). The greater the value of these indexes, the better the classification performance of the model. These metrics are calculated as follows: ACC =  , Pre =  , Rec =  , NPV =  , BAC =  + , F1 =  . The   TN  ,   TP  ,   FN  , and   FP   represent True Negative, True Positive, False Negative, and False Positive, respectively. \n\n\n### 4.3. Competing Methods \n  \nIn this work, we compare the proposed A GCN with five single-domain models: (1) Degree centrality (  DC  ), (2) Feature fusion using betweenness centrality and degree centrality (  BD  ), (3) Feature fusion using betweenness centrality, degree centrality, and closeness centrality (  BDC  ), (4) Deep neural networks (  DNN  ), and (5) Graph convolutional networks (  GCN  ). At the same time, we compare A GCN with three state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods: (1) Cross-domain model based on multi-layer perceptron (  DNNC  ), (2) Maximum Mean Discrepancy (  MMD  ), and (3) Domain Adversarial Neural Network (  DANN  ). More details of these competing methods are introduced below. \n  \n DC  : This method measures the degree of nodes in the FCNs as the features of subjects. Specifically, according to Equation ( ), for each subject, we can generate FCN of the size of 116 × 116, where each element in FCN is the correlation coefficient between node pairs calculated by PC. First, the degree centrality (DC) indexes of each node in the FCN are calculated. Then, the model DC takes the 116 × 1-dimensional feature vector representation obtained by computing DC for each subject as the input of the SVM classifier. \n  \n BD  : This method combines the betweenness centrality (BC) and DC of nodes as the features of subjects. Based on Equation ( ), the FCN of each subject is obtained, and then the BC and DC of nodes are respectively calculated. The BC and DC are concatenated into 232 × 1-dimensional vectors according to rows, used as the input of SVM. \n  \n BDC  : To mitigate the lack of information or noise pollution caused by manually defined features, we further calculate the BC, DC, and closeness centrality (CC) of the node of each subject FCN. The model BDC is further sequentially splicing the DC, BC, and CC values of each subject to form a feature representation of 348 × 1-dimensional as the input of the SVM classifier. \n  \n DNN  : According to the classical practice, we take the FCN of the subject in the upper triangle and pull it into a vector. In order to prevent dimensional disaster, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm limits the dimension of variables to 64 dimensions. Then, the features after dimensionality reduction are used as the input of model DNN. The model DNN is composed of two fully connected layers, and the output dimension is:  . \n  \n GCN  : GCN can combine the topological structure of the graph to deeply mine the potential information of nodes. Our A GCN is inspired by GCN. Obviously, if we set  , A GCN will crash to GCN. Similar to our proposed A GCN method, first, we construct the source and target graphs, respectively, based on the FCNs of the subjects. Then, based on the source graphs, the cross entropy loss is optimized to train the classification model with good performance. Finally, the GCN model is applied directly to the target graphs to make prediction. The model GCN consists of two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers, and the output dimension is:  . \n  \n DNNC  : We transform our A GCN model feature extractor GCN into multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to construct a simple cross-domain classification model. The model inputs are the same as the settings for the DNN model above. The output dimension of the network is set to  . At the same time, add CORAL loss minimization domain offset. The covariance between the sample features of the source domain and the target domain is defined as CORAL loss. Meanwhile, CORAL loss can minimize the domain offset without additional parameters. This method is basic and efficient, and it is also one of the losses used in our A GCN. \n  \n MMD  : The Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) method aims to reduce differences of the domain distribution by MMD. This deep transfer model uses the GCN as a feature extractor. MAE loss and CORAL loss in our model are replaced by the MMD loss [ ]. Then, the two-layer MLP is used as a category classifier for MMD. The number of neurons in the output layer of convolution layer and fully connected layer is consistent with our A GCN method. The reference code (  (accessed on 20 September 2022)) is publicly available. \n  \n DANN  : The Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) [ ] is a domain adaptive method based on confrontational learning. The DANN method uses a gradient inversion layer (GRL) as   with a reversal gradient   to train a domain classifier. The adaptation parameter   of GRL refers to [ , ]. Here,   x   represents the representation of the extracted graph. The two-layer fully connected layer is used as the domain classifier of DANN to establish the adversarial loss. The hidden layer dimension is set to  ; the dropout is 0.4, and ReLU is responsible for nonlinear activation. Then, the two-layer MLP is used as a category classifier for DANN. Dimensions of the output layer of the convolution layer or fully connected layer are consistent with A GCN. \n  \nNote that the three conventional machine learning methods (i.e., DC, BD, and BDC) and two deep learning methods (i.e., DNN and GCN) are single-domain approaches, while the three deep learning methods (i.e., DNNC, MMD, and DANN) are state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods for cross-domain classification. \n\n\n### 4.4. Results \n  \nThe quantitative results of the A GCN and several competing methods in ASD vs. HC classification will be reported in  . We observe the following interesting findings. \n  \nThe four cross-domain classification models (i.e., DNNC, MMD, DANN, and A GCN) achieved better results in most cases compared with several single-domain classification models (i.e., DC, BDC, DNN, and GCN). This means that the introduction of domain adaptation learning module helps to enhance the classification performance of the model, which may benefit from the transferable feature representation across sites learned by the model. \n  \nGraph-based (i.e., GCN, MMD, DANN, and A GCN)) methods usually produce better classification results than traditional classical methods based on manually defined node features (i.e., DC, BD, and BDC) and network embeddings (i.e., DNN and DNNC). Because these traditional methods only consider the characteristics of nodes, however, those methods that use GCN as feature extractors can update and aggregate the features of nodes on the graph end-to-end with the help of the underlying topology information of FCNs, in order to learn more discriminative node representation, which may be more beneficial for ASD auxiliary diagnosis. \n  \nThe experimental results of the proposed A GCN consistently outperform all competing methods. This indicates that A GCN can achieve effective domain adaptation and reduce data distribution differences, thus improving the robustness of the model. \n  \nCompared with three advanced cross-domain methods (i.e., DNNC, MMD, and DANN), our proposed A GCN method has a competitive advantage in various domain adaptation tasks. This may be because our method adds node attention mechanism modules, which can make intelligent use of different contributions of brain regions. Meanwhile, our method adopts MAE loss and CORAL loss to align different domains step by step. These operations can partially alleviate the negative effects of noisy areas. \n  \n\n### 4.5. Ablation Study \n  \nThe proposed A GCN contains two key components, namely, node attention mechanism module and domain adaptation module. To evaluate the contribution of these two parts, we compare the proposed A GCN with its three variants:   \n A GCN_A  : Similar to the A GCN method, firstly, the source graph and the target graph are respectively constructed based on the subject’s FCNs. Then, the node representation on the source graph is learned based on GCN. At the same time, the node attention mechanism model mentioned in   is added to set different weight values for different nodes/brain regions of the source graph. Then, cross entropy is used to calculate the classification loss. Finally, the model trained in the source domain is applied to the prediction of the target domain graph. \n  \n A GCN_M  : First, based on the subject’s FCNs, the model constructs the source graph and the target graph respectively. Then, according to the node representation learning module in  , the node features on the source graph and the target graph are simultaneously learned based on GCN. Then, the node attention mechanism module in   is added, and the weighted node features are used to calculate the MAE loss between domains (domain adaptation module). Finally, the cross entropy is used to calculate the classification loss. \n  \n A GCN_C  : First, the model uses FCNs to construct source and target graphs. Like A GCN, this model learns the node features of different domains based on GCN according to the node representation learning module in  . Then, after the readout operation, the CORAL loss (domain adaptation module) between domains is calculated based on the extracted graph representation vector. The cross entropy is used to calculate the classification loss of the source domain. \n  \n\nIn  , we report the corresponding ACC and AUC values. As shown in  , we can find that the performance of three variants A GCN_A (without domain adaptation module), A GCN_M (with attention mechanism module and part of domain adaptation module), and A GCN_C (without domain attention mechanism module) are significantly degraded in the corresponding transfer learning task. In particular, A GCN_A achieved the worst performance in most cases. The underlying reason could be that attention mechanisms play a role in extracting more discriminative features. In addition, it also shows that using MAE loss and CORAL loss to align the learned features step by step during training can reduce the data information loss caused by readout-related pooling operations, thus significantly improving the robustness and transmission performance of A GCN. More results on the influence of parameters and model pre-training can be found in  . \n\n\n\n## 5. Discussion \n  \n### 5.1. Visualization of Data Distribution \n  \nTo visually demonstrate the features learned through the proposed A GCN, we use the t-SNE [ ] tool to visualize the data distribution of different imaging sites before and after domain adaptation. In  , the blue and red dots represent the source and target domains, respectively. To visualize the regional heterogeneity before domain adaptation, we flattened the upper triangle of the FCN matrix for each sample of each site. The vector representation is obtained, which is further reduced to 64 dimensions by the PCA method as the original representation of the sample. From  a, we can observe that there is a significant domain shift between the distribution of the source domain and the target domain. We use the t-SNE algorithm to visualize feature distribution of the source and target domains after the feature extractor GCN in different cross-site classification tasks (through A GCN), with results reported in  b. In  b, red and blue dots are closely clustered together. This means that the distributions of the node representations of the two domains learned by our method are close, and the domain heterogeneity has been substantially reduced. At the same time, we calculated the Frobenius norm of the covariance (CF) between samples in the source domain and the target domain, which is used to measure the difference of data distribution between different sites. It is observed that the CF between different sites is significantly reduced after domain adaptation. These results show that A GCN can effectively extract transferable features and reduce domain shift. \n\n\n### 5.2. Most Informative Brain Regions \n  \nOne of the main focuses of this work is to use interpretable deep learning algorithms to discover the underlying differences between ASD and HC subjects. An interesting question is to identify the most informative brain regions for ASD detection. In the task of “NYU→UM”, we randomly select 10 subjects from the UM site. We then extract the features of these subjects after the attention mechanism module, select 19 brain regions with strong correlation, and visualize them using BrainNet [ ] tool, with results shown in  . In  , the color of brain regions is randomly assigned, and the stick-like connections between brain regions indicate strong FC between them. For ASD vs. HC classification, we find that the most informative brain regions include the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, putamen lentiform, and the vicinity of thalamus, which is also consistent with previous studies [ , ]. It validates the potential application value of our model in the discovery of rs-fMRI biomarkers for ASD identification, thus helping to improve the interpretability of learning algorithms in automated brain disease detection. \n\n\n### 5.3. Limitations and Future Work \n  \nAlthough our proposed A GCN method has achieved good results in the prediction of ASD, there is still challenging work to be considered in the future.   First  , in our current work, only knowledge transfer between a single source domain and a target domain is considered. It is also interesting to explore the shared features of multiple source domains to reduce the heterogeneity of data and thus improve the learning performance of the target domain.   Second  , the size of the training sample is relatively small. We hope to add unlabeled samples from other public datasets to assist in pre-training the proposed network in a semi-supervised learning manner, aiming to further improve model generalization capability [ ]. \n\n\n\n## 6. Conclusions \n  \nIn this paper, we construct a multi-site unsupervised rs-fMRI domain adaptation framework (A GCN) with an attention mechanism for ASD diagnosis. The framework automatically extracts rs-fMRI features from brain FCNs with the help of the GCN model. The attention mechanism is used to explore the contribution of different brain regions to the automatic detection of brain diseases and explore the interpretable features of brain regions. In addition, our method explores mean absolute error and covariance-based constraints to alleviate data distribution differences among imaging sites. We evaluate our proposed method using rs-fMRI data from a real multi-site dataset (ABIDE). Experimental results show that the A GCN has significant advantages over several advanced methods. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"7c86e7cd50771e7d088044db6121101c"},

Despite these differences, they can give rise to very similar cognitive impairments, such as specific forms of aphasia. What has been scarcely investigated, however, is the extent to which the underlying functional neuroplastic consequences are similar or different for these diseases. Here, for the first time, we directly compare changes in the brain’s functional network connectivity, measured with resting-state fMRI, in stroke and progressive neurological disease. Specifically, we examined two groups of individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia or non-fluent primary progressive aphasia, matched for their behavioral profiles and distribution of left-hemisphere damage. Using previous proposals regarding the neural functional connectivity (FC) phenotype of stroke as a starting point, we compared the two diseases in terms of homotopic FC, intra-hemispheric FC changes and also the symmetry of the FC patterns between the two hemispheres. We found, first, that progressive disease showed significantly higher levels of homotopic connectivity than neurotypical controls and, further, that stroke showed the reverse pattern. For both groups these effects were found to be behaviorally relevant. In addition, within the directly impacted left hemisphere, FC changes for the two diseases were significantly correlated. In contrast, in the right hemisphere, the FC changes differed markedly between the two groups, with the progressive disease group exhibiting rather symmetrical FC changes across the hemispheres whereas the post-stroke group showed asymmetrical FC changes across the hemispheres. These findings constitute novel evidence that the functional connectivity consequences of stroke and neurodegenerative disease can be very different despite similar behavioral outcomes and damage foci. Specifically, stroke may lead to greater independence of hemispheric responses, while neurodegenerative disease may produce more symmetrical changes across the hemispheres and more synchronized activity between the two hemispheres. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nStroke and neurodegenerative disease differ in terms of several key neurological features and yet they can have remarkably similar cognitive/behavioral consequences ( ). This observation raises a number of questions about the neural consequences of the two diseases, including: Do stroke and neurodegenerative disease produce similar functional neuroplastic changes? Given the open-ended nature of this question and that fact that there have been no previous studies comparing these diseases, in this study, we use, as a starting point, the work of Siegel et al ( ) who, . on the basis of a large-scale investigation of inter and intra-hemispheric functional connectivity patterns in sub-acute stroke, proposed a “general physiological network phenotype of stroke”.  The proposed phenotype consisted of two key features: (a) decreased inter-hemispheric functional connectivity between homotopic regions and (b) increased intra-hemispheric functional connectivity between normally segregated functional networks in the ipsi-lesional hemisphere. In the work we report on here, we evaluate the hypothesis that stroke and neurodegenerative disease differ with regard to these network phenotypic features. This hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that, despite often producing similar cognitive/behavioral patterns, the different underlying neurological features of the two diseases, including their different temporal disease trajectories (abrupt onset versus gradual progression), may produce significantly different disease-specific neuroplastic changes. To examine the hypothesis of differential functional response patterns in stroke and neurodegenerative disease, we specifically evaluated functional connectivity in two groups of individuals with aphasia subsequent to stroke (post-stroke aphasia, PSA) and progressive neurological disease (non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia, PPA) who shared similar behavioral/cognitive profiles and distributions of left hemisphere damage. \n\n### Consequences of stroke and neurodegenerative disease for functional connectivity \n  \nThe   stroke phenotype proposal was based on the analysis of resting-state fMRI data collected from a cohort of 100 individuals with sub-acute stroke and heterogenous behavioral deficits (including a subset of 33 individuals with aphasia). They examined interhemispheric homotopic functional connectivity (FC) as well as ipsi- and contra-lesional within and between network FC. In a previous study of FC in chronic post-stroke aphasia (PSA),   found strong support for the claim of reduced inter-hemisphere homotopic FC, based on task-based background connectivity measures. The claim of reduced inter-hemispheric FC in PSA also found support in findings reported in  . Furthermore, it is generally consistent with findings from research indicating that the two hemispheres may respond very differently in PSA ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). However, with regard to the second proposed phenotype feature of increased intra-hemispheric FC,   reported that that the patterns of intra-hemispheric FC in PSA that they observed were variable between and across functional networks and, therefore, that intra-hemispheric FC patterns defied a simple phenotypic characterization (see also  ). \n\nWith regard to primary progressive aphasia (PPA), the issues of FC lateralization and hemispheric symmetry or synchronization have not been previously directly examined. However, for non-fluent PPA, there are reports of FC changes in the right hemisphere that mirror those seen in the left hemisphere, despite the right hemisphere being relatively intact structurally ( ,  ), indirectly suggesting increased inter-hemispheric FC symmetry in PPA. If verified under direct examination, this pattern would be contrary to the results that have been reported for stroke. With regard to intra-hemispheric FC in PPA, both decreased and elevated FC have been found and there are both variant-specific and variant independent effects ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). However, direct comparisons of intra-hemispheric FC in PSA and PPA using the same analysis approaches would be required in order to understand if and how these complex patterns are similar across these diseases. \n\n\n### Temporal dynamics of disease trajectory \n  \nNeurological conditions may differ along a number of dimensions with a salient one being their temporal trajectories, with some, such as stroke or hypoxia, typically having abrupt onsets while others, such neurodegenerative diseases and slow-growing tumors, having a gradual progression. Although understanding the brain’s neuroplastic responses to these temporal differences is of great interest, their effects have been scarcely investigated. \n\nPrevious research has provided clear evidence of the relevance of the temporal characteristics of lesion for overall recovery of function. Studies comparing behavioral recovery in rats subjected to successive resections varying in the number of stages and inter-lesion intervals have consistently shown that more gradual lesions were associated with better functional recovery ( ,  ). A review ( ) of human studies of progressive damage (slow growing tumors) and acute damage (stroke) confirmed that gradually progressing damage generally yielded better cognitive outcomes and produced more neurotopographically distributed re-organization. These authors suggested that, with regard to the latter, progressive neurological diseases may parallel the effects of aging. \n\nThis investigation provides an opportunity to compare the consequences of diseases that vary starkly in terms of their temporal trajectories, and hence will shed light on the relevance of disease kinetics to functional neuroplasticity as well as on the possible relationship between FC patterns in neurodegenerative disease and aging. However, because the two diseases also differ along other dimensions that cannot be controlled, it will not be possible to definitely determine that the differences in temporal diseases trajectories are the source of FC differences that are documented. We return to these issues in the General Discussion. \n\n\n### The current study \n  \nEmpirical and computational work has shown that, when subjected to damage, the human connectome undergoes a complex and dynamic series of neuroplastic changes. ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). While understanding the differential effects of different neurological diseases is clearly of great importance, inferences have been severely limited by enormous inter-study variability in neural measures and analytic approaches. To address this issue, we directly compared individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA, non-fluent variant) and post-stroke aphasia (PSA) who exhibited highly similar language phenotypes (see  ) and distributions of left-hemisphere damage. We specifically evaluated functional connectivity as indexed by the correlation of intrinsic brain activity (measured in task-free, resting-state fMRI) between pairs of brain regions. Using the   stroke phenotype proposal as a starting point, we examined functional connectivity (FC) changes in these two groups (compared to healthy controls) in terms of the two proposed stroke phenotype features. On that basis, in Analysis 1, we examined inter-hemispheric homotopic FC while, in Analysis 2a, we examined intra-hemisphere FC. In Analysis 2b, we carried out a more extensive evaluation of intra-hemispheric FC changes, directly comparing the FC changes of the two neuropathological groups with four different FC measures that evaluate functional integration/segregation at both global and local scales. Finally, in Analysis 3, we examined the degree of similarity in the patterns of intra-hemispheric FC changes between the two hemispheres, i.e., hemispheric symmetry, experienced by the two groups. The results of the full set of analyses provide novel evidence of both similar and different patterns of functional neuroplastic changes in the two groups, expanding our understanding of the possible phenotypic features of stroke and neurodegenerative disease. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants include 55 individuals with stroke or neurodegenerative disease and 41 healthy older controls. The neuropathological group included 25 individuals with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) who had suffered a single left-hemisphere stroke at least six months prior to the investigation. The PSA data used for this study were collected at the pre-treatment timepoint of a larger study of post-stroke language rehabilitation clinical trial (NCT01927302). Data of 30 individuals with non-fluent primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) were also collected at the pre-treatment timepoint from recruited for a clinical trial (NCT02606422). These participants were diagnosed with non-fluent PPA based on neuropsychological and language testing, structural MRI, and clinical assessment, according to consensus criteria ( ) and had a history of progressive language deficits without primary memory deficits or other etiology (e.g., stroke, tumors, etc.). The two neuropathological groups were comparable in terms of years of education, gender, and aphasia profiles ( ). Participants in the PPA group tended to be older than those in the PSA group and, therefore, to verify that the results obtained were not due to age differences between the groups, we repeated all analyses between age-matched groups that excluded the 7 younger stroke participants and 13 younger controls (≤55 yo). Results obtained with these age-matched subgroups were comparable to those obtained with the full groups and are reported in  s 6. The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board. All participants provided informed consent.   \nDemographic information and language and cognitive assessment results. If different tests were administered to the PPA and PSA participants, the test names are presented as (PPA/PSA). Behavioral assessment results are presented as percentage accuracy unless otherwise noted. Standard deviation values are shown in parentheses. Norm values are shown in each cell in italics when available. \n                  \n\n\n### MRI image acquisition \n  \nAll MRI data were collected using a Phillips 3T scanner at the F.M. Kirby Research Center for Functional Brain Imaging (Baltimore, MD). Similar standard parameters for the resting-state fMRI and T1-weighted structural imaging were used across the groups. For the PPA group, the scanning protocol included one session of resting-state (8.75 min) and multiple structural scanning protocols, including T1-weighted structural imaging. The acquisition parameters for the rs-fMRI were as follows: TR: 2500 ms, TE: 30 ms, FOV: 240*141*240 mm (ap, fh, rl), flip angle 75 degrees, voxel dimension: 3*3*3 mm, data matrix: 80*80*47. The T1-weighted structural MRI acquisition parameters were as follows: TR: 8.1 ms, TE: 3.7 ms, FOV: 224*160*180 mm (ap, fh, rl), flip angle: 8 degrees, voxel dimension: 1*1*1 mm, data matrix: 224*224*160. For the PSA group, the protocol included two 7-minute runs of rs-fMRI carried out consecutively, with the following acquisition parameters: TR: 2400 ms, TE: 20 ms, FOV: 206*123*220 mm (ap, fh, rl), flip angle: 90 degrees, voxel dimension: 1.7*1.7*3 mm, data matrix: 128*128*41. The T1-weighted structural MRI acquisition parameters were as follows: TR: 6 ms, TE: 2.9 ms, FOV: 256*256*176 mm (ap, fh, rl), flip angle: 9 degrees, voxel dimension: 1*1*1 mm, data matrix: 256*256*176. \n\nTwenty of the age-matched control participants were scanned with the PPA group’s protocol and 21 with the PSA group’s protocol and the two subgroups were combined to maximize sample size. However, we also repeated the analyses including the scanning protocol as a covariate and, despite this reduction in power, obtained comparable outcomes (see  s 7). \n\n\n### Quantifying structural damage \n  \nFor each PPA and PSA participant, a summary statistic of the total amount of structural damage was calculated to examine whether functional connectivity abnormalities identified in subsequent analyses were related to total structural damage. For each PPA participant, the total structural damage was indexed by the inverse of global gray matter volume calculated as the total gray matter volume divided by intracranial size using tissue segmentation results of FSL. For each PSA participant, as an index of structural damage we used the stroke lesion volume which was calculated as size of the lesion mask co-registered to standard MNI space. The lesion of each PSA participant was manually traced on their T1 images with T2-weighted FLAIR images used to improve tracing accuracy. These lesion masks were then co-registered into standard space using the transformation parameters calculated from the T1 images. \n\nWe also examined the spatial distribution of gray matter atrophy of the PPA group using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis carried out with FSLVBM ( ) following the standard workflow. Specifically, the PPA group was compared to the 20 controls who were scanned with the same MPRAGE protocol as the PPA group (see   Participants  ). Comparisons were conducted using a permutation-based voxel-wise GLM in FSLVBM with isotropic Gaussian kernel (sigma = 3 mm) spatial smoothing, including age and year of education as covariates. Voxel-wise results were corrected for multiple comparisons with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE). \n\nIn addition, to consider possible effects of gray matter atrophy in the PSA group, we also evaluated gray matter volume in PSA using the same methods as were used with the PPA group described above, but excluding lesioned areas. Details of the VBM analysis are described in  a global atrophy value was calculated for each PSA participant as the inverse of total gray matter volume divided by intracranial size using tissue segmentation results of FSL, with lesion volume excluded from both. \n\n#### Resting-state functional MRI data pre-processing and connectome construction \n  \n##### Preprocessing \n  \nResting-state fMRI data were preprocessed using FSL 5.0 as follows: motion correction with MCFLIRT, slice-timing correction, non-brain tissue removal with BET, spatial smoothing using a 5 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, grand-mean intensity normalization, high-pass temporal filtering (0.01 Hz). In FSL, functional images were first registered to a subject’s T1 image using boundary-based registration, then to standard MNI space. For the PSA participants, the stroke lesions were masked out during co-registration. A number of independent components were estimated by MELODIC in FSL to be used as confound variables when calculating FC (see the next section). Each participant’s in-scanner motion was quantified by the root-mean-square (rms) value calculated by MCFLIRT and used as a confound variable in group comparisons. \n\n\n##### Estimating functional connectivity (FC) \n  \nFor all analyses, functional connectivity (FC) was calculated using the preprocessed time-series co-registered to MNI space. The following confound variables were regressed out from the time-series: 12 motion parameters, averaged time-series of the white matter and the CSF segmented by FAST in FSL, and the first three MELODIC independent components that were identified as motion-related by AROMA ( ) together with visual inspection (see   for summary of the MELODIC and AROMA results). FC values were then estimated with Pearson’s correlation (with Fisher’s z-transform). The functional connectomes across multiple runs for a participant were averaged. The analyses were conducted using the Python package   Nilearn   ( ). \n\n Inter-hemispheric, homotopic FC (Analysis 1).   For evaluating homotopic functional connectivity, we used the AICHA atlas (  Atlas of Intrinsic Homotopic Areas,  ) that was specifically developed to study homotopic FC and included 174 pairs of homotopic cortical parcels. For each PSA participant, voxels within the stroke lesion mask were excluded prior to calculating FC. Additionally, for each PSA participant, parcels with >75 % overlap with their lesion mask were excluded from subsequent statistical analyses. Across the 174 homotopic connections no individual connections were excluded from the statistical analyses, but for any given connection the number of excluded participants ranged from 0 to 12 (mean = 1.8+/-2.7), with the Rolandic Opercular Gyrus being the most lesioned. This resulting in only modest variability in degrees of freedom across connections. \n\n Intra-hemisphere FC (Analysis 2).   For these analyses, we constructed whole-brain connectomes using the Power atlas ( ) that consisted of 235 cortical 5 mm-radius nodes (subcortical and cerebellar nodes were excluded for the current study). For each participant, nodes with >50 % overlap with their lesion and/or CSF mask were excluded, resulting in 181–234 total nodes per individual in the PSA group and 224–235 for individuals in the PPA group. Note that as for the homotopic FC, all nodes were included in the group analysis with only the degrees of freedom varying slightly across the nodes. \n\n Connectomes for evaluating the hemispheric symmetry of FC changes (Analysis 3).   The analysis goal was to evaluate the degree to which the patterns of within-hemispheric FC changes, identified in Analysis 2, were similar (symmetrical) in the two hemispheres. However, since the Power atlas did not have a 1–1- correspondence of nodes in the two hemispheres, for each node in each hemisphere (from the Analysis 2 connectome), we generated a node at its mirror location in the opposite hemisphere, resulting in a connectome with a total of 235 pairs of symmetrical nodes. No nodes were excluded from the group analysis but after considering lesioned/atrophic tissue, there were a total of 357–469 nodes per individual in the PSA group and 445–470 for those in the PPA group. \n\n\n\n\n### Analysis 1: Comparison of the functional connectivity between homotopic regions for the PPA and PSA groups \n  \nLower than normal homotopic FC has been shown to be a salient FC feature in stroke ( ,  ). Here we examined homotopic FC in the post-stroke aphasia (PSA) and PPA groups to investigate if PPA exhibited the same characteristics as PSA. First, we compared the average homotopic FC strength across all 174 cortical pairs of homotopic regions from the AICHA atlas between each neuropathological group and the control group. Second, for each neuropathological group, we characterized the spatial distribution of the homotopic FC changes across the brain by comparing the FC strength of each homotopic connection with those of healthy controls. Third, to examine the behavioral relevance of the homotopic FC changes, we evaluated their relationship with behavioral measures of language and executive functioning. For the latter analysis, we calculated an average homotopic FC change value for each participant in each group by averaging the FC change values for the abnormal homotopic connections identified from the previous step. As an overall indicator of language performance we used the language sub-score of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR,  ) for the PPA group and the WABAQ ( ) for the PSA group. To index executive functioning, we used the Trail Making Test (A + B,   Army Individual Test  ) for the PPA group and the Raven’s Progressive Matrices ( ) for the PSA group, a test that heavily relies on working memory and cognitive control ( ,  ,  ). Additionally, we also examined more specific language tasks including naming, digit span forward and backward, and repetition. \n\nThe between-group comparisons were carried out with linear regression with Group as an independent variable and amount of in-scanner motion as the covariate. The connection-wise results were corrected for the 174 homotopic connections using the FDR correction (  alpha < 0.05  ). For the evaluation of the relationship between homotopic FC changes and behavior, regression analyses were carried out in which each participant’s average FC strength was predicted by the behavioral scores of language and executive function tasks described above, with amount of structural damage and in-scanner motion included as covariates. The regression analyses were carried out with the   lm   function in R. \n\n\n### Analysis 2. Comparison of intra-hemisphere functional connectivity changes for the PPA and PSA groups \n  \n#### Analysis 2a. Connection-based comparisons \n  \nAs discussed in the Introduction, higher than normal intra-hemisphere FC has been argued to be another phenotype feature of stroke ( ), though considerable variability across different intra-hemisphere connections has been reported. To examine this, we first conducted an analysis of all individual connections to obtain a panoramic view of the intra-hemisphere FC changes; we refer to this as a “connection-based” analysis. To do so, for each intra-hemispheric connection we compared FC strength for the PSA and PPA groups with the control group using independent t-tests. For the Power atlas, there are 6327 connections within the left-hemisphere, and 7625 within the right hemisphere. The results were FDR corrected for the total 13,952 connections (alpha < 0.05). \n\n\n#### Analysis 2b. Nodal global and local properties \n  \nFor a more in-depth comparison of the FC changes between the two neuropathological groups, we focused on nodal properties (i.e., FC properties of each brain region/node). We used nodal values, rather than connection-based values, because a nodal scale of data compression represents an intermediate level of granularity that preserves information for each brain region while also providing reasonable interpretability. For example, a nodal-based analysis allows one to see quite easily which regions are driving the dis/similarity between the two groups. Specifically, we examined four different nodal measures, two based on mean FC strength and two graph-theoretic measures, thus providing two measures of FC properties at both global and local scales. \n\n\n\n### Measuring nodal FC properties:   Between-   and   within-network Mean-FC  \n  \nFirst, for each node, we calculated its   mean-FC   strength as the average FC of its connections with other nodes. Moreover, as the resting-state functional connectome is known to consist of multiple functional networks, we separated each node’s connections into   within-   and   between-network   connections based on a reference network organization identified with 38 older participants (>50 yo, mean age = 65+/-10) from a publicly available dataset NKI-Rockland ( , see   for details). As depicted in  a, the reference organization consisted of 6 networks that we refer to, based on their neuroanatomical distribution, as: Occipital, Dorsal Frontoparietal (dFP), Perisylvian, Frontoparietal (FP), Temporal, and Default Mode Network (DMN). With the reference network, we calculated one global and one local   mean-FC   measure for each node: the   global, between-network   mean-FC value of a node corresponded to the mean FC of the connections between the node and every other node outside its own network (global FC); The   local, within-network   mean-FC value corresponded to the mean FC of a node’s connections with all other nodes within its own network (local FC) (see   for a schematic illustration of the FC measures). Note that we calculated mean-FC strength values by averaging both positive and negative FC values. We did so because there is no clear consensus in the literature on the best approach for dealing with negative FC values and averaging is a very common approach. Additionally, this approach was consistent with the empirical observation that, in this data set, the negative FC values were overall lower in magnitude than the positive ones (for details, see SFig. 14).   \nThe reference functional network organization and the analysis flow. (A) Six bilateral resting-state functional networks identified with an independent control group (see   Methods: Analysis 2b  ). This served as the reference network organization used for calculating   between-/within-  network FC in subsequent analyses. (B) Analysis flow for the nodal measures. For comparing the FC changes between the two neuropathological groups (Analysis 2b) and for examining hemispheric symmetry of the two groups (Analysis 3), for each nodal measure, values from the PPA/PSA groups were first compared to the healthy controls to obtain a nodal   t  -map for each group that represented its FC changes relative to normal FC levels. Those nodal FC   t  -maps served as the bases for Analyses 2b and 3. A high correlation between the nodal t-values indicates that the two groups show high similarity in their FC changes (Analysis 2b) or that the two hemispheres have a high degree of symmetry (Analysis 3). \n  \n\n\n### Measuring nodal FC properties: Graph-theoretic measures \n  \nFor each node, we also evaluated one global and one local   graph-theoretic measure  .   Global efficiency   (GE) is the inverse of the average   shortest path length   of a node (this is also known as   closeness  ). A node that is functionally connected to all other nodes via only a few connections will have a low   average shortest path length   and hence a high GE value.   Clustering coefficient   (CC) is a local measure of a node’s “cliqueness”, such that a CC value of 1 indicates that all of the node’s neighbors are also connected to each other (see   for a schematic illustration of the two graph-theoretic measures). Note that, unlike the mean FC measures described just above, both graph-theoretic measures are calculated independently of the reference network organization and, thus, can be considered to be “model free”. \n\nAll graph-theoretic analyses were carried out with the Python-version of the   brain-connectivity-toolbox (   ).   The graph-theoretic metrics were calculated at a series of proportional density threshold values (10 % to 40 % with 5 % increments) and binarized graphs were used to calculate each metric. For each node, the values obtained for the different density thresholds were then averaged before entering them into subsequent statistical analyses ( ). Because GE can be sensitive to differences in the numbers of nodes ( ) across participants due to damage, we used   normalized GE   calculated relative to 10 random networks with preserved degree distribution (hereafter, we refer to it simply as GE). Since CC has not been shown to be sensitive to number of nodes ( ) it was not normalized. \n\n\n### Comparison of within-hemisphere patterns of FC changes for the PPA and PSA groups \n  \nFirst, we calculated the FC changes for each neuropathological group by comparing their FC values to those of the control group. For each of the four measures described above, the nodal values of each neuropathological group were compared to the control group using linear regression with Group as an independent variable and amount of in-scanner motion as the covariate, generating a whole-brain, nodal   t  -map for each neuropathological group that represented differences between that group and the control group. We will refer to the differences in FC between each neuropathological group and the control group as   FC changes   and to the nodal   t  -maps that represent them as   FC-change maps.   We then examined how similar the two groups’ overall FC changes were by correlating (Pearson’s r) their FC-change maps within each hemisphere separately (See  b for illustration of this analysis). These correlations were calculated for each of the four FC measures and their statistical significance was evaluated with 10 K permutation testing. Results were further Bonferroni corrected for the 8 comparisons (4 measures*2 hemispheres). \n\n\n### Analysis 3: Comparison of the hemispheric symmetry of FC changes for the PPA and PSA groups \n  \nLastly, we examined the degree of similarity between the two hemispheres’ FC changes for both the PPA and PSA groups. For each PPA and PSA participant, we calculated a   LH-RH change symmetry   score for each of the four FC measures as follows: For each node, we first computed its z-score against the control group value, then we correlated (Pearson’s r) the z-scores between the 235 homologues nodes in the left and the right hemisphere to obtain a participant-specific   LH-RH change symmetry   score for each of the four FC measures (See  b for illustration of this analysis). Scores for the PPA and PSA groups were compared with linear regression with Group as an independent variable and in-scanner motion included as a covariate. Results were Bonferroni corrected for the four FC measures. \n\nBecause the hemispheric   symmetry change score   values were based on the FC change values (i.e., z-scores), they indexed the symmetry of the FC changes relative to the neurotypical controls. In addition, therefore, we also examined the raw FC symmetry using the original nodal FC values for each participant and compared the values of each neuropathological group to the control group. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral assessment \n  \nThe results of comprehensive language and cognitive assessments are reported in  . It is noteworthy that the two neuropathological groups presented with quite similar language deficit profiles. Namely, both groups showed moderate impairment in spoken naming, auditory sentence comprehension, repetition, spelling, while lexical semantic knowledge was relatively intact. \n\n\n### Structural damage \n  \nThe PPA group exhibited the typical pattern of left hemisphere gray matter atrophy seen in non-fluent PPA involving primarily the posterior frontal and the anterior parietal lobes and the insula ( ). The structural damage of the PSA group (measured in terms of lesioned voxels) followed the typical pattern of MCA stroke with damage also concentrated in posterior frontal and parietal lobes and the insula ( ). The PSA group also showed some grey matter atrophy primarily in the cerebellum and in subcortical regions bilaterally ( ), and the gray matter atrophy (inverse of gray matter volume) in the RH showed a marginal relationship with lesion volume and (r = 0.3, p = 0.1) and a strong relationship with age (r = 0.53, p = 0.004).   \nStructural damage of the primary progressive aphasia (PPA, non-fluent variant) and the post-stroke aphasia (PSA) groups. Top: gray matter atrophy of the PPA group calculated by voxel-based morphometry analysis compared to the healthy controls. Whole-brain results were corrected with the Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement method (corrected p < 0.01). Bottom: Lesion overlap of the 25 PSA participants, color scale indicates number of participants. Voxels that were damaged in more than one third of the group (n > 8) are shown. \n  \n\n\n### Analysis 1: PPA and PSA showed different inter-hemispheric homotopic functional connectivity changes \n  \nThe examination of the FC strength of 173 cortical homotopic pairs based on the AICHA atlas revealed that, on average, the PSA group’s homotopic connectivity values were significantly lower than controls (  t = -4.42, p = 2.71e-5  ) consistent with the “stroke phenotype” reported in previous studies ( ; Joshua Sarfaty  ,  ). Conversely, the PPA group showed higher homotopic FC values than the control group (  PPA: t = 3.9, p = 0.0002;  a). In other words, for the PSA group, activity across homotopic regions were less synchronized than in neurotypical controls and for the PPA group, the reverse pattern was observed. Furthermore, the distributions of abnormal homotopic FC connections were also very distinct for the two groups with a more widespread and more anterior distribution in PPA and a more posterior and lateral distribution in PSA ( b).   \nInter-hemispheric homotopic functional connectivity changes for the two neuropathological groups (Analysis 1). (A) Average homotopic FC strength across the173 homotopic connections from the AICHA atlas ( ). Relative to the healthy control group, values for the PPA group were significantly higher, while PSA values were significantly lower.   ****:p < 0.0001, ***:p < 0.001   (B) PSA and PPA group comparisons with FC values for each homotopic connection. Significant effects are depicted (FDR corrected, alpha < 0.05). Positive   t  -values indicate PPA/PSA group values that were greater than those of the control group (red) and negative   t  -values (blue) indicate PPA/PSA group values that were lower than those of the control group. Node size and edge thickness are proportional to the   t  -values. For the PPA and PSA groups, not only were the FC changes in opposite directions but, furthermore, the two groups also exhibited different neurotopographic distributions of their abnormal homotopic connections. (C) Relationship between homotopic FC (average values per participant across all significant homotopic connections) and behavioral scores for the PPA group. Left: CDR-language ( ), x-axis indicates inverse severity score (i.e., higher values indicate better language performance). Left: Executive function as measured by Trail Making Test (A + B), x-axis indicates inverse reaction time in millisecond (i.e., higher values, faster reaction time - better performance); (D) Relationship between homotopic FC (average values per participant across all significant homotopic connections) and behavioral scores for the PSA group. Left: Overall language performance measured by WAB-AQ ( ). Right: Executive function measured by Raven’s Progressive Matrices (Raven, 1938). For both tests, higher values indicate better performance. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  \n\nTo determine if these homotopic FC patterns had any behavioral relevance, we examined their relationship with behavioral measures. Because the two neuropathological groups were recruited for different studies, they shared few behavioral tests. We thought it could nonetheless be useful to consider two broad cognitive areas that were assessed in both groups (albeit with different specific tests): executive functioning and language. For the PPA group, who had overall higher-than-normal (elevated) homotopic FC values, for the significantly abnormal connections (shown in  b), higher average homotopic FC values were found to be correlated with lower executive performance (longer Trail reaction times, p = 0.0065), but uncorrelated with language proficiency (CDR-language p = 0.72,  c). Similar to the findings based on the CDR-language scores, scores from other language tasks (i.e., repetition, naming) were not correlated with the abnormal homotopic FC (see  ). In contrast, for the PSA group, who had overall lower-than-normal homotopic FC values, for the significantly abnormal connections, higher average FC values were correlated with better language performance (WABAQ p = 0.0077) but were uncorrelated with executive functioning scores (Raven: p = 0.52,  D). The other language tasks (i.e., repetition, naming) showed similar effects as the WABAQ ( ). Additionally, the total amount of structural damage was uncorrelated with abnormal homotopic FC for either group (PPA atrophy: p = 0.27; PSA lesion volume: p = 0.27, atrophy of RH: p = 0.27). Detailed statistics of these analyses are reported in  . \n\nIn sum, although homotopic FC patterned in opposite directions for the two groups (abnormally high in PPA and abnormally low in PSA), for both groups better behavioral performance was associated with closer-to-normal levels of homotopic FC. Furthermore, the abnormal homotopic FC values showed behavioral relevance that was consistent with their anatomical distribution—medial frontal homotopic abnormalities in PPA were associated with executive processing performance and lateral temporal/parietal homotopic abnormalities in PSA were associated with language performance. The fact that these strikingly different FC patterns were associated with different cognitive functions in the two groups despite their overall similarity in terms of left hemisphere damage distribution and language profiles will be discussed in the General Discussion. \n\n\n### Analysis 2a. Intra-hemispheric functional connectivity changes in PPA and PSA \n  \nThis analysis examined connection-based changes of intra-hemispheric FC for each neuropathological group. As depicted in  , for both PPA and PSA, we observed both increased and decreased FC relative to the controls. For PPA, while there were many more connections with decreased compared to increased FC across the brain (286 vs 46), the numbers of decreased/increased connections were similar for the two hemispheres (decreased: 152 LH, 134 RH; increased: 46 LH, 61RH). The PSA group exhibited a more similar total number of increased and decreased connection (70 vs 51) but there was a striking hemispheric difference such that decreased FC connections were heavily concentrated in the left-hemisphere and increased FC connections were largely in the right-hemisphere ( . decreased: 63 LH, 7 RH; increased: 19 LH, 32RH). Overall, these results do not provide clear support for the proposed “stroke phenotype” feature of increased ipsi-lesional FC, since for the PSA group the FC increases were concentrated in the RH and for the PPA group they are distributed similarly across both hemispheres. Furthermore, both groups also exhibited large numbers of connections with reduced FC values .   \nIntra-hemisphere, connection-wise functional connectivity (FC) changes of the PPA (top) and the PSA group (bottom). Significant effects are depicted (FDR corrected, alpha < 0.05) and the decreased (blue, negative   t  -values against controls) and increased connections (red, positive   t  -values against controls) are showed separately. Node size is proportional to the node’s (absolute)   t  -value sum. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  \n\nWe also examined whether the abnormal intra-hemispheric FC values (separately analyzing the elevated and reduced values for each group) were related to the amount of structural damage in each hemisphere respectively. We found that, for PPA, the abnormal FC values were not related to amount of atrophy in either hemisphere (see Table S3). For PSA, we observed that reduced FC in the RH was related to greater RH atrophy (r = −0.45), and no significant correlations were found with lesion volume (see Table S3). \n\n\n### Analysis 2b. PPA and PSA groups show similar FC changes in the left but not the right hemisphere \n  \nAs already indicated, for comparing the FC changes between the two neuropathological groups, we used nodal-level measures because this granularity offers better interpretability than connection-based values.   reports the unthresholded FC-change maps (  t  -value maps) for all four FC measures for the PPA and the PSA groups. Various patterns of between-group and between-hemisphere similarities in terms of FC changes are apparent from visual inspection, and these were then evaluated in the subsequent statistical analyses. For completeness, we also included visualizations of thresholded maps of the FC-change values in the  s (SFig. 15, FDR correction, alpha = 0.1).   \nFC-change maps for the four FC measures examined. Nodes correspond to those in the Power atlas ( ) and results are depicted on a glass brain. Color scale indicates   t  -values comparing PPA/PSA groups to the control group on each the four FC measures. Positive values (red) indicate PPA/PSA group values were greater than the control group and negative values (blue) indicate they were lower than control values. (A)-(B):   T  -value maps of the PPA/PSA groups vs controls for the global connectivity measures of mean   between-network   FC and   global efficiency   (GE); (C)-(D)   T  -value maps of PPA/PSA groups vs controls for the local connectivity measures of mean   within-network   FC and   clustering coefficient   (CC). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  \n\n\n### Global connectivity:   Between-network   mean-FC and   global efficiency   (GE) \n  \nFor global FC measures, the correlation of the   t  -values for the two neuropathological groups (differences from controls) revealed very different FC change patterns for the two hemispheres ( a-b). In the LH, the values for both global FC measures were highly correlated across the groups (  mean-FC: r = 0.68, corrected-p < 0.0001, GE: r = 0.70, corrected-p < 0.0001  ). In contrast the correlations for the two groups in the RH were significantly weaker for both measures (  mean-FC: r = 0.32, corrected-p = 0.0024, LH   vs   RH p = 0.0027; GE: r = 0.30, corrected-p = 0.0032, LH   vs   RH p = 0.0018  ).   \nComparison of the two neuropathological groups in terms of intra-hemispheric FC changes. For each hemisphere and each of the four FC measures, each scatterplot represents the correlation between PSA and PPA groups of their nodal   t  -values (that index each node’s FC change relative to the control group). Note that these nodal   t  -values are the same values as reported in  . A high correlation value indicates highly similar nodal FC changes for the two groups, for a given hemisphere. The four histograms represent the results of the permutation tests evaluating the differences between the left and right hemisphere correlation values, for each of the four FC measures. Each histogram corresponds to the null distribution of differences between the LH and RH correlation values obtained from 10 K permutation test based on random shuffling of nodes across hemispheres. Dashed lines indicate the observed difference between the left and right hemisphere correlation values. (A)-(B) For each hemisphere, the correlation between PPA and PSA groups of nodal   t  -values for   between-network   mean-FC and   global efficiency   (GE). (C)-(D) For each hemisphere, the correlation between PPA and PSA groups of nodal   t  -values for   within-network   mean-FC and   clustering coefficient   (CC). Permutation testing shows that, for all FC measures except for CC, the correlation of FC values between the two groups in the LH was significantly higher than in the RH.   **:p < 0.01, ****:p < 1e-4 after Bonferroni correction.  \n  \n\n\n### Local connectivity: Within-network FC and clustering coefficient (CC) \n  \nAnalyses revealed that for mean within-network FC, as reported above for   global connectivity and between network mean FC  , changes in the LH of the two groups were significantly and positively correlated whereas the RH values were not (LH:   r = 0.40, corrected-p < 0.0001;   RH:   r = 0.02, corrected-p > 1, LH   vs   RH: p = 0.0021.  ). For the graph-theoretic measure CC, the two groups’ values were significantly positively correlated in both the LH and RH and there was no significant difference between the hemispheric values (LH:   r = 0.41, corrected-p < 0.0001:   RH:   r = 0.38, corrected-p < 0.0001 = 0.0024, LH   vs   RH: p = 0.42  ). \n\nIn sum, for three of the four nodal measures we examined, PPA and PSA groups showed significantly more similar FC changes in the LH than in the RH. The results indicated that individuals with PPA and PSA underwent quite similar FC changes in the LH, whereas in the relatively intact RH, the FC changes of the two groups diverged. \n\n\n### Analysis 3. Hemispheric FC symmetry: The PPA group showed greater symmetry than the PSA group \n  \nIn this analysis, we evaluated the hemispheric symmetry of the FC changes, i.e., the extent to which changes in the two hemispheres mirrored each other in PPA and PSA. The analysis results show that, for each of the four FC measures,   LH-RH change symmetry scores  , calculated from nodal z-scores for each participant, were significantly higher for the PPA than the PSA group ( .   Bonferroni corrected p-values: Global: between-network FC: corrected-p = 0.0024; GE: corrected-p = 2.8e-06; Local: within-network FC: corrected-p = 4.2e-5; CC: corrected-p = 0.0008  ). In addition, these symmetry scores were not related to the extent of total structural damage (  Global: between-network FC: PPA r = 0.13, p = 0.49, PSA lesion r = 0.11, p = 0.61, PSA atrophy: r = 0.05, p = 0.81; GE: PPA r = 0.1, p = 0.6, PSA r = 0.09, p = 0.68, PSA atrophy: r = 0.05, p = 0.8; Local: within-network FC: PPA r = 0.11, p = 0.57, PSA r = 0.22, p = 0.29, PSA atrophy: r = 0.17, p = 0.42; CC: PPA r = −0.04, p = 0.84, PSA r = 0.17, p = 0.41, PSA atrophy: r = 0.18, p = 0.38. p-values not corrected  ). In sum, the PPA group showed more symmetrical FC changes than did the PSA group.   \nHemispheric symmetry of intra-hemispheric FC changes (relative to controls) for PPA and PSA (Analysis 3). LH-RH symmetry scores were calculated using nodal z-scores for each participant (see text for details) and values between the two neuropathological groups were compared. (A)-(B) LH-RH symmetry in global connectivity changes measured by mean   between-network   FC and   global efficiency   (GE). (C)-(D) LH-RH symmetry in local connectivity changes measured by mean   within-network   FC and c  lustering coefficient   (CC). Across all the measures, the PPA group showed significantly greater similarity across the hemispheres than the PSA group, indicating that the FC changes (relative to controls) for the PPA group were more symmetrical between the two hemispheres than for the PSA group.   **:p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, after Bonferroni correction.  \n  \n\nGiven that the hemispheric   change score   values were based on the FC change values (i.e., z-scores) and, hence, indexed the symmetry of the FC changes relative to control values, we also examined   raw   FC symmetry using the original nodal FC values for each participant (including the controls). We found, that as with the FC  change scores  , the PPA group also showed higher raw LH-RH similarity than the PSA group across all four FC measures ( ). When compared to the controls, the PPA group generally exhibited higher than normal FC symmetry and the PSA exhibited lower than normal FC symmetry (numerically and/or statistically). The results are reported in  . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo better understand the consequences of stroke and progressive brain disease for the brain’s functional reorganization and neuroplastic responses, we examined the functional network organization of two groups of individuals, one with primary progressive aphasia (PPA, non-fluent variant) and another with post-stroke aphasia (PSA). More specifically, we set out to evaluate the hypothesis that the two diseases may differ with regard to two stroke phenotype features proposed in  : decreased inter-hemispheric and increased intra-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC). In order to be in a position to draw stronger inferences about the contribution of disease type to any observed FC changes, we selected groups that were well matched in terms of locus of neuroanatomical damage (left frontal and anterior parietal lobe,  ) and aphasia profiles ( ). Using resting-state fMRI, we examined four FC properties, two each at global and local network scales. Our key findings were as follows: (1) With regard to inter-hemispheric homotopic FC (hemispheric synchronization), the PSA group exhibited lower than normal levels, consistent with the Seigel et al. phenotype feature, whereas the PPA group exhibited higher than normal FC between homotopic areas. These changes were found to be associated with different behavioral patterns ( ). (2) With regard to intra-hemispheric FC, in the primarily damaged left hemisphere, both groups showed complex patterns of FC increases and decreases ( ) which, nonetheless, were highly correlated across the two groups for all the four FC measures ( ,  ). In contrast, in the relatively intact right hemisphere, the two groups showed distinct FC change patterns with the PPA group exhibiting FC changes that mirrored those in the left-hemisphere, whereas PSA exhibited a markedly different pattern of FC changes in the right hemisphere compared to the left ( ,  ); (3) Importantly, across all four FC measures, the PPA group showed significantly more symmetrical changes across the two hemispheres compared to the PSA group ( ). Together, the results reveal similar FC properties in the heavily damaged left hemisphere for both stroke and progressive aphasia. Otherwise, despite similar language profiles and damage distributions, the two groups exhibited distinctive patterns of inter-hemispheric FC symmetry and synchronization, \n\n### Functional connectivity between the hemispheres (hemispheric synchronization) \n  \nHomotopic FC measures the degree to which the fMRI time-courses of homologous brain regions of the two hemispheres are correlated and, thus, can be seen as reflecting the degree of synchronization (or integration) between homologous brain regions of the two hemispheres.   proposed that a decrease in homotopic FC was a key phenotypic feature of stroke. In the current study, our finding of significantly lower than normal homotopic FC for the PSA group ( ) provides further support for the claim. The current findings are also consistent with those we reported in  . While the previous study and the current one involved a largely overlapping set of PSA individuals, the neural measures were entirely different.   analyzed background connectivity extracted from task-based BOLD obtained while participants were carrying out a spelling task in the scanner while, in the present study, resting-state BOLD was analyzed. The finding of similar results with different neural measures and different stroke groups at both sub-acute and chronic stages strengthens the claim that decreased homotopic FC may well be a characteristic feature of stroke. \n\nImportantly, the analyses revealed opposite patterns in PSA and PPA, with the PPA group exhibiting a significant increase in homotopic FC relative to controls that was also significantly higher than that observed in the PSA group ( ). Thus, the two neurological diseases resulted in highly distinctive FC changes with regard to the synchronization of resting-state activity across homologues areas. This is consistent with our prediction that the two diseases would differ regarding fundamental FC features, despite the overall similarity of the groups in terms of language profiles and damage distribution. \n\nThe behavioral relevance of these homotopic FC changes was supported by their significant association with behavioral measures. For the PSA group, which showed lower than normal homotopic FC, lower FC values were associated with lower language scores ( d). For the PPA group, which exhibited higher than normal homotopic FC, higher FC values were associated with worse executive performance ( c). In sum, for both groups, more abnormal homotopic FC values (either elevated or reduced) were related to worse behavioral scores. Of further interest is the fact that the two groups showed complementary patterns: for the PSA group the homotopic FC changes were unrelated to executive function scores, while for the PPA group they were unrelated to language scores.  This complementary pattern of association between homotopic FC changes and behavior is likely related to the different neurotopographical distributions of the significant homotopic FC changes, namely, the PPA group exhibited a largely medial and anterior distribution of elevated homotopic FC, while the PSA group’s reduced homotopic levels were concentrated in lateral temporal and posterior areas ( b). In other words, behavioral performance was linked to FC changes in brain areas associated with the correlated cognitive functions such that executive function performance was associated with homotopic FC changes in the medial/anterior regions that are often associated with executive functions, while language performance was linked to homotopic FC changes involving (temporal and parietal) language-related areas.  Note that despite contrasting overall patterns of elevated and depressed homotopic FC in the two groups, a few connections were identified with reduced homotopic FC in the PPA group when scanning protocol was included as a co-variate (supplementary analyses, SFig. 10), and a small number of connections were identified with elevated homotopic FC in the PSA group ( b, also SFig. 6, 10). Thus, there may exist a small number of homotopic connections with values that are different from the overall patterns. It is likely that specific cohort characteristics (e.g., lesion size and location, disease progression) play a role in whether these values emerge as statistically significant in any given sample. It will be useful for future research to examine the homotopic FC patterns in each group in more detail as any variability may constitute a source of information regarding underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. \n\n\n### Similar patterns of left-hemisphere FC changes \n  \nThe second stroke phenotype feature proposed by   was increased FC between ipsi-lesional functional networks. In that regard it is worth noting that   already reported a complex pattern of ipsi-lesional left hemisphere FC changes in the stroke group they studied and pointed out that even   had not reported a consistent FC pattern in the ipsi-lesional hemisphere. In fact, the significant result Siegel et al. reported was limited to the FC between the dorsal attention network and the default mode network. Thus, this second proposed stroke phenotype feature had already not received strong support, somethingwe confirmed in the current study. \n\nWe found a complex picture that included both FC increases and decreases in the left hemisphere ( ). Both groups actually exhibited an overall decrease in left hemisphere FC, although there were also a small number of statistically significant FC increases as well. What was most salient, however, was the similarity of the left-hemisphere FC change patterns for the two groups ( ,  ). In fact, for the four nodal FC measures, at both local and global scales, there were strong and highly significant correlations between nodal FC values across the two groups (r values ranged from 0.4 − 0.7) in the heavily damaged left-hemisphere. This similarity of the left-hemisphere FC profiles across the groups seems to suggest (at least for these FC measures) that the different characteristics of the two diseases (e.g., the nature of the structural damage and the disease trajectories) may not have been highly relevant in the left hemisphere and that, instead, the   location   of damage (regardless of its etiology) was the primary driver of the neuroplastic FC changes we observed. Note that we also found that the overall magnitude of structural damage (global gray matter atrophy and lesion volume for PPA and PSA, respectively) was not a significant predictor of the left-hemisphere FC changes ( ). \n\n\n### Different patterns of right-hemisphere FC changes \n  \nThe original stroke phenotype study ( ) did not report significant FC effects in the contralesional hemisphere in their analysis of post-stroke FC changes. However, it is worth noting that their sample was extremely heterogenous and included individuals with either left or right hemisphere stroke at the subacute stage (<2 weeks). In contrast, the current investigation that involved only chronic (>6 months) left hemisphere stroke and a more behaviorally homogeneous population. Here we found that both PPA and PSA groups exhibited significant FC changes in the right hemisphere ( ). For the PSA group these consisted almost entirely of FC increases relative to controls, while for the PPA group the right hemisphere changes consisted primarily of FC decreases. Furthermore, even the FC increases were distributed quite differently for the two groups, as they were concentrated in ventral regions in PPA and primarily in dorsal areas in PSA. Thus, in contrast to the strong similarity of the FC changes for the two groups in the left hemisphere, the two groups exhibited quite different patterns of FC changes in the right hemisphere (see  ,  ). The contrast between the two hemispheres in terms of between-group similarity is captured quantitatively by the finding that for three of the four FC measures (all except CC) the correlations of FC changes between the two groups were significantly lower in the right hemisphere than in the left ( ). \n\nA key question concerns the cause of these right hemisphere differences between the two groups. One possibility to consider is that the FC changes in the RH are driven by different degrees of structural damage in the RH. However, we did not find that the FC changes in the RH were related to the extent of structural damage except for the finding that for the PSA group, reduced RH FC was moderately related to greater RH atrophy (r = -0.45, uncorrected p = 0.03, see Table S3), and the same trend was also evident in the PPA group (r = -0.3, uncorrected p = 0.11, see Table S3). Thus, the divergent RH FC patterns of the two groups are not readily explained by differences between the groups with regard to structural damage. This suggests an alternative account, raising the possibility that the divergence between the two groups in terms of FC patterns could have been driven by differences in the time-course of the two diseases that may have resulted in different patterns of functional reorganization. This is a hypothesis that would especially benefit from longitudinal empirical studies as well as computer simulation work. \n\n\n### Differences in the inter-hemispheric symmetry of FC changes \n  \nThe differences between the PSA and PPA groups with regard to the functional synchronization of the homotopic regions described above (i.e., homotopic FC,  ), imply that the two groups also differ in the degree to which changes in one hemisphere mirrored those in the other (i.e., hemispheric symmetry). The question of hemispheric symmetry of FC changes was examined in more detail in Analysis 3 which went beyond examining connectivity between homologous areas, to a more comprehensive examination of multiple measures of FC changes within each hemisphere in order to examine the degree to which changes in one hemisphere were reflected in the other. This detailed analysis of hemispheric FC symmetry revealed that across all four FC measures, the FC changes exhibited by the PPA group were significantly more similar across the hemispheres than they were for the PSA group ( ). In other words, the PPA group experienced more symmetrical FC changes than did the PPA group. Moreover, we found no statistically significant correlations between the degree of FC symmetry and the extent of structural damage (Analysis 3). The finding of robust differences in the hemispheric symmetry of FC changes between the two groups may well represent the most significant contribution of this work to our understanding of the characteristic (or phenotypic) FC responses of the brain to these different neurological diseases. \n\n\n### Differences in hemispheric symmetry and synchronization: Underlying mechanisms? \n  \nStroke and progressive neurological disease differ along various dimensions making it extremely difficult to determine which dimension/s is/are responsible for both the similarities and differences in the neuroplastic responses we have reported for the two groups. Despite this difficulty, the issue is of fundamental importance and, therefore, merits some discussion. Here we bring together the relevant evidence (albeit limited) from this investigation regarding the nature of the structural damage, the location of the structural damage and the temporal trajectories of the diseases. \n\n Nature of the structural damage.   Compared to progressive neurological disease, stroke clearly produces a more severe focal structural disruption to the brain, directly destroying contiguous regions of gray matter and often creating white matter disconnections. Particularly in the chronic stage it can additionally produce diffuse gray and white matter atrophy ( ,  ,  ). In contrast, in progressive neurological disease, although damage is typically concentrated in a disease “epicenter” ( ,  ), damage is more diffuse than in stroke even within highly affected regions as these areas are typically not fully destroyed but continue to contain neurons and their connections. While we are not in a position to draw strong conclusions about the contribution of these differences in the nature of the structural damage to the FC differences we have reported, we believe that it is worthwhile to review some of the potentially relevant evidence from this study. \n\nFirst, in various analyses we evaluated the contribution of the magnitude of damage to the FC patterns we have observed. For PPA, the magnitude of structural damage was quantified as gray matter atrophy, and for PSA it was quantified as the stroke infarct (and we also considered atrophy volume for PSA). The rationale for these analyses was that if the nature of the damage was a key factor in accounting for the observed FC changes, more damage would likely be associated with greater FC changes. However, contrary to this prediction, across these analyses we found little evidence of significant relationships between FC changes and the magnitude of structural damage (see Supplementary Material 4). \n\nSecond, we speculated that if the nature of the structural damage were critical in determining FC patterns, then the two groups would differ in their FC patterns more in the left hemisphere where the structural damage was concentrated. However, we found instead that the FC patterns for the two groups were more highly correlated in the heavily damaged left hemisphere and differed more in the right hemisphere ( ,  ). \n\nIn sum, while these observations by no means fully address the possibility that differences in the focal/diffuse nature of the structural damage is the mechanism underlying the group differences in FC changes that we have reported, it is nonetheless the case that they do not especially support this hypothesis. \n\n Temporal disease dynamics.   Although increased homotopic FC synchronization and inter-hemispheric FC symmetry have not been specifically previously evaluated in PPA, in healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease a loss of hemispheric specificity and greater “homogenization” of activation patterns have been proposed to be signature functional changes ( ,  ,  ). Relatedly, symmetrical functional changes have been reported in PPA ( ,  ,  ). \n\nWith regard to lifespan changes in lateralization of function, from childhood to adulthood brain areas supporting higher cognitive functions have been shown to become increasingly lateralized ( ,  ), presumably reflecting functional specialization and neural differentiation. However, starting in later middle age this trend may reverse with more distributed and bilateral activation patterns ( ,  ) and increasing levels of inter-hemispheric synchronicity ( ,  ). The reasons for this “re-emergence” of greater hemispheric symmetry in aging is debated. Some have proposed a general process of de-differentiation ( ), while others, including some working on preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease, have suggested that some of these neural changes may be compensatory and precede overt behavioral decrements (for reviews see  ,  ). The fact that de-differentiation across the hemispheres has been observed both in progressive brain disease and healthy aging suggests that they might be a response to a gradual time-course of damage. In the context of progressive neurological disease,   specifically speculated that these characteristics may be due to plasticity mediated by a gradual “supervised learning process” that allows for the reshaping of proximal and distal functional networks. With regard to behaviora consequence, they suggestthat, after a long pre-clinical period of changes that help maintain behavioral integrity, the gradual damage exceeds neuroplastic capacity and behavioral deficits emerge. Despite these intriguing similarities, the extent to which progressive neurological disease and aging share similar neoplastic changes and underlying disease kinetics is a topic that clearly merits further careful attention. \n\nIn terms of stroke, the increased FC asymmetry between the hemispheres that we found is consistent with other previous reports indicating that in post-stroke aphasia, the ipsi-lesional LH often shows hypo-connectivity while the RH often shows hyper-connectivity that may normalize or persist throughout the chronic period ( ,  ). These findings support the conclusion that after stroke, the contra-lesional hemisphere undergoes functional changes that are distinct from those that occur in the ipsi-lesional hemisphere. Interestingly, similar findings have also been reported in the context of tumor resection ( ,  ). While tumor resection may typically occur following a more prolonged period of neural disruption than stroke, both stroke and resection include major, abrupt neurological changes. Thus, similarities in FC outcomes between the stroke and tumor resection support the hypothesis that abrupt, unilateral focal damage may trigger functional dissociations between the two hemispheres. \n\n The location of structural damage.   The two previous sections focused on possible explanations for the observed   differences   in the FC changes across the two groups. However, also potentially relevant to understanding underlying mechanisms are the similarities in FC changes that we observed. The fact that these changes were so similar in the heavily damaged left hemisphere ( ) suggests that neither the nature of the structural damage nor the different temporal disease trajectories can provide a full explanation. Instead, the patterns of similar FC changes across the groups seem likely to be the result of the location of the structural damage rather than factors related to damage etiology. In other words, the similar spatial damage distributions of the two groups produced similar FC changes. Because specific brain regions participate in specific functional and structural networks, their damage may trigger functional reorganization patterns that are independent of the nature of the damage. Examining other PSA and PPA groups with different damage epicenters (e.g., semantic and logopenic variant PPA) will be important for determining the extent to which the specific FC features we have observed in this study are linked to specific damage location or to the disease etiologies more generally. \n\nIn sum, while the available evidence regarding underlying mechanisms of the FC differences we have documented in stroke and neurodegenerative disease is very limited, it does suggest that the distinct functional changes of the two groups observed in the right-hemisphere and in inter-hemispheric relationships were not driven by the nature of the structural damage (diffuse vs focal). Instead, we have argued that disease time-course remains a viable hypothesis. However, as the spatial and temporal features are overlapping for the current two groups (i.e., abrupt disease onset and focal damage vs slow development and diffuse damage), it is extremely difficult to disentangle the two factors. Importantly the results do suggest that the location of damage is a relevant factor for understanding the FC similarities observed in the heavily damaged left hemisphere. Understanding the possible contributions and interactions between these factors clearly will require further examination including, importantly, longitudinal studies of FC changes in diseases with different damage time-courses, damage types and damage locations. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nLimitations include that, within PPA, we examined only the non-fluent PPA variant. Examination of other PPA variants will be necessary to determine if the features we observed for PPA generalize across the disease or are restricted to the non-fluent variant. More generally, the study of additional diseases and conditions (e.g., anoxia, slow-growing tumors, vascular brain disease) will allow further disentangling of the contribution of damage type and disease trajectory. Finally, a more comprehensive and detailed examination of FC-behavior relationships would be very valuable, although it was clearly beyond the scope of this paper that was focused on documenting and describing robust FC changes. Despite the limited investigation of FC-behavior relationships, the fact that different patterns of homotopic FC changes in the two groups were associated with different cognitive functions (executive functions in PPA and language in PSA), does underscore the behavioral relevance of FC changes and provides some initial insights regarding the nature of the reorganization that results from the different neuropathologies. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn this study we identified shared and distinct features of the functional neuroplastic responses of two neuropathological conditions -- stroke and neurodegenerative disease. We specifically examined two groups of individuals with post-stroke and progressive aphasia with regard to the two stroke phenotype features proposed by   -- decreased inter-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) and increased intra-hemispheric FC. We found that the two diseases differed from one another clearly and substantially regarding inter-hemispheric, homotopic FC. However, with regard to the second stroke phenotype feature we found that neither group provided a exhibited a consistent pattern of increased intra-hemispheric FC. We did find, however, that the two groups were strikingly similar in terms of their patterns of left hemisphere FC but differed in their FC patterns in the right hemisphere. Overall, we found that generally similar distributions of left hemisphere damage in the two etiologies resulted in similar functional connectivity changes within the left hemisphere. However, abrupt onset, focal disease produced greater independence in hemispheric responses, while a slowly developing diffuse damage resulted in more symmetrical changes across the hemispheres as well as more synchronized activity between them. These findings constitute novel evidence regarding the specific patterns of functional reorganization associated with stroke and neurodegenerative disease. They not only underscore the importance of disease location in shaping neuroplastic responses, they raise the possibility that the temporal time-course of damage progression may also play a significant role in the brain’s response to damage. \n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Yuan Tao:   Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization.

However, previous studies only focused on specific activation areas of the brain, and there are few studies on the inactivation areas. This may overlook much information that explains the brain’s cognitive function. In this paper, we propose a relatively inert network (RIN) and try to explore its important role in understanding the cognitive mechanism of the brain and the study of mental diseases, using adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as an example. Here, we utilize methods based on group independent component analysis (GICA) and   t  -test to identify RIN and calculate its corresponding time series. Through experiments, alterations in the RIN and the corresponding activation network (AN) in adult ADHD patients are observed. And compared with those in the left brain, the activation changes in the right brain are greater. Further, when the RIN functional connectivity is introduced as a feature to classify adult ADHD patients from healthy controls (HCs), the classification accuracy rate is 12% higher than that of the original functional connectivity feature. This was also verified by testing on an independent public dataset. These findings confirm that the RIN of the brain contains much information that will probably be neglected. Moreover, this research provides an effective new means of exploring the information integration between brain regions and the diagnosis of mental illness. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe identification of resting-state networks (RSNs) in the brain from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) time series (TC) and the analysis of functional connectivity have revealed much about the macroscopic spatio-temporal organization of the brain. The brain’s acquisition of information and decision-making is a manifestation of a range of neural activities. These processes involve a wide range of functional brain networks. Activation responses of voxels are often associated with the multifunctional collaboration of the brain. So even in the same network, different regions may show different levels of activation, and different activation levels can reflect different responses of neurons to different tasks. However, in previous studies, more have been conducted on activated areas of the brain (activation values above a certain threshold). Few have researched relatively inert regions of the brain, ignoring important information about the presence of relatively inert areas. Therefore, this prompted us to study it and try to discover its important role in the discovery of biomarkers of mental illness through this study. \n\nIn this paper, we define relatively inactive regions in the RSN as relatively inert networks (RINs), and we explore the important role of RINs in brain cognition in terms of network and functional connectivity. The method of brain activation detection includes correlation analysis ( ), general linear model ( ), cluster analysis ( ;  ), principal component analysis (PCA) ( ;  ), and independent component (IC) analysis (ICA) ( ;  ;  ;  ). Among them, correlation analysis and general linear models require a prior given stimulus function, so they are more suitable for data analysis of task fMRI. For resting-state data, the detection of activation is equivalent to the identification of RSN. ICA is one of the most widely used methods for estimating brain functional networks. And it is suitable not only for task-state data but also for the study of resting-state data without the need for   a priori   knowledge. It models fMRI data as linear combinations of independent sources and can identify cross-individual patterns and common cohesive components. Since ICA generates ICs in any order, to make ICs comparable across subjects, we used the group ICA (GICA) method to identify RSNs in healthy subjects and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients in this study. We stitched fMRI data along the time dimension and implemented ICA on group data; then we used the group information-guided ICA (GIG-ICA) method ( ) to obtain group-level ICs; and subject-level ICs were obtained from the group-level ICs.   T  -test-based methods were then used to identify RINs and the corresponding activation networks (ANs). To better mine the information in RINs, this paper provides a method to estimate RINs and AN TC. \n\nADHD is a neuropsychiatric disorder that affects young children and adolescents. However, ADHD is not a child-specific disorder; it is a chronic process with symptoms that last until adulthood, including remission cases, by up to 50% ( ;  ). The common behavioral manifestations of ADHD are attention deficit, hyperactivity, and impulsivity ( ;  ;  ). ADHD patients usually present with a variety of concomitant disorders, and they are overlain by one or more concomitant psychological disorders, such as addiction, borderline disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders ( ;  ). Due to misunderstandings and lack of knowledge about this disease, many people with ADHD are misdiagnosed and often fail to receive effective treatment ( ). At the same time, the falsifiability based on the diagnostic scales is also very worrying ( ;  ). Therefore, the diagnosis of adult ADHD is more difficult compared with childhood ADHD. Studying structural and functional changes in adult ADHD and further investigating potential biomarkers related to their neural mechanisms are essential for their early detection and more effective treatment ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In recent years, rs-fMRI has been enhanced in the field of ADHD and has acquired many influential neurocognitive networks ( ;  ). Previous studies have identified changes in functional connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and networks that support attention and cognitive control in ADHD patients ( ), and abnormal network connectivity is related to the severity of symptoms ( ). However, it is unclear whether these also appear in RINs and whether abnormal changes occur in RINs. \n\nThis paper is the first to study the RIN of the brain and to use adult ADHD data as an example to explore its application in the research and diagnosis of mental diseases.   shows the entire research process. In the first step ( ), the GICA method is used to obtain RSN, and then it is selected. In the second step ( ), the RIN and AN were identified, and then the corresponding TC were estimated using our proposed method. Finally, ( ) the extracted features were analyzed and used for the training and testing of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We observed that RIN and AN were significantly different between adult ADHD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Also, we compared the differences in functional network connectivity (FNC) between the two groups of subjects. In addition, the identification of adult ADHD patients from HCs by a model based on FNCs with RINs and ANs was significantly better than that by a model characterized by original functional connectivity. This was also verified based on independent dataset testing. These suggest that the RIN also plays an important role in brain information transmission. \n  \nFlowchart of the research method.   (A)   Extraction of the RSN using GIG-ICA.   (B)   Identification of the RINs and the ANs, and calculation of the corresponding time-series.   (C)   The analysis process based on RINs and ANs. \n  \n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Independent Component Analysis \n  \nThe ICA method assumes that the observed random signal   X   obeys the model as follows ( ): \n\nSince the number of voxels in spatio-temporal fMRI data is much more than the number of time points, the spatial ICA method is usually more suitable for modeling given fMRI data.   X   = (  x  ,   x  ,…   x  ,   … x  )    represents a random variable in the spatial ICA,   K   is the number of time points,   x   is a vector of length   L  , and   X   represents a given 3D fMRI image with L voxels at time   K  .   S   = (  S  ,   S  ,…   S  )    is   N   unknown and mutually independent source signals (corresponding to the function network),   A   is an unknown mixing matrix, and the purpose of ICA is to estimate the mixing matrix   A   and the source signal   S   only through   X  . The ICA model has two assumptions about the source signal: one is that the observed signal is a linear combination of several statistical independent source signals and the other is that the distribution of the source signal is non-Gaussian (at most one can be Gaussian). \n\nSince both   A   and   S   are unknown, their exact values cannot be calculated in the actual solution. The separation matrix   W   and the estimate   Y   can be estimated by optimizing the independence of   S  . For example, the classic ICA method uses minimizing mutual information ( ), and Hyvarinen used maximizing non-Gaussian (measured by negentropy or kurtosis) to estimate these components ( ). Specifically, it finds a separation matrix W by constantly updates and iterations: \n\nWhen   W   is closer to   A  ,   Y   is closer to   S  . \n\n\n### Group Independent Component Analysis \n  \nAn effective method of multi-subject analysis is GICA ( ), which can identify ICs at the group level and reconstruct the independent specific subject components at the subject level. Compared with ICA for each subject separately, it is easier for GICA to establish a direct correspondence of different subject ICs. First, the group IC (GIC) is calculated by the GICA method, and then specific subject ICs are reconstructed by using the GIC. Common reconstruction methods include GICA ( ), constrained ICA (cICA) ( ), spatio-temporal regression ( ), and GIG-ICA ( ). In this paper, the GIG-ICA is used to extract brain functional networks in fMRI data, and specifically, the method transformed this process into the multi-objective optimization problem described in (3). \n\n Q  (  w  ) is the negative entropy of   Y  , which is the   i  th estimated IC,  ;   is the random vector after PCA whitening, and   R   represents the spatial reference that is the GIC of the zero mean and unit variance in the previous step after normalization.   E  [.]represents a mathematical expectation,   G  [.]is an arbitrary non-quadratic function, and   z   is a Gaussian variable with zero mean unit variance.   C  (  w  ), which is specifically defined as ϕ{  Y  ,   R  }=E[  Y   R  ], is used to measure the closeness between the estimated component   Y   and the reference   R  . By solving the multi-objective optimization problem, the optimal separation column vector   w   is generated to maximize the independence of   Y   and maximize the proximity of the reference   R   and the independence of   Y   at the same time. To solve the multi-objective optimization problem, it is usually necessary to find the Pareto optimal set or its subset and to strictly evaluate which specific compromise solution is more suitable for the researched problem. To prevent the optimization from being dominated by a larger cost function, the   arctan   function is used to normalize   Q  (  w  ), and the objective function is transformed into the following formula: \n\nHere,   a   is the weighting parameter, which can be determined empirically. Use the gradient descent method to continuously iterate for solving   w  , and calculate   Y  . The corresponding TC   T   is equivalent to the mean of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) series of all voxels weighted by its associated IC z-score. \n\n\n### Identification of Relatively Inert Network and Activation Network \n  \nDuring a resting-state scan, the internal network patterns of the brain may change substantially ( ). If we focus only on the activated areas of the brain, it is easy to overlook the potential information in relatively inert areas. We used the GIG-ICA method to separate the signals from the rs-fMRI data of HCs, and we processed the individual components with a one-sample   t  -test. We defined the area higher than the threshold μ in each IC (corresponding to a certain RSN) as AN and the other area as RIN. Thus, for each RSN, the corresponding AN and RIN can be further obtained. On this foundation, we propose the following method to estimate the TC corresponding to each AN and RIN, and the sum of their TC is the same as the TC of that original IC. \n\n T   represents the TC corresponding to the AN, and   T   represents the TC corresponding to the RIN.   Ve   and   Va   represent the number of voxels in the RIN and AN of the   i  th component, respectively.   V   is the total number of voxels,   f   is the   v  th column of   X  , and   y   is the   v  th value of the   i  th component.   d   is the   v  th value of   d  (  V  ×1), which indicates whether the   v  th voxel is activated, 1 indicates activated, and 0 indicates inactive. So the estimation is equivalent to the mean of BOLD series of the corresponding areas voxels weighted by the z-score of their associated IC. \n\n\n\n## Experiments and Results \n  \n### Materials and Data Preprocessing \n  \nThe neuroimaging dataset shared by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Neuropsychiatric Research Association ( ), which includes 138 healthy subjects, 58 subjects with schizophrenia, 49 subjects with bipolar disorder, and 45 subjects with ADHD, was downloaded. The dataset is shared through the OpenfMRI project and formatted according to the brain imaging data structure (BIDS) standard. The participants were asked to stay relaxed and to keep their eyes open, without giving them any stimuli or asking them to respond, and then were scanned to obtain resting-state data using the 3T Siemens Trio scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). A total of 152 time points were scanned. T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence was used to collect functional MRI data with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2 s, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle (FA) = 90°, field of view (FOV) = 192 mm × 192 mm (64 × 64 matrix), number of slices 34, and slice thickness = 4 mm. For more information about the dataset, please refer to the link:  . The resting-state data of healthy and ADHD subjects aged 21--50 years were used in this paper. The SPM12 software  was used to preprocess the data including removal of the first 10 time point images, slice timing correction, motion correction, spatial standardization using the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) EPI template, and use of 4-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel to smooth in space. Subjects with excessive motion were excluded, and 42 healthy and 41 ADHD subjects with matching gender and age were selected. \n\nTo assess the robustness of our results, our method was replicated on an independent publicly ADHD dataset, publicly available for download at  . This dataset has 25 ADHD patients and 84 healthy subjects. These subjects were recruited by the adult ADHD program group at the New York University School of Medicine, United States. The subjects laid flat in the MRI machine with their eyes open and in a relaxed awake state. The scan TR = 2 s, TE = 25 ms, scan resolution was 64 × 64, intra-slice resolution was 3 mm × 3 mm, slice thickness = 3 mm, and number of slices was 39, covering the entire brain area; and a total of 197 time points were scanned. Subjects who did not undergo psychiatric evaluation or were younger than 20 were excluded. The same preprocessing method used for the UCLA data was used, and subjects with excessive head movements were excluded. To avoid a confounding effect due to an imbalance in the sample, 23 healthy subjects and 24 patients with ADHD were finally selected. The two groups of subjects were matched in terms of gender and age. All subjects were between 20 and 50 years of age. The distribution of the HC-ADHD population for these two datasets is shown in  .   shows the age and gender indices of the two datasets. According to the results of statistical tests, there were no significant differences in age and gender between the two groups for each dataset. \n  \nThe distribution of the control–ADHD population.

Then the time cascade method is used to combine all the subjects’ reduced data. Another PCA (group level) was performed to further reduce the time dimension of the group data to the number of IC, and then the Infomax algorithm ( ) was applied to extract the GIC. GIFT software (version 3.0c)  was used to perform GICA in the two groups of subjects. Meanwhile, the minimum description length (MDL) standard ( ) was utilized to estimate the dimensions to determine the number of components. HCs were estimated with 30 components, and ADHD with 29. In order to obtain a reliable GIC, the ICASSO method ( ) was used to repeat the ICA 20 times. And the GIG-ICA method was used to reconstruct the corresponding TC and the unique IC of each subject. The IC that we needed was identified and picked out. In the first step, the correlation between the spatial map of each component and the prior mask map of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provided in the DPABI software package ( ) was calculated in the MNI standardized brain space. Since components with high correlation with prior CSF or white matter or low correlation with the gray matter may be affected by human factors ( ), they were excluded to ensure that the selected components are mainly concentrated in the gray matter area. In the second step, due to the low-frequency characteristics of the BOLD signal, the power spectrum of the network should show higher low-frequency spectrum power. Therefore, the ratio of the low-frequency power to the high-frequency power of each component was calculated, and the component with a higher ratio was screened out (most ratios of low-frequency to high-frequency power of some networks are greater than 10). The third step is to calculate the spatial correlation between the remaining components and the eight core intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) reported by   and to select the eight best-matched components with the visual inspection and correlation coefficients. These eight networks are (a) medial visual network (MVN), (b) lateral occipital visual cortex (LO), (c) auditory area network (auditory), (d) sensorimotor area (sensorimotor), (e) DMN, (f) executive control network (ECN), and (g) and (h) right-lateralized fronto-parietal network (RFPN) and left-lateralized fronto-parietal network (LFPN).   shows the sagittal, coronal, and cross-sectional planes of the eight best-matched ICNs.   (left) shows the activation peak coordinates of eight ICNs from a to h in the HC group, and   (right) shows the activation peak coordinates of 8 ICNs from a to h in the ADHD group. It is worth noting that after comparing the activation peak coordinates of the eight large-scale networks of the two groups of subjects, it is found that the network with the closest peak coordinates in the sensorimotor area is followed by LO, LFPN, and DMN, while the network with the largest difference in activation peak coordinates in the auditory area is followed by RFPN and ECN. \n  \nEight best-matched intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) and their peak activation coordinates.

In this way, each RSN could be divided into AN and RIN. The areas with different activation levels in the two groups of subjects were counted, and a two-sample   t  -test was further performed.   shows the areas where ANs and RINs differed significantly between the two groups of subjects when the threshold μ = 3 (  p   < 0.05). There are two scenarios for this difference. One is that the areas (indicated by cold areas) are the intersections of the RINs of HCs and the ANs of adult ADHD; i.e., HCs show no activation, whereas adult ADHD patients show significant activation. These areas show abnormally enhanced activation in adult ADHD patients; the second (indicated by hot area) is that the areas are the intersections of ANs of HCs and RINs of adult ADHD; i.e., HCs show activation, but ADHD patients show no activation. In other words, the activation in these areas is significantly weakened in adults with ADHD. Some responses in cognitive function are usually reflected in the brain activation. Statistical analyses were conducted in these abnormal areas. Compared with those in HCs, the areas of enhanced activation in adult ADHD patients were concentrated in the precentral gyrus (Brodmann areas 4 and 6), insula (Brodmann area 13), postcentral gyrus (Brodmann areas 3, 43, and 40), cuneus (Brodmann areas 7, 18, and 19), and superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 41). The areas of weakened activation were mainly concentrated in the insula (Brodmann area 13), superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 22), medial frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 8, 9, and 10), and inferior parietal lobule (Brodmann areas 7, 39, and 40). Furthermore, when analyzing RSN activation in both groups of subjects, it was found that the activation difference of adult ADHD patients is distributed in both the left and right hemispheres, compared with that of the HCs. However,   shows that there are more areas of discrepancy in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere. \n  \nGroup differences of functional network maps between ADHD patients and HCs. It is a summary of eight functional network differences. The intersection of the RIN of the HCs and the AN of the adult ADHD; and the areas that satisfy the two-sample   t  -test and have significant differences are shown as cold areas. The intersection of the AN of HCs and the RIN of adult ADHD; and the areas that satisfy the significant difference of the two-sample   t  -test are shown as hot area.

In this study, the method in section “Identification of Relatively Inert Network and Activation Network” was used to estimate the TC corresponding to the RINs and ANs for each participant. Applying Pearson’s correlation coefficient to calculate the FNC, a 16 × 16 FNC matrix was obtained for each subject.   shows the mean FNC for each group of subjects. The bottom left corner of the matrix shows that there is some connectivity between RINs and ANs. Also, comparing  , it was observed that AN and RIN of the same functional network are highly connected for both ADHD patients and HCs. And the connectivity between RINs is higher than the connectivity between ANs. In addition, the differences in functional connectivity between different networks were more pronounced in HCs than in ADHD patients. \n  \nThe average functional connectivity of each group of subjects.

FNC, functional network connectivity; HC, healthy control; ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; RIN, relatively inert network; AN, activation network. \n  \nAccurate identification of disease-specific induced changes in functional connectivity is considered an important task that can highlight the underlying mechanisms of the disease. Therefore, a two-sample   t  -test was performed for each element of the FNC matrix to compare the different functional connectivity between the two groups.   shows the FNCs with significant differences between HCs and adult ADHD [μ = 3,   p   < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected].   shows the number of altered connections for each network. It can be found that the auditory area and RFPN changed the most. Also, the enhancement and weakening of the FCN were further counted.   shows that the connectivity of ECN_i was significantly weakened in the ADHD group compared with the HC group. Meanwhile, compared with HCs, adult ADHD patients show a very strong connection in most changed FNCs, especially those involving the auditory area. \n  \nGroup differences in functional network connectively.

SVM models were utilized to classify HC and ADHD. Thirty percent of the UCLA dataset was used as the test set, and the remaining part as the training set. Feature selection using XGBoost ( ) and 10-fold cross-validation was used to train the models. The predicted values of each strategy were obtained for McNemar’s test. As a result, the AllFNC classification performance was significantly higher than the OriginalFNC at μ = 1, 2, and 3 (  p   < 0.05). Further, the data label was randomly shuffled, and the classification was repeated 100 times to test the significance along the massive permutation.   shows the box plots of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score for 100 classifications of the four features with different values of the threshold μ. \n  \nBox plots comparing the performance of classification using different features. Red represents the OriginalFNC, green represents the ActFNC, blue represents the InertFNC, and purple represents the AllFNC.   (A–D)   The horizontal axis is the threshold μ; vertical axis represents the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. * indicates   p   < 0.05, and   indicates   p   < 0.01. \n  \nWhen μ = 2, AllFNC offers the highest classification (the average accuracy = 94.2%, sensitivity = 92.1%, specificity = 96.3%, and F1-score = 93.7%). The next highest is InertFNC (accuracy = 87.1%, sensitivity = 86.8%, specificity = 87.4%, F1-score = 86.6%) and then OriginalFNC classification (the average accuracy = 82.0%, sensitivity = 82.3%, specificity = 82.1%, F1-score = 81.5%). A two-sample   t  -test was used, and the results showed that both AllFNC and InertFNC were significantly better classified than the OriginalFNC (  p   < 0.01). Similar results can be obtained when μ takes other values. \n\nAs with most psychiatric disorders, there are no specific physiological indicators to diagnose adult ADHD ( ). To locate mutations more accurately, a single FNC as a feature was used to classify adults with ADHD and HCs, and the experiment was repeated 20 times. Features with F1-scores higher than 0.65 were selected under four thresholds (μ).   shows the mean of the classification performance of the four best-performing features that were finally screened. When they were examined, it was found that all four features were significantly different, and all showed enhanced ADHD functional connectivity. The classification results of the four best-performing features are shown in  . Notably, all four features were associated with the Auditory_a network. The FNC between Auditory_a and Sensorimotor_i was used as a feature for classification with an accuracy of 0.87 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91. \n  \nThe comprehensive results of the classification performance for a single feature. \n      \nBest classification performance of a single feature. \n    \n\n#### Generalization to New York Dataset \n  \nSample size has a profound impact on the variability of accuracy and accuracy estimates ( ). To avoid exaggeration of statistical power and classification parameters, independent publicly available datasets were used to compare the performance of the original functional connectivity and the functional connectivity with the introduction of RINs and ANs on the classification of adult ADHD. Specifically, with the complete UCLA dataset was trained and tested in New York dataset, which features different acquisition parameters. It is worth noting that in practical application scenarios, the labels of the samples are not available before classification. Therefore, for all test sets, cICA was utilized to compute a specific set of eight RSNs, which avoids the restriction in GICA that requires grouping the data in advance. The computation of features in the UCLA data is then replicated. Similarly, the XGBoost method is employed to select the features. Meanwhile, the data were randomly shuffle, SVM was repeated 100 times for the classification results shown in  . The experimental results show that the average classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score of the OriginalFNC100 are 0.438, 0.472, 0.402, and 0.459, respectively, while the average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score of the AllFNC100 classifications with the introduction of RIN and AN are 0.647, 0.675, 0.620, and 0.663, respectively. A two-sample   t  -test was further performed on the results of the two methods, and it was found that their differences were significant (  p   < 0.01). Although it is difficult to avoid the degradation of classification accuracy in the independent dataset because more work related to feature engineering was not performed (using only functional connectivity), our method still has a greater advantage over the OriginalFNC. \n  \nBox plot of predicted performance using independent datasets. Two-sample   t  -test showing significant differences in all indicators. \n  \n\n#### Threshold Analysis \n  \nAfter extraction of the IC (corresponding to the functional network of the resting brain) using the ICA method, the results are usually Z-transformed. For the determination of brain activation areas, the area above the threshold is AN, while the area below the threshold is RIN. The threshold μ can be determined empirically. To assess the effect of the threshold μ on the study results, the experiments compared four different FNCs under different threshold conditions. As the threshold value increases, the range of AN becomes smaller. Therefore, the threshold value is usually not set too large. In this study, ECN_i is empty when μ is not less than 4. Therefore, the differences in FNCs between the two groups of subjects were compared under four conditions with threshold μ equal to 1, 2, 3, and 4.   shows the FNC with significant differences between the adult ADHD and HC groups at different threshold value μ. The results show that when μ is taken at different values, there is only a small change in functional connectivity with significant differences between the two groups of subjects. This also suggests that the changes in FNC differences between the adult ADHD and HC groups are within acceptable limits when the thresholds are within a certain range. \n  \nFNC with significant difference between ADHD and HC groups under different threshold μ.   (A–D)   Different thresholds and the two-sample   t  -test   p   < 0.05 (FDR corrected). Red represents that the functional connectivity of ADHD is stronger than that of HC, and blue represents that the functional connectivity of ADHD is weaker than that of HC. FNC, functional network connectivity; ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; HC, healthy control; FDR, false discovery rate. \n  \nTo further exclude the effect of different thresholds on the classification performance of HCs and ADHD patients, the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score were calculated when the threshold μ was taken with four different values of 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the experiments in section “Classification Within University of California, Los Angeles, Dataset.” As shown in  , the classification performance using AllFNC is always the best when μ takes different values. Also, the performance of classification using only the functional connectivity features between RINs in most situations is higher than the performance of the original network functional connectivity.   shows the average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score values for 100 classifications at different threshold values (μ). It can be demonstrated above that there is no significant effect on the classification results when the threshold value is 1–4. \n  \nClassification performance of different features under different thresholds. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this paper, we propose a method for the identification and estimation of RINs and apply it to the study and diagnosis of the disease using fMRI data of adult ADHD as an example. Compared with the traditional methods, our method focuses not only on the activated areas of the brain but also on the relatively inert areas of the brain. The activated areas of the brain are usually delineated by setting a threshold value. However, brain areas encode information in multivariate responses, and neural computations are nonlinear ( ). Strictly speaking, the portion below the threshold (the relatively inert area) is not completely inactive, and weaker or nonlinear reactions may be present. It is likely that these responses are not decomposed by ICA (or other methods of matrix decomposition), since these methods usually assume that the obtained BOLD signal is a linear accumulation of the source signal. As a result, we believe that the relatively inert areas also contain important information that can be used for disease diagnosis. \n\nSpecifically, by comparing ANs and RINs, we identified abnormal activation areas in the brains of adults with ADHD compared with healthy subjects. Mainly, the activation was significantly enhanced in the precentral gyrus (Brodmann areas 4 and 6), postcentral gyrus (Brodmann areas 3, 40, and 43), and superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 41), while the activation was significantly weakened in the superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 22), medial frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 8, 9, and 10), insula (Brodmann area 13), and cuneus and inferior parietal lobule (Brodmann areas 7, 39, and 40). This suggests that the increased activation in Brodmann areas 4, 6, and 40 in children with ADHD ( ) did not disappear in adult patients either. Abnormalities in Brodmann area 4, which controls behavioral movements, and Brodmann area 8, which together with Brodmann area 6 constitutes the premotor cortex, are likely to be associated with overactive symptoms in ADHD patients. In addition to this, we found changes in both right- and left-brain activation in adult ADHD patients and more extensive changes in right brain activation. This is similar to the changes in the right hemisphere in childhood ADHD patients ( ). \n\nThe results in   show that there is a correlation between RINs and ANs as well as different areas of different networks. The exchange of information between these areas can be further explained by the fact that brain processing of complex cognitive tasks is not only related to ANs, but RINs are also involved. We also found some weakened connectivity of the auditory area with other networks in adult ADHD patients. For example, the functional connection between Auditory_a and Sensorimotor_i, RFPN_i, and Auditory_i is weakened. This coincides with studies related to ADHD patients showing deficits in the auditory area ( ;  ). And these findings could not be obtained using the original functional connectivity analysis. \n\nAcross studies, there appear to be significant network disruptions involved in ADHD ( ). Therefore, the detection of abnormal connectivity is crucial to further localize areas associated with psychiatric disorders. We further compared the ability to detect abnormal FNCs in ADHD patients using original networks and the introduction of RINs and ANs in  . In  , the FNC changes in ADHD patients are mainly concentrated in the RFPN, while the weakened functional connectivity is reflected in the DMN and ECN.   uses pie charts to count the distribution of functional connectivity changes. The two plots on the left depict all changes (including enhancement and weakening). It can be noticed that both results are similar, but more changes in the auditory area can be detected with the introduction of RIN. It is worth noting that the four best-performing features finally filtered in   are all related to the auditory network, as evidenced by the results in  . Therefore, we have reasons to believe that the auditory changes are real. Moreover, it can also be found in the two plots on the right in subplot (B). Also, for the weakened connections, the original network analysis could not find the weakened LFPN connections. This suggests that the introduction of RINs and ANs may reveal not only the differences analyzed at the original RSN level but also the discovery of additional areas associated with changes in cognitive function in disease. This point is likely to have been overlooked in past studies. \n  \nComparison of the ability of the original network and RINs to detect abnormalities in ADHD patients.   (A)   The group differences of the original FNC. A two-sample   t  -test was used to detect differences between HCs and ADHD patients. Only functional connections with significant differences are shown in the graph (  p   < 0.05, FDR corrected). Red color indicates enhanced functional connectivity in ADHD patients, and blue color indicates weakened functional connectivity.   (B)   The distribution of the networks involved in the FNC group differences detected by the two approaches. The bottom three plots show the FNC change statistics for the original network, and the top three plots show the functional connectivity change statistics after the introduction of RINs. In the top plots, the statistics for each network include the corresponding RIN and AN. For two the left plots, the overall change includes the increase and decrease of functional connectivity; the middle two plots are the networks with weakened functional connectivity; and the two right plots are the networks with enhanced functional connectivity. RIN, relatively inert network; ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; FNC, functional network connectivity; HC, healthy control; FDR, false discovery rate. \n  \nIn addition, features constructed based on RINs and ANs (functional connectivity is used in this paper) produce a relatively accurate diagnoses of adult ADHD, with better classification results than those constructed using the original RSN. This effect may be related to the use of the large amount of information present in the RIN. Although it is difficult to avoid the decrease of accuracy in the independent dataset because we did not do more work related to feature engineering (using only functional connectivity), our method still has a greater advantage over the features constructed by the original RSNs. In addition, features based on RINs and ANs, such as dynamic functional connectivity ( ), dynamic brain fluctuations ( ), or combined with non-image information features ( ), are expected to lead to better diagnostic results. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe exploration of brain RINs has provided new research ideas to study the integration of information between brain areas and disease diagnosis. In this study, we achieved the identification of brain RINs and ANs. Further experiments showed that brain RINs also contain much information about cognitive functions. At the same time, we proposed a new method to achieve diagnosis and study of adult ADHD patients using FNC of RINs and ANs. The experimental results showed that our method well improved the accuracy of disease diagnosis (0.98). This is an initial study of the efficacy of RINs. The ICA-based method we used is also a preliminary attempt. In addition, the eight functional networks we used were not customized for adult ADHD but for the most classical cognitive functional networks in the brain. Therefore, our study is also applicable to the study of other psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. Due to time constraints, only functional connectivity was used in this study. In the future, we will implement more features such as effective connectivity and dynamic functional connectivity and will continue to explore more functional brain integration and disease diagnostic outcomes in brain RINs. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards at UCLA and the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health.

Neuroimaging studies have related ADHD with the interplay of fronto-parietal attention systems with the default mode network (DMN;  ). However, some results have been inconsistent, potentially due to methodological differences in the analytical strategies when defining the brain functional network, i.e., the functional connectivity threshold and/or the brain parcellation scheme. Here, we make use of topological data analysis (TDA) to explore the brain connectome as a function of the filtration value (i.e., the connectivity threshold), instead of using a static connectivity threshold. Specifically, we characterized the transition from all nodes being isolated to being connected into a single component as a function of the filtration value. We explored the utility of such a method to identify differences between 81 children with ADHD (45 male, age: 7.26–17.61 years old) and 96 typically developing children (TDC; 59 male, age: 7.17–17.96 years old), using a public dataset of resting state (rs)fMRI in human subjects. Results were highly congruent when using four different brain segmentations (atlases), and exhibited significant differences for the brain topology of children with ADHD, both at the whole-brain network and the functional subnetwork levels, particularly involving the frontal lobe and the DMN. Therefore, this is a solid approach that complements connectomics-related methods and may contribute to identify the neurophysio-pathology of ADHD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Significance Statement \n  \nTopological data analysis (TDA) investigates the topology of interacting nodes. It may model the connectomes as a topological process instead of a static graph, exploring the transition of all nodes being isolated to binding together, as a function of the connectivity threshold. Here, we explored three parameters to characterize the algebraic topology of individual connectomes using four different brain atlases, further exploring the subnetwork levels. Our findings showed that the area under the curve (AUC) robustly differentiates children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children (TDC), suggesting decreased functional segregation, with the greatest effects on the frontal lobe and the default-mode network. Overall, these results support the use of the proposed methods to robustly explore topological differences in the brain connectome. \n\n\n## Introduction \n  \nCurrent neuroimaging technology allows the exploration of the human brain as a network of structurally and/or functionally connected constituents, i.e., voxels or regions of interest. In particular, functional connectivity is defined as the synchrony of neuronal activity patterns of anatomically separated brain regions ( ;  ) and many studies have explored this property to provide new insights about the functional organization of the brain in health and disease ( ;  ;  ), providing the means to study the neurofunctional alterations of neurologic and psychiatric disorders from a systems perspective. \n\nOne of the most commonly used frameworks to explore the functional brain network is graph theory, which provides a theoretical basis to describe and characterize complex networks ( ;  ). In this framework, the brain network is modeled as a graph composed of a set of nodes (mainly voxels or larger regions) and their connections (in this case, the functional connectivity between pairs of elements). In practice, this is constructed using a matrix where each entry is a measure of connectivity between two nodes and then a threshold is applied to construct an adjacency matrix which represents the non-spurious connections. However, there is no general criterion to assign an appropriate set of regions of interest (ROIs), nor a defined threshold, which may result in divergent results among studies. For instance, several studies exploring the functional connectome of children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), have reported different results. Specifically, some studies have found higher network segregation and lower integration in ADHD patients compared with controls ( ;  ), while others found no differences when exploring the same properties ( ;  ). Such divergent results may be partially explained by the variability in methods, including threshold and ROIs selection ( ;  ), as well as the variable robustness of some of the most used approaches ( ). \n\nRecently, topological data analysis (TDA), has been adopted in neuroimaging as a tool to quantify and visualize the evolution of the brain network at different thresholds ( ,  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ). The main objective of this method is to model the network as a topological space instead of a graph ( ;  ), allowing the assessment of the functional connectivity matrix as a topological process instead of a static threshold-dependent representation of the network. One of the possible applications is to characterize how the isolated nodes gradually bind together into larger components (sets of connected nodes) as a function of the filtration value (connectivity threshold), until a single component is recruited. For this purpose, the number of components at a given filtration value is termed the Betti-0 (see Materials and Methods). This process is summarized in a so called Betti-0 curve ( ), which has been shown to differentiate children with developmental disorders from controls using data from positron emission tomography (PET) and defining the brain network at the group-level ( ,  ). However, it has been typically applied to brain networks defined at the group level, i.e., exploring the covariance of concatenated physiological or structural data from groups of subjects, instead of exploring the individual characteristics of the network and comparing them between groups. Furthermore, the consistency of the method across different brain segmentation schemes has not been explored. \n  \n The Betti-0 curve.    A   , Two-dimensional toy example: a set of 15 nodes, four filtration values ε, represented as the circle diameter and their corresponding Betti-0 (B ).    B   , Betti-0 curve for a hypothetical brain network; each point in the curve represents the B  for each filtration value. In both cases, at ε = 0 the number of components is equal to the number of nodes,   n  . As the filtration value increases, the number of components reduces, and eventually will reach a single one containing all nodes. Brain views generated with brain-net ( ),   r   stands for Pearson’s correlation. \n  \nIn this work, TDA was applied to explore individual brain networks based on the resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) of children diagnosed with ADHD and typically developing children (TDC), obtained from the publicly available ADHD-200 database ( ). First, the consistency of this methodology was explored when using four different brain segmentation schemes (atlases), and then group differences were identified between ADHD and TDC groups, at the whole-brain and subnetwork levels. ADHD is a developmental disorder characterized by a lack of control of appropriate behavior and a difficulty to maintain attention ( ;  ). Current theories propose the potential alteration of multiple functional networks and their interaction, including the default, cognitive control (fronto-parietal), dorsal and ventral attention, and salience networks ( ;  ). Consequently, it was expected that the proposed methodology would reveal significant differences between groups among the components of these functional networks. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Sample \n  \nImaging and phenotypic data from 263 participants corresponding to the New York University Child Study Center dataset were obtained from the ADHD-200 database ( ). Subjects reported with a secondary diagnosis and/or not medication-naive status were discarded. Only those with good imaging quality and complete phenotypic information were used for subsequent analysis, resulting in a total of 182 children. Study protocols were approved by the New York University Institutional Review Boards, and after an explanation of study procedures a written informed consent from parents and assent from children were required. \n\nPediatric diagnosis was based on the Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for Children Present and Lifetime Version (KSADS-PL) and the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale-Revised, Long version (CPRS-LV). Moreover, IQ was measured with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). Inclusion in the ADHD group was based on the parent and child responses to KSADS-PL and obtaining a t-score greater or equal than 65 in any of the ADHD related indices of the CPRS-LV. TDC had ADHD summarized t-scores below 60, and lack of any DSM-IV axis-I disorders. Exclusion criteria were an IQ below 80 or any chronic medical conditions. However, phenotypic data of three ADHD datasets showed full intelligence scores below 80, while two TDC showed   t   scores >60 in the ADHD summary scale. Data from those subjects were discarded for further analysis, resulting in a final sample of 81 ADHD children (average age ± SD: 10.5 ± 2.48 years old) and 96 TDC (12.26 ± 3.07 years old;  ). \n  \nPhenotypic information by diagnostic group \n    \n\n### Imaging acquisition \n  \nMagnetic resonance images were acquired with a Siemens Magnetom Allegra 3T scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions). Whole-brain fMRI volume images were obtained using a T2 -weighted echo planar imaging interleaved sequence (TR/TE = 2000/15 ms, flip angle = 90, voxel size 3 × 3 × 4 mm , FOV = 240 × 192 mm ) with a scan duration of 6 min. Participants were instructed to remain still, close their eyes, think of nothing systematically and not fall asleep. In order to obtain an anatomic reference, high-resolution structural T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) images were acquired (TR/TE = 2530/3.25 ms, flip angle = 7°, voxel size 1.3 × 1.0 × 1.3 mm , FOV = 256 × 256 mm ). \n\n\n### Preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing was implemented using FMRIB’s Software Libraries (FSL v.5.0.6;  ). Steps included removing the first four volumes, slice timing, head motion correction, brain extraction, regression of confounding variables, bandpass temporal filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz), and spatial normalization. Given that psychiatric and pediatric populations usually show higher in scanner motion than controls and adults ( ), a rigorous confounding regression strategy was implemented to minimize head motion artifacts. Specifically, several variables were regressed out from the functional data, including the six rigid-body motion parameters, the average signal from both white matter (WM) and CSF, the derivative of these eight parameters and the square of these sixteen variables ( ). In addition, to minimize the impact of physiological noise, five principal components of the signal from WM and CSF were also included as confounding variables ( ;  ). Furthermore, those volumes with a root mean square (RMS) of relative head motion >0.25 mm were also included as confounds ( ). Subjects with an average RMS of relative head motion higher than 0.55 mm or <4 min of non-motion-affected data, were discarded. Eventually, each fMRI volume was registered to its corresponding T1 image with a rigid-body transformation, followed by an affine and nonlinear registration to a 2 × 2 × 2 mm  children-specific template, the 4.5–18.5 years old NIHPD atlas ( ). \n\n\n### Functional connectomes \n  \nFor every dataset, four functional connectomes (connectivity matrices) were computed based on different brain atlases: AAL ( ), P264 ( ), CC200, and CC400 ( ). All of them include cerebrum and cerebellum. The first one consists of a segmentation of 116 anatomic regions, the second one is a set of 264 spherical ROIs with high reliability in both task and resting fMRI large datasets, while the last two are segmented based on functional connectivity homogeneity (with 190 and 351 nodes, respectively). \n\nFor each subject and atlas, the average fMRI signal of every defined region was extracted and then the functional connectome was computed as the Pearson’s cross-correlation between all possible pairs of regions. The reliability of the explored TDA variables along the atlases was assessed by the Kendall’s concordance coefficient (KCC). \n\n\n### TDA \n  \nTypically, the brain connectome is modeled as a graph (G), which is a collection of nodes (V) and edges (E). Nodes usually represent regions of interest, while edges represent structural or functional connections between those nodes. Nevertheless, this graph can be represented as a topological space as well, in particular, the Rips complex, denoted by Rips(F,ε), where F represent the nodes (same as V) and ε, the filtration value, which is a positive number that states if two nodes in F are connected (if their distance is lower than ε). Algebraic properties extracted from this topological space are called Betti numbers, particularly, the Betti-0 number (B ) accounts for the number of components, i.e., the number of isolated nodes or sets of nodes connected by a sequence of edges; Betti-1 number refers to the number of cavities in the two-dimensional space between nodes, and so on (for extensive review on TDA, see  ;  ). In this work, we focus exclusively on B . If we start with a filtration value ε = 0, all nodes are disconnected, and the number of components equals the number of nodes. When ε gradually increases, some isolated nodes will connect with others and the number of components decreases. Therefore, B  will diminish as the nodes gradually connect to each other as ε increases. It is possible to identify the filtration values for which there is a change in B , until there is only one large component containing all the nodes. This process is summarized in the so-called B  curve ( ). \n\nHere, the distance between nodes is defined as in  , i.e., d(ξ, x ) = 1 −   r  (ξ, x ), where   r   is the Pearson’s correlation between the pair of nodes ξ and x . The B  curves are computed with the TDA package in R ( ), and characterized in terms of the area under the curve (AUC), slope, and kurtosis. The AUC accounts for the overall transition from all nodes being isolated to being connected into a single component, with smaller areas suggesting that B  decreases with smaller filtration values. The slope accounts for the rate of change, being all negative, lower values mean a faster transition to a single component. Finally, the kurtosis accounts for how “tailed” the distribution is with respect to the average value, with higher values meaning faster transition to a single component. \n\n\n### Null model \n  \nIn order to prove that the estimated parameters of the B  curves are features of the brain topology, observed values were compared with those generated from a random distribution. A weighted null distribution was calculated based on the rewiring of the original connectivity matrices ( ). Specifically, 1000 permutations were run for each subject and parcellation. \n\n\n### Diagnostic group inferences \n  \nLogistic regression was applied to identify significant associations between diagnostic group and the B  features, including sex, age, and head motion as covariates ( ). This approach allows the calculation of the effect sizes of the orthogonal odds ratio (OR) for each term of the equation. All dimensional variables were standardized to   z   scores to be included in the model. This strategy was applied for each of the four brain atlases.\n \n\n expresses logistic regression model according to Wilkinson-Rogers notation ( ); “motion” accounts for average RMS relative head motion (mm). \n\nIn addition, the same logistic regression model ( ) was implemented at intranetwork and internetwork levels, i.e., considering the seven lobes of the AAL atlas, and the thirteen functional networks defined in P264. For example, logistic regression was applied for the subset of 28 frontal lobe nodes (based on AAL atlas), referred to as the Frontal intranetwork. Then, it was applied for the frontal-parietal internetwork subset (28 + 14 nodes), and so on. Given the 28 and 91 possible combinations, for the AAL and P264, respectively, significance was set to   p   < 0.05, corrected for a non-parametric family-wise error (FWE) approach based on clusters of edges (Network Based Statistics;  ), in which a   p   < 0.05 (bi-sided) was set for individual edges, and a null distribution of clusters was computed with 10,000 permutations. \n\n\n### Code accessibility \n  \nThe code/software described in the paper is freely available online at  . Also, the code is available as  . Present results were computed with an Intel Core i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60 GHz × 8 with Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS 64-bit. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Agreement across brain atlases \n  \nThe three explored properties of the B  curves showed a generalized sample agreement along the four brain parcellations. Significant agreement was found considering every atlas and each feature: area (KCC = 0.87; χ  = 609;   p   = 4.67e-49), slope (KCC = 0.68; χ  = 477;   p   = 1.33e-29), and kurtosis (KCC = 0.44; χ  = 307;   p   = 3.65e-09). Moreover, pairwise concordance coefficient was significant for every pair of atlases and every TDA metric ( ). \n  \nKCC between brain parcellations for the explored properties of the B  curves: AUC, slope and kurtosis. KCC value is depicted in yellow-red, with   p  (KCC > 0.59) < 0.05, given two raters and 176 degrees of freedom. \n  \n\n### Observed versus null model \n  \nWhen comparing observed results against those generated from the null model, B  curves from the randomized data reached the single component faster than the original data ( ). Regarding the explored parameters, the AUC and slope of the null model never reach the observed values, while permuted kurtosis are close to the original values in almost half of the iterations (  p   = 0.4098). \n  \nB  curves for each group and brain parcellation. Group average with 95% confidence interval (CI) of the B  curves. Forest plot of OR with 95% CI for the logistic regression terms of AUC, kurtosis (  K  ), and slope (  S  ) are depicted for each brain atlas: AAL (top left), CC200 (top right), P264 (bottom left), and CC400 (bottom right). Gray dashed line stands for OR equal to one. \n  \n\n### Whole-brain topology \n  \nThe area under the B  curves showed significantly lower odds for the ADHD group, no matter the brain atlas (AAL: OR = 0.622,   p   = 0.014; CC200: OR = 0.612,   p   = 0.008; P264: OR = 0.611,   p   = 0.013; CC400: OR = 0.572,   p   = 0.003), which means that the ADHD group has smaller AUC compared with the TDC group ( ). The area under the B  curves accounts for the overall transition from all nodes being isolated to being connected into a single component, with smaller areas when B  decreases faster as the filtration value increases. In other words, less AUC implies lower number of components, i.e., less segregation, which should be mediated by increased connectivity in the edges mediating the integration of components. In order to explore such edges, the proportion of subjects showing connectivity for each edge at some filtration values was compared between groups ( ). These tests showed widespread frontal short-range and cortical long-range edges being more frequently present in the ADHD group (  p   < 0.01, uncorrected;  ). No group differences were found for the slope nor the kurtosis, thus only the AUC was sensitive to differentiate both groups. \n  \nEdges with differences in the proportion of subjects between groups at ε = 0.35 (   A   ) and ε = 0.5, 0.75, and 1 (   B   ). Nodes from each lobe (AAL atlas) are represented with different colors in the chord diagrams. Only edges with a proportion difference at   p   < 0.01 (uncorrected) are depicted. For ε = 0.35 the edges are represented in the brain using brain-net ( ). R stands for the right side of the brain. \n  \n\n### Intranetwork and internetwork inference \n  \nLogistic regressions were performed in subsets of nodes as well, corresponding to the nodes of a single lobe or functional network (intranetwork) or the nodes of two networks (internetwork), according to the lobular and the functional parcellation of the AAL and P264 atlases, respectively. Resulting patterns of the AUC were significant after FWE correction,   p   = 0.0026 and   p   = 0.0147, respectively. Anatomical subsets included the intranetwork and every possible internetwork subset including the frontal lobe plus the temporal-subcortical interaction, and in every case the ADHD group showed a lower area compared with the TDC ( ). These results demonstrate a widespread decreased segregation of the brain network in the ADHD group, particularly involving the frontal lobe. When considering the functional systems in the P264 atlas, notably, all the subsets of nodes that included the default mode network (DMN) also showed smaller areas for the ADHD group, but other intranetwork and internetwork subsets showed similar patterns ( ). \n  \nGroup differences for anatomic and functional subnetworks.

Resulting B  curves were characterized in terms of three parameters: AUC, slope, and kurtosis; and compared between ADHD and TDC. The application of this model to a pediatric sample showed that the AUC was significantly lower for the ADHD group, both at the whole-brain and at the subnetwork level. These results showed decreased functional segregation in the ADHD group, mainly involving the frontal lobe and the DMN. \n\nThe B  curves were characterized in terms of three parameters, the AUC, slope, and kurtosis. Pairwise agreement between brain parcellations was high for the AUC (KCC range: 0.84–0.97) and the slope (KCC range: 0.69–0.9), and medium to low for the kurtosis (KCC range: 0.59–0.66). These results suggest that this methodology is consistent among different parcellation schemes, especially for the area under the B  curve. In addition, considering that the B  features do not depend on a particular connectivity threshold, but instead explore all the filtration values with a change in the topology of the network, this methodology contributes to provide a complete picture of the brain network, overcoming one of the main limitations of other approaches. Taken together, these are potentially important advantages that may complement other methods applied to brain networks, such as graph theory, which has been shown to be highly dependent on the brain parcellation scheme ( ;  ;  ), and on the selection of a connectivity threshold or connectivity cost ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nThe area under the B  curve was significantly lower for the ADHD group, both at the whole-brain network and at the subnetwork level, being strikingly significant for the interactions involving the frontal lobe and the DMN. As mentioned above, the AUC accounts for the overall transition from all nodes being isolated to being connected into a single component, with smaller areas suggesting that B , the number of components, decreases faster as the filtration value increases. Such differences in B  for a given filtration value are mediated by edges that bind together previously split components, which results from increased connectivity in some edges mediating the integration into larger components. Taken together, the results here presented can be interpreted as higher functional connectivity within the connectome and specific subnetworks in the ADHD group, especially those involving the frontal lobe and the DMN. Previous evidence has also suggested increased functional connectivity in a variety of regions of the frontal lobe in ADHD ( ;  ;  ), as well as fronto-occipital ( ) and fronto-subcortical connections ( ;  ), particularly those associated with reward and motivation ( ). Our results showed a similarly widespread pattern in several functional subnetworks, mainly the DMN, but also attention, salience, fronto-parietal, and auditory nodes, among others ( ). These results provide the basis to infer the potential functional systems being affected in ADHD, being consistent with the current theories involving such networks ( ), particularly with the DMN interference hypothesis, which is based on the findings of altered interactions between the DMN and networks involved in top-down executive control ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nPrevious studies have reported a myriad of differences in network properties between ADHD and TDC participants. At the whole-brain level, higher functional segregation and lower functional integration in ADHD subjects compared with controls have been reported ( ;  ), although other groups did not reproduce those results ( ;  ). Since the decreased area under the B  curves could be interpreted as higher integration and lower segregation of isolated components, our results seem to be contradictory to the aforementioned ones. Nevertheless, the previous studies explored connectivity costs higher than 10%, which according to   would correspond to filtration values higher than ε = 0.5, when most of the subjects actually exhibit a single component ( ). Therefore, these results are actually complementary, given that B  curves consider a wider range of connectivity thresholds, rarely explored with graph theory. Indeed, when exploring the edge-wise proportions between groups at different connectivity thresholds ( ), the ADHD group showed consistently widespread increases compared with the TDC. However, at lower connectivity thresholds (higher filtration values), the ADHD group showed decreased proportion of edges in several interactions, mainly including the frontal, temporal, subcortical, and cerebellar regions, which seem consistent with previous reports of decreased connectivity in ADHD ( ;  ;  ). These results evidence that the static representation of the network changes as a function of the connectivity threshold, therefore an approach that takes into account wider threshold ranges should provide better insights into the neurophysiological substrate of ADHD. \n\nAs far as we are concerned, only two previous studies have explored B  in ADHD brain networks ( ,  ), using fludeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) and interregion covariation at the sample level, qualitatively reporting higher number of components for the ADHD group compared with the TDC. Such findings seem to be opposite to the results here presented; however, methodological differences prevent direct comparisons between results. First, time-scales are significantly different, with the FDG-PET scans reflecting the glucose uptake occurring during several minutes; in contrast, rsfMRI reflects variations in blood oxygenation during tens of seconds. Furthermore, FDG-PET connectivity matrices reflect interregion covariation of (long-term) glucose metabolism across subjects, while rsfMRI connectivity matrices reflect interregion covariation (within seconds) within the same subject and later compared between groups. Overall, both methodologies potentially reflect complementary aspects of the functional connectomes in ADHD. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, the present study showed a robust and informative implementation of TDA in functional connectomics. The results exhibited significant differences for the brain topology of children with ADHD, both at the whole-brain network and at the functional subnetwork level, particularly involving the frontal lobe and the DMN. Therefore, this approach may contribute to identifying the physio-pathology of neurodevelopmental disorders, complementing other connectomics methods by exploring a larger connectivity range and reducing the bias of selecting a fixed threshold. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"f9c3c4c8e738ea0081106bbc6aa99124"},

It is not clear which factors are related to the treatment effect. Resting-state fMRI may be a good tool to predict the clinical efficacy of this treatment, and it is helpful to identify the most suitable population for this treatment. Methods: Forty treatment-refractory depression adolescents were treated by ECT and evaluated using HAMD and BSSI scores before and after treatment, and were then divided into a treatment response group and a non-treatment group according to the reduction rate of the HAMD scale. We extracted the ALFF, fALFF, ReHo, and functional connectivity of patients as predicted features after a two-sample   t  -test and LASSO to establish and evaluate a prediction model of ECT in adolescents with treatment-refractory depression. Results: Twenty-seven patients achieved a clinical response; symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation were significantly improved after treatment with ECT, which was reflected in a significant decrease in the scores of HAMD and BSSI (  p   < 0.001). The efficacy was predicted by ALFF, fALFF, ReHo, and whole-brain-based functional connectivity. We found that models built on a subset of features of ALFF in the left insula, fALFF in the left superior parietal gyrus, right superior parietal gyrus, and right angular, and functional connectivity between the left superior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral–right paracentral lobule, right middle frontal gyrus, orbital part–left cuneus, right olfactory cortex–left hippocampus, left insula–left thalamus, and left anterior cingulate gyrus–right hippocampus to have the best predictive performance (AUC > 0.8). Conclusions: The local brain function in the insula, superior parietal gyrus, and angular gyrus as well as characteristic changes in the functional connectivity of cortical–limbic circuits may serve as potential markers for efficacy judgment of ECT and help to provide optimized individual treatment strategies for adolescents with depression and suicidal ideation in the early stages of treatment. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered to be one of the best methods for MDD for all ages [ , ], especially for those with severe treatment-refractory depression. However, the usage of ECT in adolescents is limited and has always been carefully evaluated. In 2004, the AACAP developed practice parameters to assist clinicians considering ECT in treating adolescent patients. In these guidelines, criteria were outlined for selecting patients who might benefit from ECT treatment. Patients must have (1) a diagnosis of severe major depressive disorder, mania, schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, catatonia, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, (2) symptom severity that is persistently disabling or life threatening, and (3) failure of at least two adequate prior treatment regimens when feasible [ ]. In addition, because of its side effects and high cost, it is important to investigate which category of patient responds better to ECT; this has significant implications in adolescents with depression. Previous studies have explored how to predict the antidepressant effects of ECT; a structural MRI study focusing on ECT found that it caused an increase in hippocampal gray matter volume (GMV) and can predict the effect of ECT [ ]. \n\nThe efficacy of ECT has been found to correlate with an increased fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) in regions such as the prefrontal cortex, insula, and hippocampus, as well as increased GMV in regions such as the anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, thalamus, caudate nucleus, and hippocampus [ ]. These studies based on longitudinal data have explored longitudinal alterations in the brain induced by ECT, providing new insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of ECT. However, few studies have distinguished the differences in the patterns of response and non-response to ECT in adolescents with treatment-refractory depression based on resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Therefore, it is important to investigate the brain function differences between responders and non-responders to ECT to help provide meaningful biomarkers to identify responders. Previous studies have found that functional brain imaging metrics can be used to predict treatment outcomes in patients with depression. In a meta-analysis, functional connectivity (FC) in the DMN of depressed patients was found to predict the efficacy of ECT [ ]. Another study focused on FC as a predictor to explore its predictive effect in depressed patients after ECT and found that FC within the DMN as well as FC between the DMN and CEN could be used as predictors of response to ECT in depressed patients [ ]. \n\nWith the development of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning techniques have also started to be frequently used in the diagnosis and risk prediction of depression. Cui et al. [ ] developed an fMRI-based method for diagnosing schizophrenia by machine learning techniques with an accuracy of 87%. Methods such as the support vector model (SVM) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) can build models based on existing data and then achieve prediction for new datasets. Previous studies have found that SVM as well as LASSO can achieve more than 90% accuracy in diagnosing MDD based on fMRI features [ ]. Therefore, we consider that fMRI-based neurological features may be potential indicators related to the response to ECT in adolescents with treatment-refractory depression. \n\nThe aim of the study is to investigate the pattern differences at baseline in adolescents with treatment-refractory depression with different responses to ECT. Predictive models for the responding and non-responding groups were constructed using analyses based on ALFF, fALFF, ReHo, and FC. We used a logistic regression model (LRM) as well as SVM for prediction, and brain imaging at baseline of adolescents showing a response to ECT may help to expand our understanding of brain function predictors of the response to ECT. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nForty adolescents with treatment-refractory depression between 12 and 17 years of age were enrolled. The diagnosis was confirmed by two psychiatrists using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID). The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD 17)   ≥   17; (2) with a diagnosis of treatment refractory depression and no history of ECT treatment; and (3) patients with severe suicidal ideation (Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, BSSI   ≥   11) in the past week. Participants were excluded if they: (1) had a neurological or serious physical condition, any history of alcohol or drug abuse, any other somatic diseases, or morphological anomalies of the brain; (2) had any surgically placed electronic or metal materials that might interfere with fMRI assessment; or (3) had head motion exceeding 2.5 mm in translation or 2.5° in rotation. The clinical scale was assessed using HAMD and BSSI, response rate = (pre-treatment HAMD − post-treatment HAMD)/pre-treatment HAMD; if the response rate was ≥50%, they were considered to be responders, whilst if the response rate was <50%, they were considered to be non-responders. The study protocol was approved by the Human Research and Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (no. 2017-157). Written informed consent was obtained from all adolescents and their parents. We registered the study in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, the ID is ChiCTR2200064527. \n\n\n### 2.2. Electroconvulsive Therapy \n  \nModified bitemporal ECT was delivered by Thymatron DGx (Somatics, LLC, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. The first three sessions of ECT took place on continuous days; the remaining were performed every 2 days, with a break on weekends; after eight sessions, the ECT was completed. The first energy for ECT was 5% for all patients. The stimulation energy was adjusted based on the seizure time. The energy was increased by 5% in the subsequent treatment if the seizure time was <25 s. Anesthesia was induced with succinylcholine (0.5–1 mg/kg) and propofol (1.5–2 mg/kg). \n\n\n### 2.3. Image Data Acquisition \n  \nMR images were obtained using a 3T GE Signa HDxt scanner (General Electric Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) with an eight-channel head coil. Participants were instructed to relax with their eyes closed, stay awake, and avoid thinking as much as possible. None of the patients reported falling asleep during the scan. Foam pads and earplugs were used to fix their heads to minimize head motion and reduce machine noise, respectively. The echo-planar imaging pulse sequence parameters were as follows: repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms; echo time (TE) = 40 ms; field of view (FOV) = 240 × 240 mm ; matrix = 64 × 64; flip angle = 90°; slice number = 33; slice thickness/gap = 4.0/0 mm; scanner time = 8 min; and 240 volumes. Three-dimensional T1-weighted MR images were used for rs-fMRI co-registration (TR = 24 ms; TE = 9 ms; FOV = 240 × 240 mm ; matrix = 256 × 256; flip angle = 90°; and slice thickness/gap = 1.0/0 mm). \n\n\n### 2.4. Rs-fMRI Preprocessing and Feature Extraction \n  \nThe data were preprocessed using DPARSF software. The specific preprocessing process is as follows. (1) Data format conversion: convert DICOM format to NIFTI format. (2) Remove first time point: remove the initial 10 time points. (3) Slice timing: correct each layer of scanned data to one time point. (4) Realignment: covariate processing of white matter signals, cerebrospinal fluid signals, and head movement parameters (translation ≤ 2.5 mm, rotation ≤ 2.5°) using the Fristion-24 model. (5) Spatial normalization: because of the differences in subject head size, we need to perform spatial normalization, as follows. DARTEL alignment is used to align the brain fMRI images to the standard brain template, the standardized images need to be resampled, and the spatial resolution of the resampled functional images is 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm. (6) Spatial smoothing: the purpose is to reduce the impact of spatial noise on the data and reduce the differences in brain structure between subjects. (7) Detrending: during data acquisition, the noise of the machine will gradually increase, and this process may make our data change accordingly, so we need to complete the detrending to remove this effect. (8) Low-pass filter (0.01–0.10 Hz): the purpose of this is to reduce the impact of physiological noise such as the subject’s breathing and heartbeat on the acquired data. The next step is to calculate the whole-brain ALFF, fALFF, and ReHo for all patients; feature extraction based on the AAL template extracts the average ALFF, fALFF, and ReHo for the 90 brain regions of the patient group and FC for each brain region based on the whole brain as features. \n\n\n### 2.5. Model Building and Validation \n  \nBased on the dataset of 40 patients, 75% of the data was randomly selected as the training set, and the remaining 25% was used as the validation set. Based on the training set, feature selection was performed as follows: (1) a two-sample   t  -test was performed for each feature, and features with   p   < 0.05 were screened; (2) the optimal subset of features was selected using LASSO. In this method, the parameter λ controls the balance between data fit and sparsity, which is a parameter determined by using 10-fold cross-validation. Based on the selected features, LRM and SVM are constructed. SVM are a class of generalized linear classifiers that perform the binary classification of data in a supervised learning manner, where the decision boundary is a hyperplane of maximum margins for the learned samples, which can be reduced to a problem of solving convex quadratic programming. For the model built from the training set, the performance of the model is evaluated using a test set. The evaluation metrics include the accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPEC), positive prediction rate (PPV), negative prediction rate (NPV), area under the ROC curve (AUC), and discriminant performance (AUC: 0.9–1.0 = excellent; 0.8–0.9 = good; 0.7–0.8 = moderate; 0.6–0.7 = poor; 0.5–0.6 = failure). The following R packages (The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand) were used for pattern classification analysis: ( , version: 3.6.1). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Clinical Characteristics \n  \nA total of 40 adolescents with treatment-refractory depression enrolled in the study completed ECT. Of these, 27 (67.5%) patients achieved a clinical response (HAMD rate ≥ 50%). The other 13 (22.5%) did not achieve a clinical response (HAMD reduction rate < 50%), and there were no significant differences in age, gender, education, disease duration, HAMD, or BSSI scores between the two groups at baseline. After ECT, both groups showed a reduction in depressive and suicidal ideation scores ( ). \n\n\n### 3.2. Feature Selection \n  \nA,B show the results of LASSO feature selection, and   lists the feature information selected by LASSO. Nine features were finally selected: (1) ALFF of the left insula (INS.L); (2) fALFF of the left superior parietal gyrus (SPG.L); (3) fALFF of the right superior parietal gyrus (SPG.R); (4) fALFF of the right angular gyrus (ANG.R); (5) FC of left superior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral–right paracentral lobule (SFGdor.L–PCL.R); (6) FC of orbitofrontal middle gyrus–left cuneus (ORBmid.R–CUN.L); (7) FC of right olfactory cortex–left hippocampus (OLF.R–HIP.L); (8) FC of left insula–left thalamus (INS.L–THA.L); and (9) FC of the left anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri–right hippocampus (ACG.L–HIP.R). \n\n\n### 3.3. Validation Performance of LRM and SVM \n  \nThe performance of the LRM and SVM built based on the optimal subset of features selected for the training set in the validation set is shown in  , with close performance, both showing good efficacy in prediction performance (AUC > 0.8), sensitivity and specificity, and ROC curves as shown in  . \n\nThe predictive performance of the brain function of nine brain regions for efficacy was further evaluated based on the full data, which showed that the AUC of the patient group at baseline was 0.829 for ALFF of the INS.L, 0.835 for fALFF of the SPG.L, 0.781 for fALFF of the SPG.R, 0.721 for fALFF of the ANG.R, 0.687 for FC of SFGdor.L–PCL.R, 0.909 for FC of ORBmid.R–CUN.L, 0.829 for FC of OLF.R–HIP.L, 0.798 for FC of INS.L–THA.L, and 0.852 for FC of ACG.L–HIP.R; the ROC curves are shown in  . \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThis study investigated the possible predictive ability of brain functional imaging to predict whether adolescents with treatment-refractory depression respond to ECT. Our results showed that the accuracy of LRM is 81.8% and accuracy of SVM is 81.8%. We found that the ALFF of INS.L, the fALFF of SPG.L, SPG.R, ANG.R, and the FC of SFGdor.L–PCL.R, ORBmid.R–CUN.L, OLF.R–HIP.L, INS.L–THA.L, and ACG.L–HIP.R may predict the response to ECT in adolescents with depression. The present results suggest that local brain function and FC may serve as potential predictors of response to ECT in depressed adolescent patients. \n\nBoth the dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus and the orbitofrontal middle gyrus are important regions of the prefrontal cortex, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is thought to have a relatively important role in working memory and emotion regulation [ , ], while the orbitofrontal cortex is thought to be involved in activities such as emotional cognition as well as decision processing [ , ]. Previous studies have focused on the relationship between changes in the prefrontal cortex and depression, such as studies based on morphological changes that showed a decrease in prefrontal volume in depressed patients. Bora et al. found that patients not treated with antidepressants had significantly smaller prefrontal volumes than those treated with antidepressants [ ]. They also found a reduction in the volume of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depressed patients [ ]. \n\nThe relationship between the prefrontal cortex and depression has also been explored in more studies in rs-fMRI-based studies, such as Zhang et al. [ ], who found that the FC of the right prefrontal cortex to the amygdala was significantly increased in depressed patients compared with normal controls. Our study found that the FC of the SFGdor.L–PCL.R and ORBmid.R–CUN.L could be used to predict the effect of ECT in depressed adolescents. A review also focused on the prediction of rs-fMRI for ECT found that the FC of the prefrontal cortex correlated with the response of ECT, wherein the FC of the middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and orbit could predict the effect of ECT in depressed patients [ ]. In another study, Chen et al. [ ] found that the FC in the prefrontal areas could predict the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on depression, and the regions with the most predictive value were the dorsolateral prefrontal, ventral lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and medial prefrontal. This is similar to our findings and also suggests that the function of brain regions is more closely related to mood regulation, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal, which are more predictive of treatment response, no matter what the intervention is. \n\nWe found that an abnormal FC in subcortical areas may predict the response to ECT in adolescents with treatment-refractory depression, such as INS and ACG, and also found that both the local brain function and FC in INS.L were predictive of the response to ECT. INS is an important component of the limbic system, which is thought to represent cognitive, emotional, and visual capacities. Studies have also demonstrated that there is a reduction in the FC of INS with other brain regions in depressive patients, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, which can indicate the severity of depressive symptoms [ ]. Bouckaert et al. found that the gray matter volume and cortical thickness of INS increased after ECT in depressed patients [ ]. Wang et al. found that the FC of INS with the angular gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex increased in depressed patients after ECT, while the functional activity of the INS.R may be a marker of ECT response in depressed patients [ ]. There is a correlation between INS and ECT response in depressed patients [ ], suggesting that it may be a useful predictive biomarker; fMRI studies also showed that the resting-state network connectivity of the INS can predict ECT efficacy [ ]. In addition, we analyzed that the FC of ACG.L–HIP.R predicted the therapeutic effect of ECT. The cingulate gyrus belongs to the limbic system, and the ACG is a significant region of the cingulate gyrus that is closely related to emotion, cognition, and reward [ ]. Studies are common on the relationship between ACG and depression, such as Lai [ ], who found a reduction in cingulate gyrus volume in depressed patients compared with healthy controls. In terms of brain metabolism studies, Auer et al. [ ] presented data on abnormalities in glucose metabolism in the ACG in depressed patients, and in FC studies, abnormalities in this region were also noticed in depressed patients [ ]. HIP is generally considered to be related to memory [ ], and there are more inconsistent results in previous studies on HIP and depression, such as some studies that showed reduced HIP volume in depressed patients [ ]; however, Vakili et al. [ ] found no significant difference in HIP volume in depressed patients compared with healthy controls, but for depressed patients who were treated with ECT, the finding of increased HIP volume is generally consistent [ ], and it has been suggested that HIP volume at baseline may predict the effect of ECT [ ]. We considered that the FC of the ACG.L–HIP.R could predict the efficacy of ECT in depressed adolescents, and a recent fMRI study focusing on assessing ECT for depression showed that ECT may change the FC based on ACG or HIP as ROIs, and that HIP-based FC could predict the treatment effect of ECT [ ]. This is similar to our findings. \n\nThe parietal cortex, which plays a crucial role in the process of focusing attention, mainly includes the postcentral gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, and inferior parietal gyrus. The parietal lobe of the brain is composed primarily of the sensory and cortical components that monitor the response of various body parts to external stimuli. In addition, the parietal lobe is also involved in working memory and attentional capacity [ ]. In our study, we concluded that fALFF in the bilateral superior parietal gyrus predicted the therapeutic effect of ECT. Previous studies focusing on psychiatric disorders with suicidal behavior have shown a marked reduction in gray matter volume in the left superior parietal gyrus in patients compared with healthy controls [ ]. Several studies have indicated that metabolic deficits in the parietal lobe are altered in patients with depression with suicidal ideation; Heeringen et al. [ ] found that depressed patients with suicidal ideation had reduced metabolic activity in the right inferior parietal gyrus, and that reduced brain activity correlated with suicidal ideation. \n\nMethodologically, this study used both LRM and SVM, which were applied to demonstrate the validity of the results. Validation algorithms were used to verify the reproducibility and reliability. Machine learning studies will have an impact on precision medicine. The development of radiomics has created an ideal environment for the application of brain imaging in psychiatry, where psychiatric disorders do not yet appear as “lesions” in conventional brain imaging, but where markers and features predictive of mental disorders can still be obtained. We gathered functional brain activity features from functional brain imaging, and stepwise analysis can facilitate our findings to change clinical practice, which can contribute to the dissemination of potential markers. \n\nThere are still some limitations; first, we used medications in our study, so we could not exclude the impact of medications. Second, the prediction of this study mainly includes the brain function feature, such as ALFF, fALFF and functional connectivity. This result may not be reliable enough in other samples, so more indicators can be included in future research, such as biochemistry, gene, EEG, cognition and others, which may enhance the predictive effect of treatment response to depression. Third, because our sample size is small and has not been validated in an independent sample, our results should be treated with caution that may not apply to other independent samples. Due to the small amount of data, this study only preliminarily proves the prediction performance of functional characteristics. The sample should be further increased, especially by incorporating a multi-center sample, to establish a more reliable and better performance model. Finally, we did not observe the long-term effects of ECT for adolescents, so further research is needed. \n\nIn summary, altered brain function in adolescents with treatment-refractory depression may be an important cause of symptom onset, which also suggests that brain function may play a predictive role for the effect of ECT in depressive adolescents.

Each patient of rTMS groups received either 10.0 Hz rTMS over the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) or 1.0 Hz rTMS over the contralesional M1 for 10 consecutive days. A resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan and neurological examinations were performed at baseline and after rTMS. The motor network and functional connectivities intramotor network with the core brain regions including the bilateral M1, premotor area (PMA), and supplementary motor area (SMA) were calculated. Comparisons of functional connectivities and Pearson correlation analysis between functional connectivity changes and behavioral improvement were calculated.  \n\n\n## Results \n  \n Significant motor improvement was found after rTMS in all groups which was larger in two rTMS groups than in the sham group. The functional connectivities of the motor network were significantly increased in bilateral M1, SMA, and contralesional PMA after real rTMS. These changes were only detected in the regions of the ipsilesional hemisphere in the HF-rTMS group and in the regions of the contralesional hemisphere in the LF-rTMS group. Significantly changed functional connectivities of the intramotor network were found between the ipsilesional M1 and SMA and contralesional PMA, between contralesional M1 and contralesional SMA, between contralesional SMA and ipsilesional SMA and contralesional PMA in the HF-rTMS group in which the changed connectivity between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional PMA was obviously correlated with the motor improvement. In addition, the functional connectivity of the intramotor network between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional PMA was significantly higher in the HF-rTMS group than in the LF-rTMS group.  \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \n Both HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS have a positive effect on motor recovery in patients with subcortical stroke and could promote the reorganization of the motor network. HF-rTMS may contribute more to the functional connectivity reorganization of the ipsilesional motor network and realize greater benefit to the motor recovery. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nInterhemispheric imbalance and reduced interactions of neural activity and functional connectivity have been reported in both animal and human studies after stroke with motor dysfunction [ – ]. In addition, as the level of impairment increased, the network balance was more disrupted [ ]. Therefore, the balance of the motor network between the two brain hemispheres is crucial for functional motor recovery of stroke patients [ ]. Noninvasive brain stimulation, e.g., repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), has been recognized as an effective strategy to facilitate motor recovery by enhancing/suppressing neural excitability of ipsilesional/contralesional hemispheres to restore interhemispheric balance [ – ]. Finally, these lead to cerebral plasticity and reorganization of the motor network of the damaged hemisphere. \n\nNumerous functional neuroimaging studies have confirmed that recovery of motor function after stroke is commonly attributed to cortical reorganization of both ipsilesional sensorimotor areas and contralesional motor areas [ – ]. This reorganization is adaptive and is gradually shifted during the process of regaining motor function in the affected limbs. Additionally, reorganization of the ipsilesional hemisphere is traditionally believed to be most important for successful recovery [ ]. Findings from a study of low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) over the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) suggested that one single session of rTMS could transiently remodel the architecture of the disturbed motor network, reflected as reduced transcallosal influences and a restitution of ipsilesional functional connectivity, in particular, the effective connectivity between M1 and supplementary motor area (SMA) [ ]. Another stroke study with long-term high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) treatment observed increased interhemispheric functional connectivity between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional motor areas [ ]. Dual-mode stimulation combined with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) also detected noticeably increased interhemispheric connectivity in subacute stroke patients [ ]. However, in these studies, the difference between HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS on the influence of functional reorganization of the motor network was still not clear. The relationship between motor network reorganization and motor improvement has not been clarified. Maybe the restoration of some part of the motor network showed greater contribution to the recovery of motor function than others. \n\nTherefore, to further clarify the reorganization of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric functional connectivity of the motor network and the relationship with motor recovery of rTMS, this study was aimed at investigating the connectivity changes between brain regions of the motor network after HF-rTMS or LF-rTMS. The comparison of the motor network changes after HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS was also conducted to ascertain their different modulation mechanisms on the motor network. We hypothesized that significantly increased functional connectivities and their correlation with motor improvement would be observed in some motor areas after HF-rTMS or LF-rTMS. The influence on the motor network may be distinct between them. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nThirty-three right-handed stroke patients (mean age: 64.48, range 53-78 years) with motor deficits after a first-onset subcortical ischemic stroke in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery were enrolled from the Department of Neurology at the Second Clinical Medical College of North Sichuan Medical College (Nanchong, China) according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) right handedness, (2) ischemic lesion at the unilateral subcortical area confirmed by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), (3) showing unilateral motor dysfunction, (4) no history of neurological/psychiatric diseases, and (5) no contraindications of rTMS and MRI measurement. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) hemorrhagic stroke, (2) any other brain disorder or abnormalities, (3) history of drug dependency or psychiatric disorders, (4) severe white matter hyperintensity, (5) substantial head movement during the fMRI data acquisition according to the preprocessing result, and (6) contraindication to MRI and/or TMS. \n\nAccording to the Helsinki Declaration, this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Clinical Medical College of North Sichuan Medical College. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( ) and reported following the guidelines of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) group. All participants gave informed consent before the experiment. \n\n\n### 2.2. Study Design \n  \nAll stroke patients were enrolled at the acute stage with a subcortical lesion location encompassing the left internal capsule, basal ganglia, or corona radiate. These patients were assigned to the HF-rTMS group (11 subjects, five males and six females, mean age 65.09 ± 5.84, range 58-75 years), LF-rTMS group (12 subjects, five males and seven females, mean age 63.58 ± 7.95, range 53-78 years), and sham group (10 subjects, five males and five females, mean age 64.90 ± 6.23, range 58-75 years). Each patient received rTMS daily for 10 consecutive days. An MRI scan and several comprehensive neurological examinations including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), and Barthel Index (BI) were performed prior to the experiment and immediately after 10 days of rTMS. Based on these scales, the stroke severity, motor impairment, and daily living ability were evaluated. \n\n\n### 2.3. Intervention \n  \nAfter stroke, the equilibrium of cortical excitability between the two hemispheres is disrupted. This has shown decreased excitability of the ipsilesional hemisphere and increased excitability of the contralesional hemisphere [ ]. Based on the interhemispheric competition model, previous studies have reported that the inhibitory rTMS on the contralesional hemisphere could increase excitability of the ipsilesional motor cortex by reducing excessive interhemispheric inhibition from the contralesional motor cortex [ ,  ], whereas excitatory rTMS over the affected hemisphere directly increases the excitability of the ipsilesional motor cortex [ ,  ]. Therefore, the strategy of HF-rTMS over the ipsilesional motor cortex and LF-rTMS over the contralesional motor cortex was selected in our study. \n\nrTMS was performed by using a Magpro R30 stimulator (MagVenture, Lucernemarken, Denmark) equipped with a 70.0 mm butterfly-shape coil and a handle posterior and oriented sagittally. The scalp site that could elicit response in the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the affected/unaffected hand was selected as the optimal location of the center of the rTMS coil for HF-rTMS/LF-rTMS intervention. If nonresponsive activity could be detected stimulating the ipsilesional M1 for the patients in the HF-rTMS group, symmetric location homologous to the contralesional M1 would be defined as the stimulation site. A resting motor threshold (RMT) was established and was defined as the lowest rTMS intensity that could elicit a motor-evoked potential of at least an amplitude of 50 𝜇V in at least half of 10 consecutive stimuli over the M1 [ ]. Stimulation was applied at 90% RMT at 1.0 Hz frequency (900 pulses) over contralesional M1 in the LF-rTMS group (30 trains, 30 pulses/train, intertrain interval = one second, and a total of 900 pulses) and at 90% RMT at 10.0 Hz frequency (30 trains, 50 pulses/train, intertrain interval = 25 seconds, and a total of 1,500 pulses) over ipsilesional M1 in the HF-rTMS group. The sham group received rTMS with the same parameters as the LF-rTMS group over the contralesional M1 but without real stimulation to ensure that no current flow was induced in the brain. All rTMS sessions were performed in the same room. All stroke patients received the same physiotherapy and medical therapies which consisted of standard antiplatelet, statin, anticoagulation, and antihypertensive drugs during the period spent in hospital. \n\n\n### 2.4. MRI Acquisition \n  \nThe resting-state fMRI data were acquired on a GE Signa HDxt 1.5 Tesla scanner (General Electric Medical System, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an eight-channel head coil. To reduce head movements and scanner noises, the head of each patient was snugly fixed by a foam pad prior to the examination. After instructing the patients to keep awake, relaxed with eyes closed, and to remain motionless as much as possible, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired by using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence: TR/TE = 2, 000/40 ms, field of view = 240.0 × 240.0 mm , flip angle = 90°, matrix = 64 × 64, voxel sizes = 3.75 × 3.75 × 5.0 mm , 32 axial slices, and no gaps. Each scan obtained 140 volumes continuously. A 3D high-resolution structural image acquisition was also conducted: 124 slices, TR/TE = 9.1/2.9 ms, field of view = 240.0 × 240.0 mm , flip angle = 20°, matrix = 256 × 256, and voxel sizes = 0.94 × 0.94 × 1.2 mm . \n\n\n### 2.5. Preprocessing of the fMRI Data \n  \nImage preprocessing was performed by using the SPM 12 ( ) software package. Prior to the preprocessing procedure, the first five volumes of the fMRI datasets of each patient were discarded to eliminate the magnetization equilibrium effects and allow the participants to adapt to the circumstances. Subsequently, spatial processing including time delay correction between slices, head motion realignment, spatial normalization to the standard brain space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) (resampled to a voxel size of 3.0 × 3.0 × 3.0 mm), and spatial smoothing with 8.0 mm isotropic kernel was conducted. \n\n\n### 2.6. Independent Component Analysis \n  \nOnly the fMRI data of both rTMS groups was used to analyze the difference between HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS on the modulation of the motor network. With the preprocessed fMRI data, the GIFT software ( ) was used to conduct the group spatial independent component analysis (ICA) with the following stages: (1) two-stage data reduction of principal component analysis (PCA), (2) application of the ICA algorithm, and (3) back reconstruction using a dual-regression method to back reconstruct the individual independent components (ICs). To determine the number of ICs, dimension estimation on all patients of both rTMS groups was performed by using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion. Subsequently, the infomax algorithm was used in IC estimation. Then, following the reconstruction step, the individual specific IC maps were converted to a   Z   score. At last, the IC of the motor network was selected to be of interest for further analyses.   Z   maps of each group were then gathered for a random effects analysis using the one-sample   t  -test in SPM 12. Subsequently, to investigate the functional connectivity changes of the motor network after rTMS, the paired   t  -test analysis was used to compare the   Z   maps of the motor network of both groups between pre- and post-rTMS. Moreover, the same comparison of the   Z   maps between pre- and post-rTMS was conducted for each group, respectively, and also to understand the distinction of functional connectivity changes between the HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS groups. \n\n\n### 2.7. Functional Connectivity Analysis of the Intramotor Network \n  \nMotor recovery of stroke has been demonstrated to be associated with the reorganization of the functional motor network [ ]. Consistent dynamically increased regional centralities of the ipsilesional M1 within the motor network was also observed with the process of motor recovery [ ]. Therefore, in this study, the core regions of the cortical motor network of bilateral hemispheres including M1, SMA, and premotor area (PMA) were mainly focused on in order to investigate the modulation of rTMS on the functional connectivities among these regions of the intramotor network. The peak coordinates of these core regions were identified and selected from the comparison results of the motor network obtained from ICA analysis between pre- and post-rTMS of both groups. Finally, a spherical region of interest (ROI) (radius = 5.0 mm) was defined and centered at each peak coordinate within the corresponding brain region. \n\nSubsequently, the signal extraction, preprocessing, and functional connectivity analysis of the motor network were all completed in the Resting-State Hemodynamic Response Function Retrieval and Deconvolution (rsHRF) plugin ( ) in SPM [ ]. By using this software package, the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal was deconvolved to minimize the variability of HRF [ ]. The time series of all the voxels in each ROI was extracted from the preprocessed fMRI dataset and averaged as the representative time signal of the ROI. To minimize the effect of global drift, the time signal of each ROI was scaled by dividing each time point's value by the mean value of the whole brain image at that time point. After this, the scaled waveform of each signal was filtered by using a bandpass filter (0.01-0.08 Hz) to reduce the effect of low-frequency drift and high-frequency artifacts related to head motion and physiological noise including respiration and cardiac cycle. The head motion parameters, white matter signals, and cerebrospinal fluid signals were then used as covariates of multiple linear regression. Subsequently, the Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the time signals of all ROIs and normalized to   z  -scores by using Fisher's   r   to   z   transformation. Statistically significant (  p   < 0.05) correlation coefficient was considered a valid connectivity and used to describe the edge of the motor network. For each patient, two motor networks were obtained pre- and post-rTMS. A paired   t  -test was employed to observe the significantly changed connectivities between regions after rTMS for the HF-rTMS group and LF-rTMS group separately. \n\n\n### 2.8. Correlation Analysis \n  \nTo further verify the consistent performance between the functional connectivity of the motor network and motor function, we computed the Pearson correlation coefficients between the values of functional connectivity changes and motor assessment score changes as well in each group. The statistical analysis was conducted by using a threshold of   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n### 2.9. Statistical Analysis \n  \nStatistics for demographics and cognitive test scores were calculated with appropriate chi-squared (  χ  ), ANCOVA, or Student's   t  -tests. Statistical parametric and nonparametric tests were used depending on the type of scale and nature of the variable distribution. ANCOVA with age and gender as covariates was performed to determine the main effect of rTMS, followed by post hoc two-sample   t  -tests for multiple comparisons. Paired   t  -tests were conducted to assess the changes of cognitive function postintervention within each group. The significance was set at   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Behavioral Information \n  \nThe demographic characteristics and neurological examinations of HF-rTMS, LF-rTMS, and sham groups are summarized in  . The mean and standard deviation (SD) of age, the time since stroke (days), and the FMA, BI, and NIHSS of patients of pre- and post-rTMS are all provided in the table. There are no significant differences among the three groups in age, gender, time since stroke (days), or clinical performances at baseline. Compared to baseline, both the motor function and daily living ability postintervention were all significantly improved according to the results of the two-factor ANCOVA which revealed significant main effects of “time” for the FMA, BI, and NIHSS (  p   < 0.001). The significant interaction between “group” and “time” was also found for the FMA (  F   = 13.023,   p   < 0.001) and BI (  F   = 6.021,   p   = 0.006) scores. Post hoc   t  -tests revealed that NIHSS scores were significantly lower in both rTMS groups compared to the sham group (HF-rTMS vs. sham,   p   = 0.028; LF-rTMS vs. sham,   p   = 0.020). The paired   t  -test revealed significantly improved FMA, BI, and NIHSS scores in the three groups after rTMS treatment relative to pre-rTMS (  p   < 0.05). All the score changes of FMA, BI, and NIHSS scores after rTMS were bigger in the HF-rTMS group relative to LF-rTMS and sham groups. During the rTMS sessions, no discomfort was reported from any patients in three groups. \n\n\n### 3.2. Changes of Functional Connectivity of the Motor Network \n  \nAfter the group ICA analysis, the spatial independent component image of the motor network was extracted for each patient. These image data of both HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS groups were used to investigate the influence of rTMS therapy on the functional connectivity of the motor network. Compared to pre-rTMS, the significantly increased functional connectivity was observed in bilateral M1, SMA, and contralesional PMA after rTMS (  p   < 0.05, AlphaSim correction, and cluster size > 197) (  and  ). In addition, to further clarify the distinction of HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS on the modulation of functional connectivity of the motor network, respectively, the comparison between pre- and post-rTMS in the HF group and LF-rTMS group was performed separately. Significantly increased functional connectivity was observed in the ipsilesional M1, SMA, and PMA after HF-rTMS (  p   < 0.05, AlphaSim correction, and cluster size > 219) ( ). In contrast, the enhanced functional connectivities were observed in the contralesional M1 and bilateral SMA in the LF-rTMS group after rTMS (  p   < 0.05, AlphaSim correction, and cluster size > 213) ( ). Furthermore, decreased functional connectivity was detected in the bilateral SMA as well. \n\n\n### 3.3. Changes of Functional Connectivities of the Intramotor Network \n  \nTo validate the modulation of rTMS on the network pathway between brain regions of the motor network, the functional connectivity intramotor network was calculated with the selected peak coordinates in  . The symmetric location homologous to the contralesional PMA (-33, -7, and 61) and SMA (9, 2, and 61) was selected for the two regions which did not show significant changes after rTMS. The comparisons of functional connectivity of the intramotor network pre- and post-rTMS within each group and between HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS groups after rTMS were also conducted.   demonstrates statistically significant functional connectivity and changes of the motor network pre- and post-rTMS in the HF-rTMS group and LF-rTMS group and between two groups. The disconnectivity induced by stroke at baseline was basically recovered after rTMS, especially among the ipsilesional motor-related brain regions and between regions of the ipsilesional and contralesional hemisphere. Although most of the connectivity did not reach a statistically significant level, these findings revealed the reconnection within the motor network of the affected hemisphere and with the unaffected hemisphere after rTMS. \n\nThe significantly increased functional connectivities were detected between the ipsilesional M1, ipsilesional SMA, and contralesional PMA, between contralesional M1 and contralesional SMA, and between contralesional SMA, ipsilesional SMA, and contralesional PMA in the HF-rTMS group. No significant functional connectivity changes were observed in the LF-rTMS group. Significantly higher functional connectivity was found between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional PMA in HF-rTMS relative to the LF-rTMS group as well. These findings suggest the modulation of rTMS on functional interactions among the motor brain regions within the affected hemisphere and interaction of bilateral hemispheres following treatment. \n\n\n### 3.4. Relationship between Functional Connectivity and Motor Performance \n  \nTo verify the relationship between the significantly changed functional connectivity and motor recovery alteration reflected by neurological examination, a Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated in both HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS groups. For the functional connectivity intramotor network, the increased functional connectivity between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional PMA (  r   = −0.678,   p   = 0.022) ( ) was significantly negatively correlated with the NIHSS improvement in the HF-rTMS group. No significant correlation result was detected in the LF-rTMS group and other functional connectivities of the motor network. This result may indicate the reconnection between the brain regions which may contribute to the restoration of motor function after HF-rTMS. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn this current study, both ICA and seed-based analyses were used to investigate the functional reorganization of the motor network of stroke patients with motor deficit after rTMS. The distinction between HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS on the modulation of the motor network was further discussed. We found that HF-rTMS prominently increased the functional connectivity of the motor network in the ipsilesional hemisphere, whereas LF-rTMS mainly focused on the contralesional hemisphere. Moreover, the interaction between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional PMA and between bilateral SMA may contribute more during the motor recovery with HF-rTMS therapy. Our findings suggest that the distinct functional restoration and reorganization within the motor network of HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS both may underlie the motor recovery. \n\nIn our study, significantly improved motor function was detected in both HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS groups relative to baseline and sham groups. Furthermore, greater changes of FMA, BI, and NIHSS were all found in the HF-rTMS group than in the patients in the LF-rTMS group. The positive effect of rTMS on the motor recovery and activities of daily living of stroke patients with motor dysfunction has been reported in several meta-analyses [ ,  ,  ]. In accordance with our results, one of the meta-analyses also found that HF-rTMS is more effective than LF-rTMS, but not significant [ ]. However, the opposite result was reported in another meta-analysis [ ]. Therefore, future investigation with more studies is necessary to validate the result. \n\nConsistent with the results of neurological examinations, significantly increased functional connectivity of the motor network was observed in both groups as well. Furthermore, the motor-related brain regions showing network changes were located in the ipsilesional hemisphere after HF-rTMS and in the contralesional hemisphere after LF-rTMS. These results could be explained with the distinct mechanisms of different modes of rTMS which suggested that HF-rTMS over the ipsilesional hemisphere could increase the cortical excitability of the damaged cortex; low-frequency rTMS over the contralesional hemisphere could potentially decrease abnormally increased inhibition to the lesioned M1 and promote the recovery of the damaged cortex [ ]. Several comprehensive studies on motor recovery in early stroke patients showed that both HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS could increase motor-evoked fMRI activation of the ipsilesional motor area which were also positively significantly correlated with motor function at postintervention in M1 [ – ]. The increased fMRI activation in ipsilesional M1 was observed in patients with good motor outcome as well [ ]. Therefore, both the excited rTMS over the ipsilesional M1 and the inhibitory rTMS over the contralesional hemisphere have shown promise in enhancing stroke patients' recovery [ ]. \n\nExcept for different motor network changes, more significant functional connectivities intramotor network was found in the HF-rTMS group between the ipsilesional motor cortex and contralesional motor areas. The increased functional connectivity between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional PMA was also observed significantly related to the motor improvement. Additionally, this connectivity was also found higher in the HF-rTMS group than in the LF-rTMS group. Several previous studies have proved the crucial role of contralesional PMA, in particular, the dorsal PMA, in motor function and motor recovery. After stroke, fMRI investigations showed more activation in the contralesional PMA during the movement of the affected limb and were prominent in patients with poor motor recovery [ – ]. Such activity changes may imply the associated motor recovery. Inhibitory low-frequency rTMS over contralesional PMA also could slow the affected finger movement, in particular in more impaired patients, suggesting the functional recruitment of contralesional PMA in motor recovery [ ]. This results also demonstrated its adaptive compensation for an injured motor cortex after stroke. Further studies on behavior, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological validate that motor impairment and recovery after stroke could be explained with the specificity of PMA to the process of action selection [ – ]. Moreover, a concurrent TMS-fMRI study further found the physiological influence of contralesional PMA on ipsilesional M1 [ ]. Furthermore, stronger promotional influence between them was associated with greater clinical and neuropsychological impairment during hand grip in stroke patients. Dual-site TMS studies also found that TMS-induced activation changes in contralesional PMA have a causal impact on ipsilesional M1 at short latencies [ ,  ], so a likely alternative route by which contralesional PMA could exert control over ipsilesional finger movement is via interhemispheric connections with contralateral M1 [ ]. Therefore, these evidences suggest that contralesional PMA may be positioned to mediate functional recovery of motor function after stroke. The finding of significantly increased functional connectivity between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional PMA after rTMS may be explained by these above-mentioned theories and prove its contribution to motor recovery during high-frequency rTMS therapy. \n\nSignificant functional connectivity between ipsilesional and contralesional M1 was also observed after rTMS in both HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS groups, which was impaired after stroke. A previous study reported that increased functional connectivity between bilateral M1 was significantly correlated with the improvement in the upper limb section of FMA which was detected after the motor imagery training combined with conventional rehabilitation therapy [ ]. Another study with acupuncture treatment also observed increased functional connectivity between bilateral M1 [ ]. In addition, prior to treatment, several studies found significantly decreased interhemispheric functional connectivity between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional M1 after stroke [ ,  – ]. One study suggested that the transcallosal connections between bilateral M1 was also associated with motor recovery [ ]. Therefore, our finding may indicate the efficacy and modulatory effect of high- and low-frequency rTMS on the motor network. \n\nIn considering the whole brain, stroke induces interhemispheric changes and not just the neural activity and functional connectivity in the affected and unaffected hemisphere [ ]. Therefore, according to the model of interhemispheric interaction, motor recovery after stroke may be linked to rebalancing of asymmetric interhemispheric excitability and connectivity. This theory also confirmed the rationale of neuromodulation techniques to suppress unaffected motor cortex excitability and facilitate affected motor cortex excitability [ ]. Noninvasive treatments including rTMS and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) were both mainly performed to restore abnormal interhemispheric balance by facilitating ipsilesional M1 excitability or by inhibiting contralesional M1 excitability [ ,  ,  ,  ]. They observed slightly but not significantly increased intrahemispheric connectivity of the ipsilesional M1 after stimulation with both rTMS and tDCS [ ,  ]. This is in accordance with our results between the ipsilesional M1 and PMA. The functional role of SMA for motor recovery has been proven for a long time. The functional connectivity increase between the ipsilesional M1 and contralesional SMA demonstrated the efficacy of rTMS. Moreover, significant changes in neurochemicals were detected in the affected M1 as well when stimulating the unaffected M1. They believed that interhemispheric connectivity is also particularly important in functional recovery after stroke. In our study, more interhemispheric functional connectivity changes were observed which may indicate that functional compensation from the contralesional hemisphere may play a more important role during motor recovery. rTMS may realize its effect by modulating the functional connectivities between ipsilesional and contralesional motor-related brain areas. Direct intervention of HF-rTMS over the affected M1 may contribute more to the motor recovery which could explain the more increased functional connectivity of the motor network. \n\nSome limitations exist in our study. First, a relatively small sample size was used in our study which may influence the results. We only included 11 subjects for the HF-rTMS group, 12 subjects for the LF-rTMS group, and 10 subjects for the sham group. It is difficult to ensure the cohorts of patients, but, in this study, there was no significant difference among the three groups in demographic characteristics, neurological examinations, and functional connectivity at baseline. Studies with more stroke patients are needed to verify our results. Second, only the core regions of the motor network were selected to characterize the functional reorganization. Subcortical brain regions also could be considered to fully understand the network changes after rTMS. Third, after completing the arranged sessions, the durability and influence on the motor network of HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS interventions were not made with the postintervention measurements. \n\nTherefore, further studies with large sample sizes and long-term follow-up assessments are needed to interpret and verify the results more accurately. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nOur study demonstrates that both HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS interventions could promote the motor rehabilitation in patients with stroke. Strikingly, HF-rTMS over the ipsilesional M1 may be more beneficial to the reorganization of the motor network and remodeling of motor cortical plasticity which realize greater contribution to the motor recovery. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"a9159627de45ced905d3d85107bdfd6f"},

The study described here was designed to explore the divergence of acupuncture at Taixi (KI3) on spontaneous activity of brain regions and functional connectivity (FC) between healthy youth and elder with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 20 healthy young volunteers and 20 healthy elders underwent 10-minute-resting-state fMRI before acupuncture, and then acupuncture at Taixi (KI3) for 3 minutes; after withdrawing the needles, volunteers underwent a second fMRI scan for 10 minutes. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and large-scale FC analysis using Power 264 atlas were utilized to analyze the changes of brain spontaneous activity. Compared with the resting state, the decreased ReHo after acupuncture at KI3 in both groups were concentrated in the left postcentral, right paracentral lobule, and right SMA. Moreover, the subjects in the HY group showed declined ReHo in brain regions involving the right lingual and precentral. However, those subjects in the HE group presented decreased ReHo in the right postcentral and precentral, left supramarginal gyrus and SMA, and both cingulum middle after needling in KI3. Compared with the resting state, the HY group in the postneedling state showed lower mean intranetwork FC in sensory/somatomotor and subcortical network. And the internetwork FC between sensory/somatomotor and dorsal attention had significantly decreased after acupuncture. Furthermore, the internetwork FC between subcortical and dorsal attention and between subcortical and cerebellar showed the most obvious elevations after needling in the HY group. In the elder group, both FCs of internetwork and intranetwork primarily involving sensory/somatomotor, cingulo-opercular, and dorsal attention were declined after acupuncture. These results indicated that acupuncture at KI3 had heterogeneous acupuncture effects in different age groups. Our study led to converging evidence supporting the acupuncture effect segregation of different condition subjects and supporting evidence for prevention and treatment with acupuncture in the future. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nAcupuncture has been applied in China for thousands of years and has emerged rapidly gaining popularity in Western alternative and complementary medicine practice for its therapeutic effects [ ]. Many studies have demonstrated that acupuncture plays an important role in stroke rehabilitation, pain relief, cognitive function improvement, etc. [ – ]. The biological mechanism, however, remains to be clarified. The blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI (fMRI) techniques have shed light on the issues involving the mechanism of acupuncture, and the application of fMRI in the research of acupuncture has made abundant achievements in recent years. \n\nRecently, cumulative evidence from fMRI studies has shown that stimulating acupoint could induce changes of brain functional connectivity [ ]. For example, needling LV3 and LI4 points on patients with Alzheimer's Disease could enhance the functional connection in areas related to the hippocampus, which might be the potential mechanism of acupuncture to improve Alzheimer's Disease [ ]. In stroke patients, acupuncture at TE5 could increase the cooperation of bilateral sensorimotor networks [ ]. \n\nTaixi (KI3), one of the key acupoints of kidney meridian in the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been used to treat patients with cognitive impairment [ ], which has been supported by acupuncture studies in healthy volunteers: needling acupoint KI3 could increase connectivity between cognition-related regions [ ]. Moreover, a previous fMRI study [ ] has found that acupuncture at the same acupoint of different people has a different impact on brain functional connectivity (FC). However, as we know, there were few studies to explore the impact of needling KI3 on brain large-scale FC in healthy people with different ages, which is essential for understanding the mechanism of needling. \n\nThe question of how needling at acupoint KI3 can produce different effects on different people in brain functional connectivity has been a matter of interest in the present study. Importantly, previous regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis [ ] found that after acupuncture at KI3 of healthy subjects, the ReHo value of Brodmann area (BA) 7 decreased. However, another similar ReHo analysis [ ] showed that after real acupuncture at KI3, ReHo values were increased in the right sublobar region and BA 10 and were decreased in BA 31. Considering that these studies employed volunteers with diverse age ranges, we may attribute the result inconsistencies between different studies to the demographic data. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that the brain FCs can be heterogeneous between healthy youths and elders after acupuncture at KI3. \n\nCurrently, numerous approaches have been developed and used to study the resting-state fMRI, such as the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) [ ], fractional ALFF (fALFF) [ ], voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) [ ], ReHo [ ], and large-scale FC. These clustering solutions may reveal physiological or pathological effects from different layers. However, some studies have recognized that ReHo analysis achieved better performance in depict clinical trait than ALFF or fALFF [ ,  ]. In addition, VMHC focuses on exploring the differences in homotopic coordination (e.g., sex differences), not the whole-brain network. Moreover, large-scale FC are collections of widespread brain regions showing functional connectivity, which provide a coherent framework for understanding functional changes by offering a neural model of how different functions emerge when different conditions of intervention are adopted. Therefore, in the present study, we applied ReHo and large-scale FC analysis to test the hypothesis that acupuncture at KI3 in young and elderly people could induce heterogeneous acupuncture effects. This is practically considering that in the future, we may adopt different stimulation protocols when encountering the same conditions in youth and elder. \n\n\n## 2. Material and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nThe volunteers in the study were recruited in the First Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University. Healthy elder volunteers were assessed by complete physical and neuropsychological examinations including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The inclusion criteria for the two groups are as follows: (1) right-handed, (2) regular diet and normal sleep patterns, (3) no neurological or psychiatric disorders reported, (4) no drug dependence and alcohol addiction, (5) moderate weight (BMI is 18.5–23.9), and (6) no brain lesions were observed by a routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University (approval number: KY2019007). \n\n\n### 2.2. Image Acquisition \n  \nThe fMRI data acquisition was performed with a 3.0 Tesla (MRI Achieva, Philips Medical Systems, Nederland) MRI scanner using echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR 2000 ms, TE 30 ms, matrix 64∗64, FOV 240∗240∗152, voxel size 3.75 mm∗3.75 mm∗4 mm, flip angle 90°, 38 slices, orientation transverse, scan order interleaved, slice thickness 4 mm, gap 0, duration 546 s). Foam padding and earplugs served to control head motion and reduce the influence of scanner noise during the scanning. And subjects were told to hold still, keep their eyes closed, and think of nothing in particular. Before examination, the volunteers were instructed to rest for 20 minutes and were informed of the whole experimental procedure. The subjects first underwent a structural 3D T1-weighted scan (TR 8 ms, TE 4 ms, 256∗256 matrix, flip angle 7°, voxel size 1 mm∗1 mm∗1 mm, slices 160, slice thickness 2 mm) covering the whole brain. Then, fMRI data of resting state before needling were obtained (270 time points). After that, 3-minute-acupuncture stimuli on KI3 were performed. Subsequently, a second fMRI data (270 time points) in the postneedling state was acquired ( ). \n\n\n### 2.3. Acupuncture Intervention \n  \nAll acupuncture operations were performed by the same acupuncturist with more than 5 years of clinical experience. The location of KI3 was set out in accordance with Name and Location of Acupoints: Chinese National Standards GB12346-90 (2006). Disposable sterile acupuncture needles (0.25 mm∗30 mm, Zhongyan, Beijing, China) were utilized for the acupuncture. The needles were inserted perpendicularly to a depth ca. 2 cm at KI3. To induce and enhance the needling (de qi) sensation, the acupuncturist manipulated the inserted needle by rotating the needle clockwise and counterclockwise with + or -360 degrees in each rotation, and lifting-thrusting of a needle. The acupuncturist performed each rotating and lifting-thrusting alternately with each lasting for 30 seconds. The two methods of needle manipulation were performed for 3 minutes in all. \n\n\n### 2.4. Data Preprocessing \n  \nInitial resting-state fMRI statistics were preprocessed using Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI 2.3 (DPARSF.  ) [ ] which builds on Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8,  ). The preprocessing steps included in the study were as follows: we converted the original data of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format to NIfTI format; then, the first 4 time points were discarded; the remaining 266 time points were corrected for slice timing to the middle slice and were realigned to correct for head movements; subjects with more than 2 mm displacement in any of the   x  ,   y  , or   z   directions were excluded from this study. After that, the Friston 24-parameter model [ ] was employed to regress head motion effects out of the realigned data; meanwhile, linear trends, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal, and global average signal were regressed by multiple linear regression analysis; subsequently, the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) [ ] tool was used to compute the transformations from native individual space to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space with a voxel size of 3∗3∗3 mm; the voxel-specific framewise displacement (FD) of each subject was computed using Jenkinsons' method [ ,  ]. And the mean Jenkinson FD of each subject was used as a covariate in the group comparisons of ReHo. Finally, we performed temporal bandpass filtering (0.01-0.08 Hz) across time series. After preprocessing, data from 20 subjects in resting state and postneedling state functional images were contained in statistical analyses. These preprocessed data without smooth were used in the later ReHo analysis. \n\nGaussian spatial smoothing was performed (FWHM = 4 mm) for the functional data in the later large-scale FC analysis. \n\n\n### 2.5. ReHo Analysis \n  \nAfter data preprocessing, ReHo analysis, using the brain function of data processing software named DPARSF to calculate the whole brain around each individual element and its adjacent 27 individual elements on the time series of consistency, get the voxel KCC; the whole brain around each individual element KCC values divided by the whole brain of all voxel KCC get standardized ReHo diagram of mean values. Finally, the ReHo graph is smoothed, that is, an isotropic Gaussian kernel with FWHM of 6 mm is convolved to improve the signal-to-noise ratio [ ,  ]. \n\n\n### 2.6. Large-Scale Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nAfter the fMRI data preprocessing, we used MATLAB toolbox GRETNA ( ) [ ], a graphics theory network analysis toolbox of image connectivity, to build functional brain networks. The Power 264 atlas [ ] produced by Power et al. and used for the primary analysis was employed as a template to extract the time series. Power 264 functional ROIs was composed of 14 functional networks including sensory/somatomotor hand, sensory/somatomotor mouth, cingulo-opercular task control, auditory, default mode, memory retrieval, ventral attention, visual, frontoparietal task control, salience, subcortical, cerebellar, dorsal attention, and uncertain. In this study, the whole cerebral cortex was divided into 264 cortical and subcortical regions by using this template. The mean time series of each node was extracted. Then, pairwise functional connectivity was estimated among the time series by calculating linear Pearson correlation coefficients. After that, the mean intra- and internetworks of FC were calculated by using the mean value of edges in corresponding subnetworks. \n\n\n### 2.7. Functional Relevance Analysis of ReHo Results \n  \nTo determine the functional relevance of ReHo difference regions, the Behavioral Analysis tool in the public domain Multi-image Analysis GUI (MANGO; Research Imaging Institute, UTHSCSA, San Antonio) software was employed (see method description [ ]). The Behavioral Analysis performs regional behavior analysis based on user-defined ROIs by utilizing data from the BrainMap database ( ). In this study, we defined ROIs based on the clusters of ReHo results. The ROIs have been normalized to Talairach space and been loaded into MANGO. The Behavioral Analysis tool then automatically listed each behavioral subdomain associated with loaded ROI and calculates the associated   z  -score for each behavior. A positive   z  -score larger than 3.0 was considered significant after a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (  P   < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons) [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.8. Statistical Analysis \n  \nA paired   t   test was used to compare the ReHo results between postneedling and resting state in healthy youth and elder groups, respectively. And the mean Jenkinson FD was used as a covariate to eliminate the disturbance of microhead motion. The statistical maps were GRF corrected at a voxel level   P   < 0.001 and cluster level   P   < 0.05 (one-tailed). Edge connected cluster connectivity criterion, rmm = 5. Then, using a MATLAB toolbox xjview ( ) with Anatomical Automatic Labeling template 2 (AAL2) [ ] mapped the location of voxels that had significantly different ReHo values between conditions on MNI coordinate space. \n\nA paired   t   test was used to compare changes of functional network connection between postacupuncture state at KI3 and resting state in the youth group and the elder group, respectively. False discovery rate (FDR) correction with a threshold   P   < 0.05 was used for multiple comparisons. Cohen's   d   value was calculated to depict the effect size between two variables. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Sample Composition \n  \nTwenty healthy young (aged 24.7 ± 2.9, HY) and twenty healthy elderly (aged 56.8 ± 7.2, HE) right-handed volunteers were included in the study. The mean Jenkinson FDs of the youth and elder groups showed no significant differences in both resting state and postneedling state. The characteristics of the subjects in healthy youth and elder groups are shown in  . \n\n\n### 3.2. Different ReHo Alterations after Needling KI3 in HYs and HEs \n  \nThe data of postneedling state fMRI in both the HY group and the HE group were compared to their own data of resting-state fMRI. Three clusters (5 structures) and 5 clusters (10 structures) were yielded in the HY group and the HE group, respectively. The most striking finding is that the largest altered ReHo difference regions between postneeding state and resting state are located in the occipital and frontal lobe in the HY group. In the HE group, however, the largest altered ReHo difference regions are located in the parietal and frontal lobe. More specifically, it was noted that some brain regions including left postcentral, right paracentral lobule, and right SMA in both groups showed decreased ReHo after acupuncture. Moreover, compared with resting state, brain regions involving right lingual and precentral present declined ReHo in the HY group. In addition, downgraded ReHo after needling KI3 in the HE group were found in right postcentral and precentral, left supramarginal gyrus and SMA, and both cingulum middle ( ,  ). \n\n\n### 3.3. HYs and HEs Showing Different Changes of Intra- and Internetwork FC Postneedling \n  \nAfter preprocessing of the neuroimaging data, time series for the Power 264 functional ROIs of each subject were extracted. Then, the average intra- and internetwork connections for each functional network of individuals were computed. And the intra- and internetwork FC in the postneedling state and resting state were compared in the HY group and the HE group, respectively ( ). \n\n\n### 3.4. HY Group \n  \nCompared with the resting state, the HY group in the postneedling state showed lower mean intranetwork FC in sensory/somatomotor (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.9) and subcortical network (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.9). In addition, the internetwork FC between sensory/somatomotor and dorsal attention had significantly decreased after acupuncture (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.8). Furthermore, the internetwork FC between subcortical and dorsal attention (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = 0.7) and subcortical and cerebellar (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = 0.7) showed the most obvious elevations after needling in the HY group ( ). \n\n\n### 3.5. HE Group \n  \nLarge-scale FC analysis indicated that compared with resting-state fMRI, both FCs of internetwork and intranetwork were declined after needling in the elder group. We found that the average connections of intranetwork such as sensory/somatomotor (FDR   P   < 0.01,   d   = −0.9), cingulo-opercular (FDR   P   < 0.01,   d   = −0.9), auditory (FDR   P   < 0.01,   d   = −0.9), default (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.8), visual (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.7), frontoparietal (FDR   P   < 0.01,   d   = −0.8), salience (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.7), and dorsal attention (FDR   P   < 0.01,   d   = −0.9) networks significantly decreased in HEs after acupuncture. \n\nThe effect of acupuncture on internetwork FC primarily involved sensory/somatomotor, cingulo-opercular, and dorsal attention networks. It was noted that the internetwork FC between sensory/somatomotor and cingulo-opercular (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.9), default (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.7), salience (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.7), dorsal attention (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.8), between cingulo-opercular and auditory (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.9), frontoparietal (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.7), between frontoparietal and dorsal attention (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.8), and between salience and dorsal attention (FDR   P   < 0.05,   d   = −0.7) were significantly declined after needling in the HE group ( ). \n\n\n### 3.6. Functional Relevance Differences of ReHo Clusters from HYs and HEs \n  \nTo further explore the heterogeneous acupuncture effects of KI3 on HYs and HEs, we defined the ReHo clusters as ROIs and performed behavioral domain analysis. We found that the functions of ROIs from both HYs and HEs are involved in Action/Execution (speech), Action/Execution (unspecified), and Cognition/Language (speech). However, Cognition/Language (semantics) was only observed in clusters from the HY group. Perception/Somesthesis (pain) and Perception/Somesthesis (unspecified) were only obtained in clusters from the HE group ( ). \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we applied ReHo and large-scale FC analysis to detect the acupuncture effects in HY and HE groups. We found that after needling, both HY and HE groups showed significant changes in ReHo and large-scale FC, compared with the resting state. Strikingly, stimulation at the same acupoint KI3 could cause some different acupuncture effects between youth and elder groups. Our study demonstrated that there are divergences in acupuncture effect when stimulating the same acupoint in subjects with different conditions, which would be practical in the stimulation strategies selecting in the future. \n\nBy ReHo analysis, we found that both HEs and HYs showed decreased ReHo in the postcentral gyrus, SMA, and PCL after needling KI3. This congruency in ReHo differential regions postneedling between HY and HE groups indicated that the method used in the present study was stable and reproducible. Meanwhile, considering that the postcentral gyrus played a prominent role in the sensory aspects of pain and a previous study has reported that the functions of KI3 involve pain relief [ ,  ], moreover, SMA might receive higher regional cerebral blood flow across pain modalities [ ], which supported that needling at KI3 had a synergistic effect on treating pain. We speculated that this result might be linked to the mechanism of needling KI3 in treating pain-related and cognition impairment diseases. \n\nIt was noted that HEs and HYs had different ReHo differential brain regions after needling KI3. Decreased ReHo in lingual and precentral in the HY group were found, while the ReHo after needling in the HE group decreased in postcentral, precentral, supramarginal gyrus, SMA, and both cingulum middle. Parts of these results were consistent with previous studies [ ,  ,  ]. These findings further indicated that acupuncture of KI3 had different acupuncture effects in different age groups. \n\nThe different acupuncture effects of KI3 in HY and HE groups were reproduced in the latter large-scale FC analysis. There were more subnetworks with decreased connectivity after acupuncture in the average intranetwork of HEs. In addition, we found the average internetwork FC in the HY group including subcortical and dorsal attention, cerebellar increased, and sensory/somatomotor and dorsal attention decreased after needling acupoint. In the HE group, more average intra- and internetwork FC involving sensory/somatomotor, dorsal attention, cingulo-opercular, etc., were decreased by acupuncture. These results were consistent with previous fMRI studies, which suggested that acupuncture regulates the activity of some cortical and subcortical brain regions [ – ]. \n\nNotably, the enhanced average internetwork FC involving subcortical networks were not obtained in HEs and the HE group showed decreased internetwork FC mainly related to nonsubcortical networks such as sensory/somatomotor network, cingulo-opercular task control network, auditory network, and default mode network. These findings further supported acupuncture effects in different age groups. We might explain these results by the aging-related neuroplasticity. There were heterogeneous aging effects in the evolutions of FC with aging, and these changes in FC could be altered by external intervention [ – ]. \n\nFrom the functional relevance analysis, we found that the heterogeneous acupuncture effects in ReHo clusters might cause functional heterogeneity of acupuncture at KI3 between HY and HE groups. The functions of ROIs deprived from ReHo clusters of both groups were involved in Cognition and Action/Execution, while the function involving Perception/Somesthesis was only obtained in clusters from the HE group. These findings might indicate that acupuncture at KI3 could affect functions involving Cognition, Action/Execution, and Perception/Somesthesis. Given that changes of inhibition or excitation in brain regions played an important role in the functional evolution of aging [ – ], we may attribute the heterogeneous acupuncture effects between youth and elder groups to the changes of balance between inhibition and excitation. These findings further suggested the heterogeneous acupuncture effects of KI3 on different groups. More importantly, this study revealed the acupuncture effect of KI3 in different age groups from a neurological perspective, which will provide evidences for the application of acupuncture in prevention and treatment in the future. \n\nOne limitation in the study is that the subjects in this experiment are all healthy people. In the forthcoming studies, patients will be included as subjects to detect the acupuncture effects on brain functional network connectivity in the pathological state. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn this functional imaging approach based on ReHo and large-scale FC analysis for detecting the changes of ReHo and FC, we demonstrated that the acupuncture of KI3 had different acupuncture effects in different age groups. After needling KI3, significant differences in ReHo and FC are observed, which may suggest that the influence of acupuncture on the brain spontaneous activity and functional network are important mechanisms for the neurological effect of acupuncture. In conclusion, our study revealed the heterogeneous acupuncture effect of KI3 in different age groups from a neurological perspective, which will provide supporting evidence for the usage of acupuncture in prevention and treatment in the future. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"5dd2669eabf4c9683bb6eb0aee73e3b0"},

Recent research in substance use disorders has focused on three brain networks termed the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN). The purpose of this study was to examine the functional connectivity of those three networks in opioid use disorder (OUD) subjects compared to healthy control subjects (HC). \n\n\n## Methods: \n  \nThe present study investigated functional connectivity differences between OUD subjects compared to HC using independent component analysis. This study also examined the relationship between functional connectivity and negative urgency scores, as well as compared the functional connectivity of severe OUD to mild or moderate OUD. \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nIn OUD subjects (n=25) compared to HC (n=25), a cluster in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex within the left ECN had significantly weaker functional connectivity. No significant differences were found between groups for the functional connectivity of the DMN, SN, or right ECN. No significant associations were found between functional connectivity and negative urgency, and no differences were found between severe OUD and mild or moderate OUD. \n\n\n## Conclusion: \n  \nThese novel preliminary results suggest that ECN functional connectivity may differ between OUD and HC. This finding is consistent with previous research showing altered executive function in OUD and supports further examination of ECN functional connectivity in association with treatment response in OUD. Given our relatively small sample size (50 subjects total; 25 subjects per group), our results should be treated as preliminary for hypothesis generation, and replication will be needed in future studies. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOpioid Use Disorder (OUD) represents a significant public health issue, and there remains room for improvement in the understanding of the neurobiology underlying OUD. Among the tools used for studying OUD neurobiology are functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of brain neural functional connectivity. Functional connectivity measures the statistical dependence between brain regions of spontaneous fluctuations in the fMRI signal [ , ]. Resting state fMRI functional connectivity can provide information about how the brain is organized into functional networks and how those functional networks may differ in OUD. Zhang and Volkow (2019) have reviewed the addiction functional connectivity literature with focus on the Default Mode Network (DMN). That review reported differences in substance users’ functional connectivity within sub-systems of the DMN and between the DMN and other networks, such as the Salience Network (SN) and the Executive Control Network (ECN) [ ]. The DMN, SN, and ECN are three networks possibly related to addiction and psychopathology in general [ , ]. It has been suggested that functional connectivity within and among the DMN, SN, and ECN is altered in substance use disorders, possibly reflecting salient environmental cues (SN) interacting more with circuits associated with craving (DMN) and less with circuits associated with executive control (ECN) [ , , ]. \n\nSeveral studies of OUD have assessed functional connectivity within the DMN, with inconsistent findings. While several studies found decreased functional connectivity within the DMN, some studies found increased functional connectivity [ – ]. Fewer studies have assessed functional connectivity within the SN and ECN [ , ]. Both Upadhyay et al. (2010) and Wang et al. (2016) found decreased functional connectivity within the SN in OUD subjects relative to healthy controls. Li et al. (2018) found increased functional connectivity between the left ECN and the right ECN in OUD, but to our knowledge there are no published studies which have addressed functional connectivity within the left ECN or right ECN in OUD [ ]. Furthermore, many of the above-referenced studies used seed-based functional connectivity methods which may be more prone to head motion confounds than independent component analysis (ICA) [ ]. ICA allows for quantitative investigation of whole networks without the need for selection of a seed region of interest and can better account for artifacts compared to seed-based methods which can be influenced by spatial confounds [ ]. ICA with subsequent analysis using the dual regression module of FSL software ( ) considers both amplitude and shape of the signal time-course of resting state networks [ , ]. Head motion can mimic amplitude effects, and dual regression can more accurately localize these amplitude effects of motion and thus avoid misinterpreting them as differences in connectivity [ ]. \n\nThe present study used ICA to test for functional connectivity differences between OUD subjects and non-drug using healthy control subjects (HC) within the DMN, SN, and ECN. Previous research using ICA has shown the ECN to be lateralized as left ECN (LECN) and right ECN (RECN) components, and therefore we studied both LECN and RECN components in our ICA analysis [ ]. The present study also tested for associations of functional connectivity with negative urgency scores (NU) across all subjects. NU is an aspect of impulsivity, which has been linked to executive control, and is described as the tendency to act rashly in response to negative affect [ , ]. NU has been associated with greater opioid use and future opioid use in a chronic pain patient sample, but has not yet been studied in association with functional connectivity in OUD [ ]. \n\nWe hypothesized that OUD subjects would have lower within-network DMN and lower within-network SN functional connectivity relative to HC, based on previous findings in OUD individuals who were actively using illicit opioids and/or taking methadone or buprenorphine [ , ]. We hypothesized that OUD subjects would score higher in NU, similar to previous findings in opioid users and other substance users [ , ]. We also hypothesized that NU scores would negatively correlate with SN functional connectivity of both groups based on a previous study using tobacco users and the proposed associations of the SN with salience detection and evaluation [ , ]. We also performed exploratory analyses of associations between NU scores and the within-network functional connectivity of the DMN, LECN, and RECN. We also planned exploratory analyses to compare between groups the within-network functional connectivity of the LECN and RECN. All of these hypotheses were registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF) prior to any data analysis in this study [ ]. The present study also compared post-hoc the functional connectivity of OUD subjects with different levels of OUD severity. To investigate the effects of heterogeneity of our OUD sample, we also performed post-hoc analyses of functional connectivity of OUD with urine drug screens positive for buprenorphine or methadone compared to OUD with urine drug screens positive only for illicit opioids. Also, to investigate the effects of heterogeneity, we examined the relationship between functional connectivity and time since last opioid use in the OUD subjects. Given our relatively small sample size (50 subjects total; 25 subjects per group), our results should be treated as preliminary for hypothesis generation, and replication will be needed in future studies. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects and procedures \n  \nAll study procedures were approved by the Virginia Commonwealth University Institutional Review Board. OUD subjects were recruited from the Richmond, Virginia, community outpatient setting by using flyers and in-person recruitment at addiction treatment clinics. To obtain a more representative sample of the OUD population that could be seen clinically, no restrictions regarding current drug use were imposed during recruitment. HC subjects were recruited by using flyers and other advertisements. Written informed consent and a thorough screening were obtained, including a medical history, physical examination, and psychiatric and substance use histories conducted using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version 5 (DSM-5) [ ]. Inclusion criteria were DSM-5 diagnosed OUD (for OUD only) and age between 18 and 70 years. Exclusion criteria were any history of schizophrenia, seizure disorder, significant head trauma, any changes to psychoactive medications within 30 days prior to the study period, any other DSM-5 Substance Use Disorder with a severity diagnosis greater than the subject’s DSM-5 OUD severity diagnosis (Mild, Moderate, Severe), or DSM-5 Severe Alcohol Use Disorder. In addition, HC subject exclusion criteria were any history of substance use disorder. Subjects were seen for a screening visit and three additional visits in which they completed several behavioral measures, an MRI screening and mock MRI session, and an MRI scan. Participants were asked to refrain from smoking 1 hour before and drinking caffeine 3 hours before their MRI scan. Urine drug screens (UDS) and alcohol breath screens were obtained during each visit. 25 OUD and 25 HC subjects were included in the final analysis. Greater detail regarding the subjects and procedures is presented in  . \n\n\n### Behavioral measures \n  \n#### Negative urgency: \n  \nNU scores were extracted from a short form of the UPPS-P scale (Urgency, lack of Premeditation, lack of Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, and Positive Urgency scale) [ , ]. \n\n\n#### Opioid use: \n  \nThe number of subjects with at least one UDS positive for different categories of opioids and non-opioid drugs are reported for descriptive purposes. \n\n\n#### OUD severity: \n  \nOUD severity was obtained from the DSM-5 severity diagnosis (Mild, Moderate, Severe). \n\nTime since last opioid use in hours was obtained by a clinician interview conducted immediately prior to the participant’s MRI scan. \n\nBehavioral and demographic data were analyzed using JMP statistical software (JMP, Version 14. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 1989–2019). Greater detail regarding the behavioral measures is presented in  . \n\n\n\n### MRI acquisition \n  \nMRI scans were acquired using the Philips Medical Systems (Best, Netherlands) Ingenia wide-bore dStream 3T MRI scanner, with a 32-channel receive head coil. Single shot gradient-echo echoplanar imaging (EPI) was used for acquiring fMRI data. The fMRI acquisition parameters were: SENSE in-plane acceleration factor 1.5, multiband factor 3, repetition time 1625 ms, echo time 30 ms, flip angle 52°, field of view 240 mm (anterior-to-posterior) × 240 mm (left-to-right) × 125.70 mm (foot-to-head), in-plane resolution 2.5 mm × 2.5 mm, 45 axial slices, slice thickness 2.5 mm, interslice gap 0.30 mm, 420 repetitions per run after 12 dummy acquisitions, and total duration 11 minutes 22 seconds. Subjects completed the resting state fMRI scan with eyes open while looking at a black fixation cross on a white screen. Greater detail regarding MRI acquisition parameters is available in  . \n\n\n### MRI preprocessing \n  \nInitial removal of signal outliers, heart rate physiologic noise correction, slice timing correction, spatial smoothing, and registration to a T1 anatomical scan were performed. Susceptibility-induced off-resonance field correction was conducted by FSL “topup” software ( ). Quality control for head motion was performed by eliminating fMRI runs which did not meet the Parkes et al. (2018) stringent criteria [ ]. Head motion re-alignment and signal correction was performed using the FSL MCFLIRT motion-correction program and ICA-AROMA, respectively [ – ]. Further denoising was performed using the aCompCor procedure implemented in CONN software ( , RRID:SCR_009550), and ICA components with possible motion-related structured noise are regressed out during the FSL dual regression procedure [ , ]. The denoised fMRI timeseries was transformed into MNI space. High pass filtering (cutoff=125 s), but not low pass filtering, was performed. Greater detail in the preprocessing steps is presented in  . \n\n\n### Functional connectivity analysis \n  \nGroup ICA maps were created using all subjects in both groups by FSL MELODIC (Multivariate Exploratory Linear Decomposition into Independent Components) ( ) with 30 components, the output of which was visually inspected to identify the DMN, SN, LECN, and RECN networks [ ]. Dual regression analysis was then performed in FSL to obtain the subject-specific component maps of parameter estimates of functional connectivity, which were then used as the input to non-parametric permutations statistical tests using FSL’s Permutation Analysis of Linear Models (PALM) ( ) for comparison between groups [ , ]. The FSL standard Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) was used to identify statistically significant clusters of voxels while maintaining family-wise-error (FWE) control [ ]. We analyzed the regression of the subject-specific functional connectivity on NU scores for all subjects in both groups, and we also compared the functional connectivity of subjects with severe OUD to subjects with mild or moderate OUD. All reported p-values of functional connectivity results are FWE corrected for the number of voxels, the number of contrasts, and the 4 networks examined. \n\nTo examine the effects of heterogeneity in our OUD sample, we also performed two post-hoc analyses. In the first analysis, we compared OUD subjects with at least one UDS positive for buprenorphine or methadone to OUD subjects with UDS positive for illicit opioids only. In the second analysis, we analyzed the regression of the subject-specific functional connectivity on self-reported time since last opioid use, measured in hours. \n\nFor baseline variables (NU, education, and mean framewise displacement (mFD)) that statistically significantly differed between the two groups, we conducted a preliminary analysis of the regression of functional connectivity on the baseline variable to determine whether that variable should be included as a covariate in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) based on recommendations from a standard statistics textbook [ ]. Given that 17/25 OUD subjects were tobacco users while 0/25 HC subjects were tobacco users, we were unable to perform ANCOVA but instead compared the functional connectivity of tobacco using OUD subjects to non-tobacco using OUD subjects. \n\nGreater details of our functional connectivity analysis steps are in  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and behavioral results \n  \n#### Demographics: \n  \nThe mean, standard deviation, and range of age, years of education, and mFD of OUD and HC subjects are listed in  . Age did not significantly differ between groups (t=1.19, df=48, p=0.240). Years of education were significantly lower by 2.5 years in the OUD subjects (t=5.08, df=48, p<0.001) relative to HC. mFD was significantly higher by 0.03 mm in the OUD subjects (t=3.53, df=48, p<0.001) relative to HC. 10 out of the 25 OUD subjects were female and 12 out of the 25 HC subjects were female. A Chi-Square Test determined the groups did not differ significantly in sex (2=0.33, df=1, p=0.569). 16 out of 25 OUD subjects self-reported smoking tobacco products compared to 0 of the 25 HC subjects. \n\n\n#### OUD urine drug screens: \n  \nAll 25 OUD subjects had at least one UDS positive for any opioid (including buprenorphine or methadone). UDS results for OUD subjects are listed in  . \n\n\n#### Behavioral results: \n  \nThe mean, standard deviation, and range of NU scores of OUD and HC subjects are listed in  . OUD subjects scored significantly higher in NU than HC subjects (t=2.70, df=48, p=0.010). The proportions of OUD subjects with severe, moderate, and mild OUD are listed in  . The median, interquartile range (IQR), and range of hours since last opioid use are listed in  . \n\n\n\n### Functional connectivity between groups \n  \nComponent maps for the DMN, SN, LECN, and RECN, generated by FSL MELODIC from both groups combined, are displayed in  . As displayed in  , dual regression analysis showed that the OUD group had significantly weaker within-network functional connectivity relative to HC in a cluster (30 voxels; cluster peak at MNI coordinates (x=−16, y=19, z=52) mm) within the LECN (Cohen’s d=1.455, p=0.022 after FWE correction for voxels, contrasts, and the 4 networks examined). According to the Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas ( ), this cluster was in the left superior frontal gyrus. According to the histological study of Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic (1995), the entire cluster was within the coordinates of their broadly defined dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), with approximately half of the voxels in the cluster falling within their conservatively defined dlPFC [ ]. The mean functional connectivity parameter estimates output from stage 2 of the Dual Regression procedure for HC and OUD are listed in  . OUD functional connectivity was not greater than HC (p greater than 0.998) within the LECN. OUD and HC did not significantly differ in the within-network functional connectivity for any of the other 3 networks (p greater than 0.562). \n\n\n### Regression with NU \n  \nThe regression of functional connectivity on NU score was not significant for any of the 4 networks (p greater than 0.473) nor were there any significant NU × group interaction effects in any of the 4 networks (p greater than 0.454). \n\n\n### OUD severity functional connectivity comparison \n  \nGiven that there was only one OUD subject with a DSM-5 diagnosis of mild severity, mild and moderate severity OUD subjects were combined into one subgroup. Severe OUD and mild/moderate OUD did not significantly differ in functional connectivity within any of the 4 networks (p greater than 0.696). \n\n\n### Post-hoc analysis \n  \nOUD with at least one UDS positive for buprenorphine or methadone (n=16) and OUD with UDS positive for only illicit opioids (n=9) did not significantly differ in functional connectivity within any of the 4 networks (p greater than 0.179). The regression of functional connectivity on time since last opioid use was not significant for any of the 4 networks (p greater than 0.313). \n\n\n### Head motion and education regressions \n  \nThe regression of functional connectivity on mFD was not significant for any of the 4 networks (p greater than 0.246). The regression of functional connectivity on education was not significant for any of the 4 networks (p greater than 0.294). Thus, none of the baseline variables mFD, education, or NU met the criteria for inclusion as a covariate in ANCOVA, due to lack of a significant relationship of these variables with functional connectivity in this sample [ ]. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur results provide preliminary evidence that LECN functional connectivity may be weaker in OUD subjects compared to HC subjects. Differences in LECN resting state fMRI functional connectivity have been shown in cocaine use disorder and alcohol use disorder subjects relative to controls, but to our knowledge, this is the first published study to show differences in LECN resting state fMRI functional connectivity in OUD relative to HC [ – ]. These results need to be replicated, but if LECN functional connectivity can be shown to consistently differ in OUD subjects compared to HC, it may represent a neurobiological underpinning of impaired executive functioning observed in OUD [ ]. Future studies should examine the association between LECN functional connectivity and addiction-related behaviors and treatment response in OUD. \n\nThe ECN is proposed to play a role in executing goal-directed behavior. Dysfunction in the ECN has been linked to multiple psychopathologies, including substance use disorders [ , ]. Reese et al. (2019) found weaker functional connectivity within the LECN in cocaine use disorder subjects compared to healthy controls [ ]. Two studies found contrasting results in alcohol use disorder – Weiland et al. (2014) found weaker functional connectivity within the LECN in alcohol use disorder subjects relative to healthy controls, while Zhu et al. (2017) found stronger functional connectivity in the LECN in alcohol use disorder subjects relative to healthy controls [ , ]. The opposing findings of Zhu et al. (2017) may be because their reported region within the LECN with increased functional connectivity was in the left posterior parietal cortex, while the region with significantly weaker LECN functional connectivity from our study was in the left dlPFC [ ]. Although both Reese et al. (2019) and Weiland et al. (2014) found weaker functional connectivity in the LECN, they did not report which specific region within the LECN showed decreased functional connectivity [ , ]. \n\nThe dlPFC node within the ECN has been proposed to play a key role in directing and sustaining attention during goal directed behavior and working memory [ , ]. While there is currently no universally accepted interpretation of stronger or weaker resting state fMRI functional connectivity, one suggestion proposed by some of the authors of the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) is that weaker within-network functional connectivity in a given set of voxels or regions may reflect weaker synchrony with the processes of a given network [ ]. While speculative, weaker functional connectivity of the dlPFC within the LECN may be related to impaired recruitment of the dlPFC within the LECN during the initiation of goal directed behavior. This impaired recruitment may relate to the impaired attentional control and impulsivity found in substance use disorders [ ]. Executive control deficits in OUD have been well documented and may be partially improved by drug abstinence and medication therapies [ ]. If ECN functional connectivity is shown to relate to executive control deficits in OUD, it may serve as a target for OUD treatment studies. \n\nImpulsivity is proposed to relate to increased substance use by an increased proclivity to act on the immediate reward associated with substance use without consideration of the long-term consequences of substance use [ ]. NU may be related to increased drug use because of susceptibility to impulsive action in response to the stress of drug withdrawal and craving [ ]. However, the results in the present study do not support a significant association between NU and functional connectivity of the LECN. It is possible that our sample size was too small to detect a subtle association between LECN functional connectivity and NU. Future work should further investigate whether LECN functional connectivity is associated with impulsivity and executive control task performance in larger samples of HC and OUD subjects. \n\nDMN functional connectivity did not differ between groups. The lack of a significant difference in DMN functional connectivity may be related to previous findings suggesting that DMN functional connectivity may be influenced by recent drug use, although recency of last opioid use was unrelated to DMN functional connectivity in our post-hoc analysis [ ]. It is also possible that different sub-systems and sub-regions of the DMN may be differentially affected by chronic drug use [ ]. Our findings also showed that SN and RECN functional connectivity did not differ between OUD and HC, and we were unable to find previous published studies using ICA that compared OUD and HC within these networks. Our results do not support any statistically significant differences in functional connectivity of any of the 4 networks examined between severe OUD and mild or moderate OUD subgroups, although this subgroup analysis was underpowered due to small subgroup sample size. \n\nAll but 2 of the OUD subjects in this study were current users according to their DSM-5 diagnosis, and therefore this study was unable to compare former opioid users with current opioid users. Future studies should include subjects with past OUD to compare the effects of former vs. current OUD on network connectivity. On the other hand, the time since last opioid use was analyzed in the present study and showed no significant effects on functional connectivity in the networks analyzed. We also compared OUD subjects who were UDS positive for buprenorphine or methadone with OUD subjects who were UDS positive for only illicit opioids and found no statistically significant differences between the two subgroups. However, this subgroup analysis was also underpowered because of small subgroup sample size. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nA limitation of our study was the relatively small sample size. Recent research has highlighted the importance of large sample sizes in promoting reliability and reproducibility of resting state fMRI research [ ]. Given our relatively small sample size, our results should be interpreted with caution and treated as preliminary for hypothesis generation. Replication of our results is needed. Another limitation of our study was the heterogeneity of our OUD sample. While our heterogenous OUD sample may be more representative of the OUD population, it is unclear exactly how differences in treatment adherence, recency of drug use, and polysubstance use may influence functional connectivity. Future studies with larger sample sizes should examine the effects of these factors systematically. Additionally, our sample size was underpowered to determine group interactions with sex; further work is needed to analyze the influence of sex on functional connectivity in OUD. Additionally, there was a range of time lag between the date of assessment of OUD severity and the date of the MRI scan that may have led to inaccuracy in estimating the actual OUD severity at the time of the scan. \n\nAnother limitation is that the OUD group had significantly higher mFD, education, and NU than the HC group. However, the mFD difference between groups was only 0.03 mm, and all subjects in both groups met the stringent motion criteria for inclusion in the analysis ( ) [ ]. Furthermore, the effects of head motion on the fMRI signal had been corrected with the CompCor method and the ICAAROMA method, and ICA components with possible motion-related structured noise are regressed out during the dual regression procedure [ – ]. Despite all of these correction procedures and the very small difference in head motion between groups, it is crucial to rule out variations in head motion as driving group differences in functional connectivity, and if there are group differences in head motion, then investigators should perform a check whether motion is correlated with functional connectivity in their study [ ]. In our sample, when conducting this check, there was no statistically significant correlation between mFD and functional connectivity in any of the 4 networks analyzed. Education and NU were also not statistically significantly related to the functional connectivity of any of the 4 networks analyzed. Another limitation is that 16 of the OUD subjects were tobacco users while none of our HC subjects were tobacco users. Tobacco-using OUD subjects did not statistically significantly differ from non-tobacco-using OUD subjects in functional connectivity of any of the 4 networks analyzed, although this analysis was underpowered. Future studies comparing OUD to HC should aim to balance subject groups for years of education attained, NU, and tobacco use. Due to the small sample size, difference in baseline demographic variables between OUD and HC subjects, and heterogeneity in drug use and treatment status in the OUD subjects, our results should be interpreted with caution and treated as preliminary. Furthermore, our results do not provide evidence regarding any specific behavioral correlates of the weaker LECN resting state fMRI functional connectivity in OUD relative to HC. Future studies should examine the addiction-related behavioral associations of LECN functional connectivity differences between OUD and HC. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThese novel preliminary results suggest that ECN functional connectivity may differ between OUD and HC. This finding is consistent with previous research showing altered executive function in OUD and supports further examination of ECN functional connectivity in association with treatment response in OUD. Given our relatively small sample size (50 subjects total; 25 subjects per group), the statistically significant difference in demographic variables between groups, and the heterogeneity within our OUD group, our results should be treated as preliminary for hypothesis generation. Replication of these results will be needed in future studies. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"1e8511df24362c317368bc6d0ff1b10b"},

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), offline consolidation effects have been evidenced probing behavioural and neurophysiological changes during memory retrieval, i.e., in the context of task practice. Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) further allows investigating the offline evolution of recently learned information without the confounds of online task-related effects. We used rsfMRI to investigate sleep-related changes in seed-based resting functional connectivity (FC) and amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) after spatial navigation learning and relearning. On Day 1, offline resting state activity was measured immediately before and after topographical learning in a virtual town. On Day 4, it was measured again before and after relearning in an extended version of the town. Navigation-related activity was also recorded during target retrieval, i.e., online. Participants spent the first post-training night under regular sleep (RS) or sleep deprivation (SD) conditions. Results evidence FC and ALFF changes in task-related neural networks, indicating the continuation of navigation-related activity in the resting state. Although post-training sleep did not modulate behavioural performance, connectivity analyses evidenced increased FC after post-training SD between navigation-related brain structures during relearning in the extended environment. These results suggest that memory traces were less efficiently consolidated after post-learning SD, eventually resulting in the use of compensatory brain resources to link previously stored spatial elements with the newly presented information. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nEvidence ranging from cell recordings in rodents to human behavioural and neuroimaging data show that sleep participates in the long-term consolidation of recently acquired information [ ] in various memory domains [ , ]. Amongst others, sleep supports the consolidation of spatial memory [ , , ], the cognitive system responsible for recording information about one’s environment and spatial orientation. Spatial and episodic declarative memory share similar neuroanatomical foundations in human beings and animals [ ]. This makes spatial memory an attractive paradigm to study the effects of sleep, with unique opportunities for translational inferences. \n\nNon-invasive neuroimaging studies have consistently shown that spatial navigation is subtended by a distributed brain network encompassing the hippocampus, the dorsal striatum, the precuneus and the entorhinal, parahippocampal, retrosplenial and frontal cortices [ , ]. Rodent studies further demonstrated that the hippocampus is involved in the rapid acquisition of spatial information at an early stage of learning, allowing the animal to reach its target from any starting position [ ]. The entorhinal cortex contributes to the encoding of map-like spatial codes, whereas parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices provide significant inputs allowing to anchor these cognitive maps to fixed environmental landmarks. Spatial encoding- and retrieval-related activity in these brain areas is coordinated with frontal lobe activity to plan routes during navigation [ ]. Besides, navigation performance also relies on the dorsal striatum, which supports a complementary learning system based on rewarded stimulus-response automated behavioural associations, such as gradually learning successive body turns in response to environmental cues to reach a known target location from a starting point [ , ]. Human and animal studies investigating the role of hippocampal and striatal areas in place-based vs. response-based navigation strategies suggest that these two systems initially compete with each other during the acquisition phase, and then become more integrated and interdependent after extended training [ , ]. \n\nThe reinstatement of experience-dependent neural activity during sleep is thought to be a critical element of memory consolidation, allowing new, fragile memory traces to stabilize and reorganize over time [ ]. Supporting this hypothesis, rodent studies showed that learning-related neural patterns of hippocampal place cell activity are spontaneously replayed during sleep, in particular during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep [ , ], which does not preclude an important role for REM sleep in memory consolidation (see e.g., [ , ]). Likewise, human studies evidenced the experience-dependent reactivation of neural activity during post-training sleep in brain areas previously activated at learning during wakefulness [ , , , , ]. Regarding spatial memories, positron emission tomography highlighted increased activity during NREM sleep in navigation-related hippocampal and parahippocampal regions in participants trained to explore a virtual city before sleep, as compared to subjects trained to another, non-hippocampus-dependent procedural memory task [ ]. Moreover, overnight gains in navigation performance were correlated with the amplitude of hippocampal activity during NREM sleep. Besides, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetoencephalography investigations showed that post-learning sleep (as compared to the same time spent awake) leads to the reorganization and/or optimization of the brain patterns underlying the delayed retrieval of topographical [ , ], declarative [ ] or motor procedural [ , , , ] memories. In particular, it was found using a spatial navigation task that post-learning sleep leads to a restructuration of the neuronal underpinnings of behaviour [ ]. Navigation in a recently learned environment, initially subtended by hippocampus-based spatial strategies, becomes more contingent on response-based strategies mediated by the striatum a few days later when participants are allowed to sleep on the first night after learning [ , ], suggesting that post-learning sleep contributes to the automation of the navigation behaviour. \n\nWhile providing us with relevant knowledge regarding the brain networks supporting cognitive functioning during a learning session or at delayed retrieval, online task-based functional MRI (fMRI) only indirectly explores the offline consolidation processes subtending the maintenance and optimization of novel information outside of the learning and/or testing environments, as it does not directly measure brain activity during the offline consolidation phase. We previously showed using fMRI that novel topographical learning actually modulates hippocampal responses at wake during a subsequent, unrelated attentional task, suggesting that modulated brain activity during post-training wakefulness contributes to memory consolidation by shaping and reinforcing the functional connections between learning-related cerebral structures and other brain regions [ ]. Another experimental approach to investigate the offline evolution of the cerebral correlates of recently formed memories, without the confounding effect of concurrent task practice, is to document experience-driven changes in intrinsic brain connectivity during the post-training resting state, which can be done using a resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) [ ]. For instance, Woolley et al. [ ] found increased functional connectivity (FC) between hippocampus and caudate nucleus in the resting state after (vs. before) navigation in a virtual water maze, correlated three days later with offline gains in behavioural performance. Likewise, FC increased after 45 min of spatial route learning within a hippocampus-related network [ ]. These data indicate that rsfMRI is a sensitive approach to investigate the offline processes subtending the consolidation of novel memories. \n\nFrom an ecological perspective, topographical learning in unfamiliar environments such as unknown cities may usually span over several days or even weeks, the voyager having the opportunity to visit and revisit different but related spatial units and to integrate the knowledge acquired in previously learned areas with his/her ongoing exploration. In this context, rsfMRI provides a valuable tool to better understand the dynamic processes of integration and consolidation following learning an then relearning, and their relationships with post-training sleep. In the present study, we investigated rsfMRI activity and connectivity changes immediately after spatial navigation learning, at delayed retrieval 4 days later modulated by regular sleep (RS) versus total sleep deprivation (SD) on the first post-learning night, and then after a relearning episode in an extended environment encompassing the initial environment. To do so, we analysed resting-state activity using both seed-based FC (i.e., that estimates the changes in connectivity between predefined seed areas and other brain regions) and amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF; i.e., that estimates spontaneous activity at rest, regardless of the temporal correlation) metrics. Additionally, task (navigation)-based fMRI activity was recorded during test sessions. We hypothesized that sleep-dependent changes in intrinsic FC in the resting state would parallel and/or complement the previously reported reorganization in task-related brain networks supporting navigation, from hippocampal to striatal and frontal areas [ , ]. Furthermore, we expected further FC changes between the hippocampus, striatum and frontal areas after renewed spatial learning in the extended version of the initial environment, reflecting the ongoing integration with previously consolidated knowledge during sleep. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants and Procedure \n  \nIn a first step, 51 healthy volunteers gave their written informed consent to participate in a single experimental session (Day 1) of this study approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Liege, Belgium (B70720156274). All procedures were performed following relevant guidelines and regulations. One participant was excluded due to an abnormal structural MRI scan. The final sample consisted of 50 right-handed (Laterality Quotient Score [ ] > 70) participants (26 males; mean age, 23.5 years; range, 19–32 years). A subset of 34 participants (18 males; mean age, 23.5 years; range, 19–31 years) additionally gave consent to further participate in a SD vs. RS protocol with a second experimental session (Day 4). They were all paid for their participation. Self-reported questionnaires assessed sleep habits (PSQI [ ]) and circadian topology (MEQ [ ]) for the past month before inclusion. Exclusion criteria were extreme circadian chronotype (MEQ score > 69 or < 31) and bad sleep quality (PSQI score > 5), prior history of neurological or psychiatric disorder, or consumption of psychotropic drugs. \n\nThe experimental timeline is illustrated in  . On Day 1, sessions were conducted in the afternoon from 13:00 to 20:00. Participants (  n   = 50) were first scanned during a 5-minute resting state session (rsfMRI 1), then had 45 min outside of the scanner to explore and learn the Level 1 of the virtual city, followed by a behavioural navigation test where they had to reach as fast as possible 10 targets within the learned environment (see below). They were then scanned while performing the navigation test again (i.e., 10 targets to reach) for approximately 8 min, and then scanned again during a second resting state session (rsfMRI 2). A subset of participants was randomly assigned either to the regular sleep (RS;   n   = 16; 9 males) or to the sleep deprivation (SD;   n   = 18; 10 males) condition. Participants in the RS group were allowed normal sleeping at home and were requested to follow regular sleep habits for the 3 experimental nights. In the SD group, participants were kept awake in the laboratory during the first post-learning night. During this SD night, their physical activity was maintained as low as possible under constant supervision by the experimenters. Participants remained most of the time in a seated position, and were allowed to read, chat, play quiet games and watch movies. They received isocaloric meals at regular intervals, and water ad libitum. At 8:00 am, they were allowed to leave the lab, and were instructed to have non-dangerous daytime activities and abstain as much as possible from napping until bedtime. They then slept normally at home the two following nights. Sleep quality and quantity for each night from before the first learning session (Day 1) to the last testing session (Day 4) was assessed using a daily standardized questionnaire [ ] controlled by visual inspection of continuous actimetric recordings (ActiGraph, wGT3X-BT Monitor, USA). On Day 4, SD and RS participants came back to the laboratory for a second experimental session. First, they were scanned in the resting state (rsfMRI 3), then scanned using fMRI while engaged in a Level 1 navigation retrieval test similar to Day 1 (i.e., 10 targets to reach). To control for potential circadian confounds, fMRI scanning took place at the same time of day as the initial testing for each individual. Afterwards, participants were trained outside of the MRI scanner for an additional 40 min on an extended version of the navigation task (Level 1 and 2 of the town, see  ), in which were also incorporated the targets and environments of the initial training. They were then scanned again in the resting state (rsfMRI 4) and finally tested on the extended version of the navigation task outside of the MRI environment. A high-resolution structural MRI scan was also acquired for each participant at the end of the brain imaging session, on either Day 1 or Day 4. \n\n\n### 2.2. Learning Material and Conditions \n  \nParticipants were trained in a virtual navigation environment previously used in related studies [ , , ], adapted from a commercially available computer game (Duke Nukem 3D; 3D Realms Entertainment, Apogee Software, Garland, TX, USA) using the editor provided (Build, Ken Silverman, Realms Entertainment, Apogee Software, Garland, TX, USA). It features a complex town made of two levels communicating through two teleports ( ). Each level is composed of three districts, distinct from each other by a different visual architecture, distinctive objects along the streets, and specific background sounds and music. Each district contains one target location identified by a rotating medallion. Participants navigate the town at ground level using a four-direction keypad with their right hand, at a constant speed of 1.25 virtual units per second.  \n\n#### 2.2.1. Behavioural Sessions \n  \nDuring behavioural sessions outside of the scanner (Learning (Day 1) and Relearning (Day 4) phases), participants were trained for about 45 min on the virtual environment presented on a personal computer laptop (screen size, 17 inches).  \n\nOn Day 1 (Learning), the training consisted of four 8-minute blocks of free exploration within Level 1 of the virtual environment, each block starting from one of the three possible targets. Participants were explicitly instructed to learn the spatial layout of the streets, districts, and target locations by moving freely within the environment. During the entire training session, pictures of the three target locations and their associated names were continuously available. At the end of each 8-minute blocks, participants were exposed to a test trial similar to the one proposed in the fMRI environment, i.e., they were assigned a starting point and instructed to reach a given target location as fast as possible and in a maximal time of 28 s (i.e., the shortest possible duration from starting point to target destination). At the end of the four 8-minute blocks of free exploration, participants were exposed to 10 test trials in a row, to be performed later in the fMRI setting (see below). \n\nAt Day 4 (relearning), participants were trained again for four 8-minute blocks of free exploration within an environment composed of both the initial three districts (Level 1) and an additional level (Level 2) made of three new districts. They were informed that both levels were connected by two teleports positioned at opposite locations and instructed to learn the layout of Level 2 as well as the locations of each teleport, in order to be able to reach the initial targets located on Level 1, starting from random locations in Level 2. Each block started at one of the two teleports. At the end of each 8-minute training block, participants performed a test trial, i.e., they were assigned a starting point in Level 2 and asked to reach, as fast as possible, one of the initial targets in Level 1 within a 60-second window (i.e., the shortest possible duration from Level 2 starting point to Level 1 target destination). After training and the last resting state (rsfMRI 4) sessions, participants were administered a final test of ten 60-second trials outside of the MRI environment.  \n\n\n#### 2.2.2. Task-Based fMRI \n  \nDuring task-based fMRI (Immediate retrieval fMRI Test 1 and Delayed retrieval fMRI Test 2;  ), volunteers performed a series of navigation tests in the virtual town. For each test, they were assigned a starting point and instructed to reach, as fast as possible, a given target location in Level 1 within the time limit of 28 s. Because the duration of the shortest path between the starting point and the target is 28 s at constant speed, reaching the destination could only be achieved if participants selected the ideal path and did not stop at all during the navigation. The fMRI test session consisted of 10 test blocks, each lasting for 28 s and alternating with a pause menu displayed for a variable duration ranging 10–17 s. For both Day 1 and Day 4 behavioural and fMRI testing sessions, participants’ navigation paths were analysed a posteriori based on video screen recordings, and a quantitative measure of performance was computed at each block as the shortest distance remaining between the subject’s actual location at the end of the time limit for the test trial and the location of the target destination [ , , ]. \n\n\n#### 2.2.3. Resting State RS-fMRI \n  \nDuring rsfMRI sessions 1, 2, 3 and 4, participants were instructed to relax, keep their eyes open and fixate for 5 min a white cross displayed on a black background on the MRI’s screen.  \n\n\n\n### 2.3. Brain Imaging Data Acquisition \n  \nBrain MRI data were acquired on a whole-body 3T scanner (Magnetom Prisma, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). For both task-based and resting-state fMRI, multi-slice T2*-weighted functional images were acquired with a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence using axial slice orientation and covering the whole brain (36 slices, FoV = 216 × 216 mm , voxel size 3 × 3 × 3 mm , 25% interslice gap, matrix size = 72 × 72 × 36, repetition time (TR) = 2260 ms, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle (FA) = 90 deg).  \n\nFor task-based fMRI Retrieval Test 1 and Test 2 sessions, 210 functional images were recorded. The virtual environment was displayed on a screen positioned at the rear of the scanner that the subject could comfortably see through a mirror mounted on the head coil. Participants navigated using 4 directional buttons on a commercially available MRI compatible keypad system (fORP; Current Design, Vancouver). For each resting state session (rsfMRI 1-4), 132 functional images were obtained.  \n\nFor anatomical reference, a high-resolution T1-weighted structural image was acquired for each subject (T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence, TR = 1900 ms, TE = 2.19 ms, FA = 9 deg, inversion time (TI) = 900 ms, FoV = 256 × 240 mm , matrix size = 256 × 240 × 224, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm , acceleration factor in phase-encoding direction R = 2). \n\n\n### 2.4. Task-Based fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nThe pre-processing and analysis of functional volumes were performed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping software SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) implemented in MATLAB R2012B (Mathworks, Sherbom, MA, USA). The five initial volumes of each time series were discarded to avoid T1 saturation effects. Pre-processing of individual data included realignment (2-step realignment on the first volume of the series), correction for geometric distortions caused by magnetic fields based on the Field Map Toolbox [ ], co-registration of functional and anatomical data, spatial normalization into standard stereotactic Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). Excessive head movements of more than 4 mm of translation or 4 degrees of rotation in any direction were considered exclusion criteria. No participant exhibited excessive head motion.  \n\nFunctional data were analysed using a mixed-effects model aimed at showing stereotypical effect in the population from which the subjects are drawn [ ]. For each subject, a first-level intra-individual analysis tested effects of interest by linear contrasts convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function, generating statistical parametric maps. Movement parameters derived from the realignment phase were included as confounding factors. Cut-off period for high-pass filtering was 128 s due to the block design alternating 28-second navigation blocks with 10–17 s breaks. Additionally, navigation performance was added to the model to test possible relationships between neuronal activity in navigation-related areas and behavioural performance. Navigation-related regional BOLD response modulated by navigation performance was computed at the within-subject level. Since no inference was made at this fixed effect level of analysis, individual summary statistic images were computed at a   p   < 0.95 threshold uncorrected, and then further spatially smoothed (6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel). Individual summary statistics images were then entered in a second-level analysis, corresponding to a random effects (RFX) model, to evaluate commonalities and differences in brain response between the RS and SD groups, and between immediate and delayed Retrieval Test sessions. The resulting set of voxel values for each contrast constituted a map of the   t   statistic (SPM(T)). Statistical inferences were obtained after correction for multiple comparisons at the voxel level (Family Wise Error (FWE) correction   p   < 0.05) in the whole brain, or after small volume correction (SVC) in five regions of interests (ROIs) selected based on published reports showing their involvement in topographical/spatial learning [ , , , , ], i.e., bilaterally the hippocampus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the retrosplenial and medial parietal cortices (Brodmann areas 29, 30 and 31), the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) and the entorhinal cortex. Positions and dimensions of ROI were obtained using the Automated Anatomical Labelling (AAL) atlas [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.5. Resting State Data Analysis \n  \n#### 2.5.1. Preprocessing  \n  \nPreprocessing of rsfMRI data was carried out using the SPM12 software and the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) [ ]. The first 10 volumes of each time series were discarded to avoid T1 saturation effects. Functional images were realigned to the first volume to correct for head motion. Participants with a translation superior to 2.0 mm in any direction, or an angular motion superior to 2.0 along any axis were excluded from the analysis. Following this criterion, one participant was excluded. The final samples for rsfMRI analyses therefore consisted of 49 participants for day 1, and 34 participants for day 4. Subsequently, each individual structural image (T1-weighted MPRAGE image) was co-registered to the mean functional image after motion correction using a linear transformation. The transformed structural images were then segmented into grey matter (GM), white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid using Diffeormorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL). To further reduce potential confounds of head motion, a Friston-24 correction [ ] was applied based on six rigid body head motion parameters. Signals from cerebrospinal fluid and white matter were also entered as confound covariates to reduce the possible effects of physiological artifacts. The corrected functional volumes were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and re-sampled to 3 mm isotropic voxels using DARTEL. Resultant normalized functional images were de-trended and spatially smoothed with an 8 mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.  \n\n\n#### 2.5.2. ALFF Analysis \n  \nSmoothed images were band-pass filtered (0.1–0.01 Hz) to reduce low-frequency drifts and high-frequency noise before the Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) analysis aimed at investigating local changes in resting state activity. ALFF individual maps were computed with DPARSF [ ] and entered into second-level analyses to examine increases in ALFF signal associated with a spatial learning episode on Day 1 and Day 4, and to investigate if functional changes associated with learning in the extended version of the environment differed between SD and RS groups on Day 4. ALFF changes associated with performance were also investigated by entering behavioural performance as a covariate of interest at the second level (RFX) of the analysis. Statistical inferences were computed at the whole brain level based on a two-tailed permutation test with 5000 permutations and a threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) correction within a grey matter mask (obtained by thresholding an a priori grey matter probability map in SPM12; threshold = 0.25). Results were considered significant at   p   < 0.05 after a false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons. Region of interest analyses were also conducted within the five a priori ROIs defined above based on the literature [ , , , , ]. Clusters in which activations were found to correlate with performance in the task-based fMRI analysis on Day 1 and/or Day 4 were also examined as regions of interests for Day 1 (3 clusters) and Day 4 (0 clusters) ALFF analyses. \n\n\n#### 2.5.3. Seed-Based Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nFC was analysed with seed-voxel correlation mapping using the CONN-fMRI toolbox 13.i for SPM [ ]. Preprocessed data (see above) were temporally filtered using a band-pass filter to retain frequencies from 0.008 to 0.09 Hz. Noise signals such as cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, movement parameters and time-series predictors of global signal were further removed from the images using the component-based noise correction method (CompCor) [ ]. Averaged signals were extracted from 10 different seeds defined using the Automated Anatomical Labelling (AAL) atlas: left and right hippocampus, parahippocampus, dorsal striatum, retrosplenial-medio parietal cortex and entorhinal cortex (regions of interest taken from [ , , , , ]). Clusters found to correlate with performance in the task-based fMRI and ALFF analyses on Day 1 and Day 4 were also used as seeds for Day 1 and Day 4 analyses respectively, yielding 7 extra seeds for Day 1 and 2 extra seeds for Day 4. Temporal correlations of resting-state BOLD signal time series between these seeds and the rest of the brain were examined using a General Linear Model approach. Individual connectivity maps were computed for each seed and entered into a second level analysis to examine changes in connectivity following navigation learning on Day 1, and to investigate if functional changes associated with learning in the extended version of the environment differed between RS and SD groups on Day 4. Behavioural performance following learning was used as a covariate of interest (or as a weighting factor of BOLD signal). Statistical inference for each seed and contrast were first based on a family-wise error correction (  p   < 0.005) at the cluster-level with an uncorrected threshold of   p   < 0.001 at the voxel level. A Bonferroni correction was then applied based on the number of seeds for Day 1 (  n   = 17) and Day 4 (  n   = 12) analyses separately. Results were thus considered significant at a threshold of   p   = 0.0014 (.05/17) for Day 1 analyses and   p   = 0.002 (.05/12) for Day 4 analyses.  \n\n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Behavioural Results \n  \n#### 3.1.1. Sleep Data  \n  \nSleep duration and quality were estimated by means of self-reports of the nights preceding Day 1 and Day 4. Mean sleep duration was not significantly different between RS and SD groups on the night before Day 1 (RS = 437 ± 60 min, TSD = 457 ± 46 min;   p   > 0.2) and the night before Day 4 (RS = 436 ± 55 min, TSD = 459 ± 48 min;   p   > 0.2). Within each group, duration of each night did not differ significantly (RS group:   p   > 0.8; TSD group:   p   > 0.7). Likewise, a similar analysis conducted on subjective sleep quality assessed by means of a 6-point scale failed to evidence between-group differences. Subjective sleep quality was equivalent between groups for each night (night before Day 1: RS = 3.7 ± 1.2, TSD = 3.4 ± 1.1;   p   > 0.5; night before Day 4: RS = 3.7 ± 0.7, TSD = 3.7 ± 0.9;   p   > 0.9). Finally, within-group comparisons did not reveal any significant difference in sleep quality between both nights (RS group:   p   > 0.9; TSD group:   p   > 0.1). These results indicate that sleep patterns observed the night before the SD episode were restored before being scanned again in the delayed session, and therefore that all participants were tested under similar states of alertness on Days 1 and 4. \n\n\n#### 3.1.2. Navigation Performance \n  \nAs a reminder, for each of the 10 place finding tests administered during fMRI sessions at Day 1 (Immediate retrieval) and Day 4 (Delayed retrieval), participants were instructed to reach, as fast as possible, a given Level 1 target from one designated starting point within 28 s. Distance remaining to reach destination was the estimate of navigation performance [ , , ] (see Methods). Mean distance scores per session for the SD group were 17.17 (arbitrary units, standard deviation (sd 8.29)) and 17.53 (sd 11.1) at immediate (Day 1) and delayed retrieval (Day 4), respectively. Distances scores for the RS group were 15.12 (sd 13.15) at immediate and 15.47 (sd 12.2) at delayed retrieval, respectively. A two-way ANOVA computed on within-session individual mean scores with group (SD vs. RS) and retrieval session (Immediate vs. Delayed) factors did not reveal any significant main or interaction effect (all   ps   > 0.1). Likewise, at testing after the second learning session on the extended version of the town, mean performance did not statistically differ (  t   = −0.2;   p   = 0.8) between the RS (arbitrary units, 15.8, sd 19.10) and SD (17.3, sd 19.7) conditions.  \n\nThese results suggest that (1) both groups gained knowledge of the virtual town that persisted 3 days after learning, that (2) SD on the first post-training night did not overtly alter subjects’ ability to find their way in the town at delayed retrieval (which does not preclude the use of qualitatively different strategies for a similar performance), and that (3) learning novel routes and integration with prior knowledge in the extended version of the town was similar in the RS and SD conditions. \n\n\n\n### 3.2. Task-Based fMRI \n  \n#### 3.2.1. Navigation-Related Brain Activity  \n  \nA conjunction analysis disclosed increased blood–oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses in an extended hippocampo-neocortical network during place finding, both at immediate (Day 1) and delayed (Day 4) navigation retrieval sessions. At immediate retrieval, navigation-related activity was found mostly in the right hippocampus/parahippocampus (32 −40–4 mm in MNI standard stereotactic space, Z score = 4.55, number of voxels in cluster k = 30; p  < 0.05) and surrounding structures as well as in occipital, parietal, frontal and cerebellar areas ( ). At delayed retrieval, increased BOLD activity was highlighted in a similar set of brain structures, except for the right hippocampus, in which activation did not survive correction for multiple comparisons ( ). Correlation analyses disclosed a positive relationship between individual performance scores (i.e., reversed navigation score based on the distance toward destination, higher scores meaning better performance) and navigation-related responses in the left (−22 2–10 mm, Z = 4.14, k = 74, p  < 0.03) putamen at immediate retrieval. At delayed retrieval, no significant correlation was found between performance and navigation-related activity, either at the whole brain level or within ROIs.  \n\n\n#### 3.2.2. Post-Training Sleep-Dependent Reorganization of Navigation-Related Brain Activity \n  \nA group (SD vs. RS) by session (Day 1 vs. Day 4) ANOVA conducted on navigation-related brain activity did not disclose any main or interaction effect, either at the whole brain level or within ROIs. A similar analysis conducted on navigation-related regional BOLD responses modulated by navigation performance also did not yield significant results. \n\n\n\n### 3.3. Resting State ALFF \n  \n#### 3.3.1. Spatial Learning-Related Changes in Spontaneous Activity at Rest \n  \nOn Day 1, local ALFF increased following learning (rsfMRI 2 vs. rsfMRI 1) in a parietal medial cluster encompassing parts of the precuneus and of the posterior cingulate gyrus (peak x y z coordinate 6 –45 21 mm, intensity = 479.36, cluster extent k = 268) and an extended cluster encompassing frontal and parietal regions (6 −30 60 mm, intensity = 513.80, k = 409; all   ps   < 0.05). On Day 4, local ALFF increased following learning (rsfMRI 4 vs. rsfMRI 3) in a parietal cluster (maximal peak −3 –57 15 mm, intensity = 788.80, k = 4072), a cerebellar cluster (−36 −60 −42 mm, intensity = 528.01, k = 130) and two clusters located in the left rectal gyrus (0 24 –21 mm, intensity = 623.98, k = 271) and the right lingual gyrus (15 −99 −12 mm, intensity = 593.63, k = 463; all   ps   < 0.05). \n\nOn Day 1, there was a correlation between navigation retrieval performance (Test 1) and increased ALFF in the right and left posterior cingulate (3 –51 27 mm, intensity 399.51, k = 74; −3 −54 27 mm, intensity = 104.69, k = 57) and right parahippocampal gyrus (33 −18 −30 mm, intensity 50.38, k = 24; all   ps   < 0.05) clusters. On Day 4, navigation performance correlated with local ALFF in left parahippocampal gyrus (−15 −6 −15 mm, intensity = 72.10, k = 24; −24 −6 −33 mm, intensity = 95.99, k = 61; all   ps   < 0.05) clusters.  \n\n\n#### 3.3.2. Post-Training Sleep-Dependent Learning-Related Changes in Spontaneous Activity at Rest \n  \nBetween-group comparison revealed no significant differences in ALFF changes associated with learning on either Day 1 or Day 4 when comparing RS and SD groups.  \n\n\n\n### 3.4. Resting State FC \n  \n#### 3.4.1. Spatial Learning-Related Changes in Seed-Based FC  \n  \nAs a reminder, seeds for connectivity analyses were defined based on a priori ROIs (10 seeds) and on clusters found to correlate with performance in the task-based fMRI or ALFF analyses (see Methods section) for a total of 16 seeds for Day 1 and 12 seeds for Day 4. All analyses are Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. On Day 1 (corrected significance threshold   p   < 0.05/16 = 0.0031), increased FC (from pre-learning (rsfMRI 1) to post-learning (rsfMRI 2) resting state sessions) was found between the left hippocampus and the right middle frontal gyrus (32 4 56 mm, k = 247, T = 4.95, cluster p  = 0.0023), between the right entorhinal cortex and three clusters located in the right temporal (52 −18 −24 mm, k = 351, T = 5.46, cluster p  = 0.000001) and left temporal (−58 −16 −24 mm, k = 401, T = 5.02, cluster p  = 0.000066) cortices, and in the right posterior cingulum (10 −42 28 mm, k = 605, T = 4.18, cluster p  = 0.000197), as well as between the left entorhinal cortex and a cluster located in the cerebellum (−30 −40 −34 mm, k = 310, T = 4.88, cluster p  = 0.000497). Based on seeds taken from task-based correlation analyses between navigation-related activity and performance, spatial learning on Day 1 was associated with increased FC between the left parahippocampal gyrus and the right precuneus (6 −60 44 mm, k = 330, T = 5.09, cluster p  = 0.000211), the right precuneus and the right middle frontal gyrus (30 4 38 mm, k = 324, T = 4.26, cluster p  = 0.000343) and the left posterior cingulate cortex and the right supramarginal gyrus (58 −34 48 mm, k = 232, T = 4.57, cluster p  = 0.000377; see   for detailed results). No FC change correlated with performance.  \n\nOn Day 4 (corrected significance threshold   p   < 0.05/12 = 0.0041), learning in the extended version of the task triggered increased FC (from the pre-learning (rsfMRI 3) to the post-learning (rsfMRI 4) resting state session) between the left hippocampus and the right postcentral gyrus (36 −30 70 mm, k = 249, T = 4.34, cluster p  = 0.002026). FC change did not correlate with performance.  \n\n\n#### 3.4.2. Sleep-Dependent Changes in Seed-Based Resting State FC  \n  \nAt Day 4 during the first resting state session (rsfMRI 3) before extended learning in the maze, RS participants exhibited higher FC than SD participants between the right dorsal striatum and the left middle frontal gyrus (−34 30 42 mm, k = 272, T = 4.71, cluster p  = 0.001851) ( ). As a proof of concept, we ran similar between-group (RS vs. SD) comparisons on pre- (rsfMRI 1) and post- (rsfMRI 2) learning resting state sessions on Day 1 to ensure that sleep-related differences observed in rsfMRI 3 at Day 4 cannot be explained by initial between-group differences. No significant FC differences between RS and SD conditions were found for any of the 16 seeds considered for the FC analysis on Day 1. Similarly, no significant between-group differences were found when considering learning-dependent changes in FC (rsfMRI 2 > rsfMRI 1). Altogether, it suggests that between-group differences observed at the Day 4 rsfMRI 3 session are attributable to the sleep manipulation on the first post-training night. \n\n\n#### 3.4.3. Post-Training Sleep-Dependent Relearning-Related Changes in Seed-Based Resting State FC  \n  \nA Group (RS vs. SD) by resting state Session (pre-extended learning (rsfMRI 3) vs. post-extended learning (rsfMRI 4)) interaction analysis investigated sleep-dependent changes in resting state FC after learning on the extended version of the town at Day 4. This analysis disclosed increased FC from pre- to post-learning in the SD as compared to the RS condition, between the left retrosplenial cortex and the left superior frontal gyrus (−16 12 48 mm, k = 738, T = 5.91, cluster p  < 0.000001), between the left retrosplenial cortex and the right middle frontal gyrus (28 6 56 mm, k = 390, T = 5.78, cluster p  = 0.000047), and between the right entorhinal cortex and the right superior frontal gyrus (18 24 56 mm, k = 228, T = 5.25, cluster p  = 0.001829;  ). A post-hoc analysis investigating the directionality of the interaction effects highlighted significantly decreased FC in the RS condition vs. increased FC in the SD condition between the left retrosplenial cortex and the left superior frontal gyrus (RS, β  = 0.28  β  = 0.05, T = 4.44,   p   < 0.001; SD, β  = 0.12  β  = 0.26, T = 3.13,   p   < 0.001), the left retrosplenial cortex and the right middle frontal gyrus (RS, β  = 0.13  β  = −0.07,T = 4.38,   p   < 0.001; SD, β  = −0.08  β  0.01, T = 2.94,   p   = 0.004) and the right entorhinal cortex and the right frontal superior gyrus (RS, β  = 0.07  β  = −0.09, T = 5.19,   p   < 0.001; SD, β  = −0.15  β  = −0.02, T = 2.80,   p   = 0.006) ( ). \n\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, resting-state fMRI was used to investigate the offline changes in brain functional connectivity (seed-based FC) and intrinsic regional activity (ALFF) potentially associated with learning and relearning following sleep in a spatial navigation task. \n\nIn line with previous studies, behavioural performance was similar between groups sleep deprived (SD) or sleep rested (RS) after learning, not only at immediate but also at delayed retrieval [ , ], or when tested after learning the extended version of the town. It suggests that one night of SD following training is insufficient to induce observable changes at the behavioural level (see [ , ]), which does not exclude the development of distinct neural strategies subtending successful navigation [ , , ]. Indeed, prior studies found a shift between neural structures subtending quantitatively equivalent retrieval performance after sleep on the post-training night, from hippocampus to striatum in the virtual navigation task after a few days [ , ], and from hippocampus to neocortical frontal regions in other declarative memory tasks after a sleep episode in children [ ] and after weeks to months in adults [ ]. Noticeably, we avoided testing participants at the outcome of the SD experimental night as the stress of the SD experience (and fatigue) would have impacted both performance and brain activity in a way that would actually mask offline sleep-dependent memory consolidation effects. Allowing two regular sleep nights to all participants after the experimental night ensured that the observed differences in brain activity were not attributable to being in an SD state at the time of scanning. Moreover, although it cannot be excluded that some participants took a daytime nap after the SD night, this does do not undermine our findings because we investigated here the effect of the first post-training night of nocturnal sleep, and naps in this case represent a much-delayed period of sleep (just as were the 2 recovery nights), which was, moreover, obtained at a suboptimal circadian phase, as previously discussed [ ]. \n\nLearning to navigate in the virtual environment on Day 1 was associated with increased FC between the left hippocampus and the right middle frontal gyrus, as well as in a network comprising the right entorhinal cortex, bilateral temporal regions and the right posterior cingulum cortex. The right middle frontal gyrus is active during virtual maze exploration [ ], and is important for episodic memory retrieval [ ], while the cingulum contributes to the sense of self-location [ ] and the entorhinal cortex plays a key role for the encoding of map-like spatial codes [ ]. Consequently, increased FC may subtend the integration of egocentric and allocentric spatial representations. When considering as seeds the clusters obtained from task-related fMRI and ALFF analyses, increased FC was found between the left parahippocampal gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus, a set of regions centrally related to spatial memory [ , , ]. On Day 4, learning the extended version of the town triggered an increase in FC between the left hippocampus and the right postcentral gyrus, two regions subtending spatial navigation in recently learned environments [ ]. Noticeably, recent reports propose that, besides being a somatosensory area, the postcentral gyrus plays a role as a high-order navigational system. In rats, spatial cells in this system elicit similar firing characteristics than the ones in the hippocampus [ ]. To the best of our knowledge, this finding has not yet been replicated in humans. Notwithstanding, task-dependent increased FC between the hippocampus and somatosensory areas may be seen as evidence supporting the hypothesis of a cooperation between these two navigational systems.  \n\nSleep deprivation effects on resting-state activity were tested as soon as participants arrived at the laboratory (Day 4), before any kind of learning-related stimulus was presented. Interestingly, we found higher FC in RS than SD participants between the right dorsal striatum and the left middle frontal gyrus. Although supporting behavioural evidence is lacking, it indicates a sleep-dependent reorganization of brain functioning in areas recruited during learning and navigation. \n\nLearning to navigate in an extended version of the initial environment was associated with increased FC between navigation-related brain structures (left retrosplenial and right entorhinal cortices) and frontal regions (left and right superior frontal and right middle frontal gyri) in participants deprived of sleep the night after initial learning (SD) as compared to those having slept normally (RS). The entorhinal and the frontal cortices are respectively thought to support landmark recognition and strategy planning [ ] in the context of spatial navigation, while the retrosplenial cortex plays a central role in spatial strategy switching [ , ]. Stronger functional connections with frontal regions in SD participants might reflect the compensatory brain activity needed to develop different but quantitatively equivalent (eventually leading to similar behavioural performance) spatial representation strategies in the context of extended learning in a less strongly consolidated environment. This tentative interpretation should be tested in further studies.  \n\nWe also investigated changes in the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) as potential markers of learning and memory consolidation processes [ , ]. Both on Day 1 and Day 4, pre- to post-(re)learning changes in local brain activity (ALFF) at rest partially overlapped with clusters found active when performing on the navigation task, suggesting the offline continuation of task-related activity during post-training wakefulness [ ]. Amongst the regions found active in both online (task) and offline (resting state) post-training conditions in the present study, the precuneus was previously involved in self-related mental representations both during rest and spatial information processing [ ]. Post-training activations in the precuneus may thus support the creation of the egocentric spatial map needed for successful topographical navigation. Increased spontaneous activity (ALFF) after learning was also detected on Day 1 in the posterior cingulum, a region that plays an important role in visual-spatial memory due to its connections with hippocampal and parahippocampal regions [ ]. At Day 4, ALFF increased in the right lingual gyrus, a part of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) that responds preferentially to complex visual scenes such as landscapes or cityscapes [ ]. However, the lack of specific literature relating ALFF with memory consolidation processes calls for caution in the interpretation; it might be premature at this stage to link ALFF changes to the replay of memory traces. Both on Day 1 and Day 4, increased resting state activity in the medial temporal lobe positively correlated with behavioural navigation performance, suggesting that prior learning modulates activity in this brain region that to some extent reflects successful learning. In line with behavioural and task-fMRI results, the group (SD vs. RS) by session interaction on spontaneous resting state activity was non-significant, suggesting that ALFF measurements mostly reflected immediate post-training memory processes in waking, but were not modulated by SD after the first post-training night. \n\nAt both immediate and delayed retrieval, task-based fMRI analyses evidenced navigation-related brain activity in a large network including frontal and occipital areas, similar to the ones previously found to support navigation in this task [ , ]. In the current study, however, at variance with previous studies from our group reporting significant correlations between performance and medial temporal activity [ , ] at immediate retrieval, performance at Day 1 already correlated with striatal activation. Consequently, we could not replicate the observation of a shift from hippocampal to a caudate-dependent spatial strategy in the RS as compared to the SD group [ , ], striatal activation being already present at Day 1. We propose here three possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, it should be taken into account that participants spent approximately 20 min lying in the MRI scanner prior to the training session, which might have augmented stress levels and sleepiness. In animals, these elements have been proposed to lead to an increased use of the striatal spatial memory system [ ]. Second, at variance with our prior study [ ], the behavioural training proposed to participants on Day 1 included at the end a repetition of the 10 tests administered during the subsequent task-based fMRI session. This final test was added to reinforce the memory traces and habituate our participants to the conditions in which they would have to perform next in the scanner. However, as participants experienced already once navigating in these conditions, this may have eventually resulted (and much faster than we expected) in a form of automation of the navigation, with a shift toward a striatum-based strategy. Third, the results obtained in our prior study [ ] now date back more than 12 years. Since that time, the use of geolocation software to navigate in the real world has become a given for the new generations, and especially for young adult volunteers. Thus, it cannot be excluded that the spontaneous neuronal underpinnings of spatial navigation performance have evolved in unexpected ways due to the quasi-constant availability of external navigation systems that to some extent replace the need to create topographical representations, a hypothesis that needs experimental confirmation. Finally, the study protocol (as the previous ones [ , ]) does not include a control condition in which participants would have trained on an exploration experience not implicating learning, which would have given us a more specific aspects of learning dynamics. Similarly, the results regarding the interaction between post-learning sleep deprivation and the extension of a previously studied virtual environment would require further confirmation in a larger cohort by using a control condition in which half of the participants of each group (RS and SD) are trained on a completely unrelated environment on Day 4. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nAltogether, our results highlight the continuation of navigation-related activity in the subsequent resting state, as evidenced by changes in functional connectivity and the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations in task-related neural networks. Furthermore, sleep deprivation on the post-training night was associated with increased FC between navigation-related brain structures when faced to the task to learn a novel but related environment (i.e., an extended version of the town), suggesting that SD triggered the need to recruit more resources to link novel information with possibly less efficiently consolidated (after SD) existing memory traces.  \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"6847d4384995152a14a2dd6a2c82cf59"},

However, it is unknown whether neuropathic behaviors are related to dysfunction of the hippocampal circuitry. Here, we enhanced hippocampal activity by pharmacological, optogenetic, and chemogenetic techniques to determine hippocampal influence on neuropathic pain behaviors. We found that excitation of the dorsal (DH), but not the ventral (VH) hippocampus induces analgesia in 2 rodent models of neuropathic pain (SNI and SNL) and in rats and mice. Optogenetic and pharmacological manipulations of DH neurons demonstrated that DH-induced analgesia was mediated by N-Methyl-D-aspartate and μ-opioid receptors. In addition to analgesia, optogenetic stimulation of the DH in SNI mice also resulted in enhanced real-time conditioned place preference for the chamber where the DH was activated, a finding consistent with pain relief. Similar manipulations in the VH were ineffective. Using chemo-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where awake resting-state fMRI was combined with viral vector-mediated chemogenetic activation (PSAM/PSEM ) of DH neurons, we demonstrated changes of functional connectivity between the DH and thalamus and somatosensory regions that tracked the extent of relief from tactile allodynia. Moreover, we examined hippocampal functional connectivity in humans and observe differential reorganization of its anterior and posterior subdivisions between subacute and chronic back pain. Altogether, these results imply that downregulation of the DH circuitry during chronic neuropathic pain aggravates pain-related behaviors. Conversely, activation of the DH reverses pain-related behaviors through local excitatory and opioidergic mechanisms affecting DH functional connectivity. Thus, this study exhibits a novel causal role for the DH but not the VH in controlling neuropathic pain–related behaviors. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nBesides the well-known roles in memory storage and spatial navigation,  the hippocampus also plays central roles in emotional processes, stress responses,  fear context attribution,  and autonomic regulation.  Accumulating evidence, over the past 2 decades, continues to demonstrate differential organization of the hippocampus along its long axis (septotemporally or dorsoventrally in rodents and posteroanteriorly in primates) regarding extrinsic and intrinsic physiological properties, anatomical inputs and outputs, as well as genetic and functional differences.  A prevailing viewpoint is that the dorsal (DH) (or posterior, PH) hippocampus is better implicated in episodic memory and spatial navigation,  and the ventral (VH) (or anterior, AH) hippocampus is a critical component of the anxiety network  (although components of anxiety are also captured within the DH/PH ). Consistent with this viewpoint is evidence of a differential increase of neurosteroid precursors in the VH (relative to the DH) and the anxiolytic effects of hippocampal neurosteroids in neuropathic pain.  Involvement of the DH in acute and chronic pain phenotypes is also supported: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs microinjection into the DH induces antinociception  and also by microinjection of carbachol, morphine, and bicuculline into the DH, whereas muscimol injections enhance nociception.  In keeping with these findings, multiple hippocampal dysfunctions have been identified in rodent models of neuropathic pain, including impaired synaptic plasticity, decreased expression of N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtypes, neurogenesis, instability of place cells, and reorganization of resting-state connectivity.  Moreover, adult hippocampal neurogenesis appears a critical mechanism controlling the transition to chronic pain,  and hippocampal expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β increases in neuropathic rats, and its expression level is positively correlated with tactile allodynia (pain-like behavior).  These findings are complemented by observations in human pain patients, where low hippocampal volumes seem a feature of multiple chronic pain conditions  and the hippocampal volume itself appears to be a predictive factor for transitioning from subacute to chronic back pain.  Thus, hippocampal physiology and connectivity undergo large adaptations with the establishment of chronic pain. Yet, how these changes influence on the ability of the hippocampal circuitry to control pain behavior remains unclear, and whether the DH and VH are differentially involved in pain phenotypes remains unexplored. \n\nWe hypothesized that hippocampal adaptations with the transition to chronic pain, specifically after a peripheral neuropathic injury, would enhance the involvement of the hippocampal circuitry in pain behaviors. We test this hypothesis by studying the modulation of exaggerated tactile responses in mouse and rat models of neuropathic pain, after local activation of DH or VH neurons, with microinjection of glutamate, by optogenetic excitation using channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), or by enhancing depolarizing currents chemogenetically (PSAM/PSEM ). We use wireless optogenetics to assess sensory and affective/motivational aspects of neuropathic pain (optodriven real-time conditioned place preference [opto-rtCPP]); and in rats, we combine chemogenetic manipulations with awake resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (chemo-fMRI)  to identify the impact of hippocampal connectivity in the modulation of neuropathic pain behaviors. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Animals \n  \nFor these experiments, we used Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 to 250 g and adult male C57BL/6 mice weighing 25 to 31 g. The animals were group-housed and had free access to standard chow and water. Some of the described experiments were performed in Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, whereas others were performed in Northwestern University, Chicago. At both locations, the animals were kept at 21 ± 2°C temperature and 30% to 60% humidity, under a 12/12-hour light/dark cycle. Handling and testing were performed during the light period. To minimize stress, they were handled regularly before surgery and behavioral testing. All studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Northwestern University or by the Local Animal Care Committee (Sun Yat-sen University) and followed the ethical guidelines for the investigation of experimental pain in conscious animals. \n\n\n### 2.2. Neuropathic pain models \n  \n#### 2.2.1. Spared nerve injury \n  \nSpared nerve injury (SNI) was performed following the original description.  Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5%-2.5%) in a mixture of 30% N O and 70% O . The sciatic nerve of the left leg was exposed at the trifurcation of peroneal, tibial, and sural branches. The common peroneal and tibial nerves were ligated and cut, whereas the sural nerve was left intact. For the animals in the sham group, the sciatic nerve was only exposed but not disturbed. \n\n\n#### 2.2.2. Spinal nerve ligation \n  \nLumbar segment 5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) was performed following the original description.  Briefly, after rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5%-2.5%), the L5 transverse process was removed to expose the left L5 spinal nerve. L5 spinal nerve was then isolated carefully and ligated tightly with 6-0 silk thread, 5 to 10 mm distal to the L5 dorsal root ganglion. \n\n\n\n### 2.3. Drug administration through brain microinjection \n  \n-Glutamate acid and monosodium salt monohydrate,  (−)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5), were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Indiplon was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). For the brain microinjections, rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.]), and permanent guide cannulae (23 gauge) were implanted in the DH or VH, ipsilateral to the peripheral injury. The stereotaxic coordinates were: AP −3.5 mm, ML −2.0 mm, and DV −3.2 mm (DH); and AP −4.8 mm, ML 4.6 mm, and DV −8.1 mm (VH).  Cannulae were secured with dental cement and anchored to stainless-steel screws fixed to the skull. To prevent clogging and infection, a stainless-steel obturator was inserted into the guide cannula. The rats were allowed to recover for 6 days after surgery. Drug infusions (in a volume of 1 µL) were performed into the DH or VH, ipsilateral to the peripheral injury using a Hamilton syringe connected to a 30-gauge injector at a speed of 1 µL over 1 minute, while the rats were lightly restrained. The injection needle was kept in place for 1 minute to allow the drug to completely diffuse from the tip, and then, the obturator was reinserted into the guide cannula. AP5 (in a volume of 1 µL) was injected through the cannula placed in the DH 30 minutes before glutamate injection. All injection sites were verified post hoc. \n\n\n### 2.4. Assessment of mechanical allodynia \n  \nMechanical response thresholds of the animals were assessed before and after neuropathic injury with the up-down method.  Briefly, animals were placed in a Plexiglass box with a wire grid floor and allowed to habituate to the environment (10-15 minutes for rats and 40-55 minutes for mice). Von Frey (VF) filaments of varying forces (Stoelting Co Wood Dale, IL. USA) were applied to the lateral plantar surface of the hind paw. Filaments were applied in either ascending or descending strengths to determine the filament strength closest to the hind paw withdrawal threshold. Each filament was applied for a maximum of 2 seconds at each trial; paw withdrawal during the stimulation was considered a positive response. Given the response pattern and the force of the final filament, 50% paw withdrawal threshold was calculated following the method described by Chaplan et al. \n\n\n### 2.5. In vivo optical stimulation of the DH or VH \n  \nAdult male C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks old) were used for these experiments. Stereotaxic-guided (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) virus injections were performed as described above. Mice were injected unilaterally (ipsilateral to the peripheral injury) with 250 nL of AAV5-Syn-ChR2-eYFP (Hope Center Viral Vector Core, viral titer 2 × 10  vg/mL) into the DH (bregma −1.85 mm; lateral −1.0 mm; ventral −2.0 mm) or VH (bregma −3.5 mm; lateral −2.9 mm; ventral −4.35 mm). The injection pipette was withdrawn 5 minutes after the infusion, and the scalp was then sealed. After allowing 3 weeks for sufficient ChR2 expression, mice skulls were implanted in the injected area with thin, flexible, light weight, battery-free, wirelessly powered μ-ILED (Cree, Inc Durham, NC, USA, 470 nm in wavelength, 220 × 270 × 50 µm) devices. Each device contains a power receiving coil with diameter ∼10 mm. The needle portion of the device incorporating the μ-ILED interconnects with the coil through stretchable serpentine traces and can be inserted into the DH or VH, as previously described.  Briefly, the coordinates of the needle tips of the devices are 200 μm lateral and deeper than the coordinates for the virus injections. The device was fixed in place using a small amount of cyanoacrylate gel. All mice were single housed for 3 days after the implantation and were then put back with their former littermates. The devices remained intact and provide a robust optical performance while implanted in the targeted areas. \n\nSpared nerve injury surgeries were performed 1 week after hippocampal fiber implantation. Prestimulation baselines for paw withdrawal threshold and place preference were assessed on post-SNI day 7. The wireless photostimulation-paired rtCPP tests were performed on post-SNI day 8 to 11 (twice per day). Paw withdrawal thresholds were examined on post-SNI day 30. The DH and VH were stimulated using wireless photostimulation devices (Neurolux, Urbana, IL; output 7 W, 2-ms pulses at a 20 Hz frequency). Channelrhodopsin-2 expression was verified post hoc using fluorescence microscopy on brain sections. \n\n\n### 2.6. Real-time conditioned place preference test using optical stimulation \n  \nThe CPP apparatus consists of 2 connected compartments (30 × 30 × 30 cm each) with distinct tactile and visual cues. On the prestimulation session (Pre-stim on SNI day 7), the mice were placed into each of the chambers and allowed to freely explore both for 15 minutes, with no stimulation at any time. In subsequent stimulation sessions (Stim S1-S8 from SNI day 8-day 11, twice 15-minute sessions per day), the mouse entry into 1 compartment activated a wirelessly powered photostimulation (Neurolux) operating at 13.56 MHz (wireless system output 7 W, 2-ms pulses, frequency: 20 Hz) as long as the mouse remained in the stimulation-paired compartment, whereas entry into the other compartment did not cause any photostimulation. For each mouse, the less preferred compartment during the preconditioning phase was used as the stimulation-paired assigned side. White noise was played during all sessions to block out any possible extraneous acoustic cues. The time spent in the stimulation-paired side and the time in the center area of the stimulation side were measured in each session using Any-maze tracking software. Preference was calculated as the time in the stimulation-paired side at each stimulation session minus the time in the stimulation-paired side during the prestimulation session. \n\n\n### 2.7. Von Frey assessment during continuous optical stimulation \n  \nThe arena consists of a single compartment (30 × 30 × 30 cm). Mice were placed into the chamber and allowed to freely explore it for 15 minutes. During this time, they were continuously stimulated using a wirelessly powered photostimulation (Neurolux). White noise was played during all sessions to block out any possible extraneous acoustic cues. Tactile thresholds were assessed before and after the photostimulation. \n\n\n### 2.8. In vivo chemogenetic activation of the hippocampus \n  \nAdult (8-10 weeks; 200-250 g) male Sprague-Dawley rats were group-housed until surgery. As previously described,  stereotaxic-guided virus injection surgeries were performed under isoflurane anesthesia (1.5%-2.5%) and a mixture of 30% N O and 70% O  using a stereotaxic instrument (Kopf Instruments). Four small holes (2 per side) were drilled through the skull, and bilateral virus injections were made using a glass injection pipette (Drummond Scientific Company). To activate the DH, we injected AAV9-SYN-PSAM-L141F-Y115F-5HT3HC-GFP (PSAM, titer: 2.19 × 10  genomes/mL, Virovek IncHayward, CA, USA) bilaterally using the following coordinates (bregma −3 mm; lateral ±1.7 mm; ventral −3.3 mm for the more rostral location; bregma −4.2 mm; lateral ±2.7; ventral −3.3 mm for the more caudal location; 500 nL/side) at a speed of 100 nL per minute. Head posts were implanted 2 to 3 weeks after virus injection. After a 2-week acclimation period, SNI surgeries were performed, and 4 to 5 days after SNI surgery, paw withdrawal thresholds were assessed before and 0.5 to 2 hours after i.p. injection of either saline or PSEM  (30 mg/kg). After completion of the experiments, the injection sites were verified by immunohistochemistry. \n\n\n### 2.9. In vivo chemogenetic activation of the hippocampus combined with naloxone treatment \n  \nAdult (8-10 weeks; 200-250 g) male Sprague-Dawley rats were group-housed until surgery. Stereotaxic-guided virus injection surgeries were performed as described above. To activate the DH, AAV9-SYN-PSAM-L141F-Y115F-5HT3HC-GFP (PSAM, titer: 2.19 × 10  genomes/mL, Virovek, Inc) was injected bilaterally in the anterior and the posterior DH, 500 nL/side. Spared nerve injury/sham surgery was performed 4 weeks after virus injection. Five days after surgery, the rats received an i.p. injection of PSEM  (30 mg/kg) followed by a second i.p. injection of either naloxone (5 mg/kg) or saline 30 minutes after the first injection. Two days later, rats that had received PSEM  and naloxone were injected with PSEM  and saline, and vice versa. The paw withdrawal threshold was assessed before neuropathic injury and then again before and 1 hour after i.p. PSEM  injection. \n\n\n### 2.10. Electrophysiology \n  \nSagittal brain slices containing the hippocampus were obtained from PSAM virus–injected rats. Rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and perfused transcardially with ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH PO , 2.0 CaCl , 1.0 MgCl , 25 NaHCO , and 25 glucose, saturated with 95% O  and 5% CO ). Brains were rapidly removed and sliced (VT1200S vibratome; Leica Microsystems Chicago, IL, USA), and the slices were then incubated and transferred into the recording chamber. GFP-positive pyramidal neurons were patched and recorded in current clamp. Pipettes (3-5 MΩ in working solution) were filled with (in mM): 140 KMeSO , 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg ATP, 0.4 NaGTP, and 10 sodium phosphocreatine. Signals were filtered at 5 kHz and acquired using a 10-kHz sample frequency. PSEM  was applied to the bath using a gravity-driven application system. Picrotoxin (100 μM), CNQX (10 μM), and D-AP5 (50 μM) were used to block fast synaptic transmission. \n\n\n### 2.11. Awake resting-state functional MRI \n  \nThese experiments closely followed methods we recently described. \n\n#### 2.11.1. Head-post implantation \n  \nSurgery for head-post implantation was performed under anesthesia. Rats were initially anesthetized with 3.5% isoflurane mixed with 30% N  and 70% O , and then transferred to a stereotaxic device and mounted using blunt ear bars that do not break the eardrums. Anesthesia was continued at a lower isoflurane concentration (1.5%-2.5%) sufficient to block motor responses to pinching the hind limbs. The head fur was shaved, and the eyes covered with ointment to prevent drying out and corneal infection. After disinfecting the skin overlying the skull, the scalp was cut longitudinally, and the skin retracted from the cranium. The head post was placed at the midpoint of the bregma and lambda and fixed to the skull with dental cement. The skin wound was treated with triple antibiotic ointment. The rats were then released from the stereotaxic frame and kept warm using a heat lamp. After head-post implantation, rats were given at least 2 weeks of rest to recover from the surgical preparation before the start of acclimation procedures. \n\n\n#### 2.11.2. Acclimation procedure \n  \nFor awake scanning, rats first received a surgical implantation of a head post to aid stabilization during scanning. They then received acclimation training in which they were first introduced to snuggle sacks until they began to voluntarily walk into them. Subsequently, snuggle sacks were adjusted around the rats for a snug fit. Once acclimated to their snuggle sacks, the rats were transferred to cradles and then secured to cradles with Velcro straps. The head plate was affixed to the head and subsequently secured to sidewalls mounted on the cradle. Rodents were then acclimated to the head restraint with a graded training procedure. Once the rats became used to the device, their head was screwed to the head-plate that was securely mounted on the cradle. To reduce the stress induced by the MRI experimental environment, rodents were exposed to digital recordings of the sounds generated by gradient switching in the magnet during fMRI, so they were familiar with loud and sudden noise that mimics a typical MRI session. Rats were habituated to the body restrain system and the MRI environment in 30-minute sessions/day for 8 to 10 days, within a 2-week period. They were first habituated to the mock scanner box that simulated the MRI scanner environment and, during later times, to the MRI scanner. Rodents were rewarded with treats at the end of each session. The acclimation training was performed after the head-post implantation and before the SNI surgery, and it was repeated after surgery prior the collection of the imaging data. \n\n\n#### 2.11.3. Awake functional magnetic resonance imaging \n  \nOn day 4 or 5 after peripheral surgery, each rat underwent a sequence of 3 imaging scans assessed on the same day at baseline (no injection) and the other 2 scans at 1 hour after the systemic injections. The order of the saline and PSEM  injections was randomized between rats, and at least 2-hour period was left between injections to exclude any remaining effect of the drug. A total of 9 rats were used for these experiments. Rats whose head post became detached during retraining sessions were not imaged. In addition, data from 1 rat at baseline session with excessive motion artifacts were likewise discarded. Thus, we retained scans for 7 SNI rats after 1 hour of PSEM  and saline and 6 rats at baseline. \n\n\n#### 2.11.4. Equipment for awake rodent functional magnetic resonance imaging \n  \nThe instruments—including MRI holder, cradle, head plate, head post, and mock scanner box—were designed using SolidWorks software and were three-dimensional printed (ProofX, IL) using a semitransparent, medical grade material (PolyJet photopolymer MED610, Stratasys) that we had previously tested for magnetic susceptibility. Screws (Small Parts) and fastener were made with Ultem PEI polyetherimide. Custom-made “snuggle sacks” were designed to tailor for rats weighing 300 to 400 g. Snuggle sacks included openings that provided access to the head post. More details can be found in  . \n\n\n#### 2.11.5. Magnetic resonance imaging acquisition \n  \nAll magnetic resonance experiments were performed on a Bruker 7T ClinScan horizontal magnet. A 2-channel volume resonator was used for radiofrequency transmission, and a 2-cm-diameter surface coil was used for signal detection. Blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) contrast-sensitive T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging was acquired for functional images with the following parameters: gradient-echo, 26 oblique transverse slices, repetition time 2007.5 ms, echo time (TE) 18 milliseconds, in-plane resolution 0.348 mm, slice thickness 0.5 mm, and number of repetition 240. Additional images were collected to optimize registration, including a T2-weighted anatomical image, having identical spatial dimension as in the functional images. EKG and body temperature were continuously monitored during all fMRI experiments. \n\n\n#### 2.11.6. Image preprocessing \n  \nFunctional MRI data were preprocessed using FSL 5.1 FEAT (FMRIB's Software Library,  ) default settings and included motion correction with MCFLIRT, interleaved slice timing correction, skull removal, and spatial smoothing (using FWHM) with a Gaussian kernel of 0.7 mm (not default), chosen because it is roughly 1.5 times the largest dimension of the voxel. BOLD time courses were forward and backward band-pass filtered at 0.01 to 0.08 Hz with a fourth-order Butterworth. Functional images were then registered using FLIRT, first to the individual anatomical T2 image with 6 degrees of freedom (not default), and then, this was registered linearly to the standard brain using 12 degrees of freedom. We used an in-house manually drawn template to identify CSF and white matter voxels in a standard brain image. Average time courses from all the white matter and CSF as well as those pertaining to global whole brain signal were extracted using the FSL fslmeants function. Cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, global signals, and 6 motion parameters (3 translation and 3 rotation) were regressed out from the images using FSL's fsl regfilt linear regression function. \n\n\n#### 2.11.7. Functional networks \n  \nWe also constructed a functional connectivity (FC) network for the whole brain to examine its properties between PSEM  and saline conditions, especially for the nodes where PSAM was expressed. The procedure closely followed our earlier methodology.  Briefly, the brains were segmented to 96 regions of interest (ROIs, 48 per hemisphere) using a standard rat atlas.  The time courses of the BOLD signals for all voxels in each ROI were averaged. Resultant average BOLD signals were used to calculate Pearson correlation coefficients between pairs of ROIs resulting in a 96 × 96 correlation matrix per scan. Data from scans 1 and 2, for PSEM  and saline injections (14 scans per condition), were used to determine FC changes between PSEM  and saline conditions. We next calculated average correlation matrices of each condition and the absolute difference between the PSEM  and saline averages. To evaluate the statistical significance of these changes, we used a permutation test, where we randomized the labels of the correlation matrices, and calculated the difference between the new groups. We repeated the randomization 50,000 times to obtain the null hypothesis distribution for each pairwise connection—the distribution of probable changes in the strength of a connection when the groups are not necessarily different. We then used the null hypothesis distributions to select the connections with a statistically significant change (one-tailed   P   value < 0.05). \n\n\n#### 2.11.8. Seed-based connectivity \n  \nFunctional connectivity maps for the 4 seeds where the PSAM virus was injected were generated in Matlab. We extracted the average BOLD time series from 3-voxel radius spheres surrounding the virus injection coordinates from functional images registered to standard space and each average was correlated against all voxels in the brain using Pearson's correlation. Average FC maps across all 4 seeds were then contrasted between PSEM  and saline injection conditions (paired within rat contrasts). We then performed a higher-level analysis to identify FC changes correlated with the changes in allodynic threshold of the injured paw between PSEM  and saline conditions. Individual rat FC difference maps (PSEM  vs saline) were correlated with change in tactile allodynia between PSEM  and saline. FSL FLAMEO was again used to identify z-stat maps, corrected for multiple comparisons using intensity z > 2.3 and cluster   P   < 0.05 thresholds. The analysis just described constituted the discovery phase, which was based on 1 set of fMRI scans collected in each rat, at 1 hour after PSEM  or saline injections. We also collected a second fMRI scan immediately after termination of the first, and this scan was reserved for a replication analysis. Preprocessing and postprocessing steps for the replication data were identical to those used for the discovery phase. However, resultant maps were not thresholded, as we only extracted FC values for the regions of interest. These replication maps, reflecting individual rat-, seed-, and condition-specific outcomes, were used to extract FC values at the coordinates of interest derived from the discovery results. Resultant regions were considered to be reproducibly, and with minimal bias, reflecting tactile changes only if the joint   P   value, for observed correlations between discovery and replication, was significant at   P   < 0.0025 (0.05*0.05). Only 3 (of 8 tested; 4 positive and 4 negative FC changes) regions survived this criterion. \n\nIn the virus-injected rats, we collected one more resting-state fMRI immediately after determining tactile thresholds 4 to 5 days after SNI, but just before saline or PSEM  injections. We used the same preprocessing and postprocessing steps for these scans as well. These data were only used to extract the mean FC map across the 4 seeds. \n\n\n\n### 2.12. Data quantification and statistics \n  \nData were expressed as mean ± SEM (for before–after comparisons) or as median and quartiles (for a small number of observations). One-way or two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures followed by post hoc tests for mean ± SEM data and the paired   t   test for before–after data was performed to analyze the behavioral outcomes. The criterion of statistical significance was   P   < 0.05. Although no power analysis was performed, the sample size was determined according to peers' and our previous publications in behavioral and pertinent molecular studies. No randomization was used for data collection, but all initial analyses were performed blinded to the condition of the experiments. All brain imaging maps were corrected for multiple comparisons, and the final regions of interest were limited to ones that survived our rigorous discovery and replication procedure. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1 Pharmacologic manipulation of hippocampal excitability \n  \nTo establish the role of the hippocampus in the neuropathic pain phenotype, we first tested the effect of local injection of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (21.2 pmol in 1 µL volume) into either the DH or the VH (ipsilaterally to the peripheral SNI) on tactile allodynia in male sham-operated and SNI-operated rats. We found that glutamate injection into the DH had a potent analgesic effect in SNI where the decrease in the tactile threshold was almost completely reversed (tactile threshold increased by >9 folds;   P   < 0.001), but the same injection had minimal effects in sham rats (tactile threshold increased only by ∼20%;   P   = 0.09, Fig.  A). Interestingly, the effect of a single injection in SNI rats lasted for up to 2 days, after which it was fully reversed to initial allodynia levels. This pattern was fully reproduced with a second injection, a few days after recovery from the first injection, where we observed complete relief of tactile allodynia for 2 days (Fig.  A). Reversal of tactile allodynia with glutamate injection in the DH (ipsilateral to SNI) was replicated in female rats and also when glutamate was injected in the DH contralaterally or bilaterally relative to the SNI side (Fig. S1, available at  ). We also found that the effect of glutamate injection into the DH was dose dependent, reducing the dose resulted in pain relief lasting only for 1 day (5.3 pmol in 1 µL), and this analgesia was abolished if the NMDA antagonist AP5 was injected 30 minutes before glutamate (Fig.  B), thus showing that the glutamate effect requires the activation of NMDA receptors. Next, we investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of the hippocampus would modulate tactile allodynia in SNI. To this end, 2 new cohorts of rats were microinfused with indiplon (5.3 pmol in 1 µL), a positive allosteric modulator of GABA  receptors,  using the same DH and VH coordinates as used for the glutamate injections. In contrast with the glutamate effect, indiplon injection into the DH had no effects in SNI rats but caused a transient proalgesic effect in sham rats (Fig.  C). Importantly, the glutamate effect was reproducible also in SNL rats (Fig.  E), a different model of neuropathic pain.  Next, we used the same pharmacological approach to test whether the modulation of the VH similarly affects pain perception in SNI and sham rats. In contrast with the DH data, neither glutamate (Fig.  A) nor indiplon (Fig.  C) injections into the VH produced any detectable effect on tactile allodynia. Taken together, the data show a clear dichotomy between the DH and VH with regard to the modulation of neuropathy-induced tactile allodynia. However, intrahippocampal drug injections have known pitfalls that complicate the interpretation of the functional outcomes. One drawback is that the speed and extent of the drug spread are hard to predict and to measure. Consequently, the effective drug concentration is unclear, which is an important concern particularly when dealing with desensitizing receptors. In addition, the precise time constant of the effect onset and offset relative to neuronal activity may be difficult to determine. \n  \nGlutamate, but not indiplon, in the dorsal hippocampus reversed pain-like behaviors after SNI or SNL neuropathic injuries in rats. (A) Microinjection of glutamate (21.2 pmol in 1 µL volume) but not saline into the dorsal hippocampus (ipsilateral to SNI) reversed SNI-induced tactile allodynia. This effect lasted for 2 days and was replicated by a second injection of glutamate (n = 6 rats per group). (B) Coapplication of glutamate (5.3 pmol) with NMDA receptor antagonist APV in the dorsal hippocampus (5 nmol in 1 µL volume, 30 minutes before 5.3 pmol glutamate injection) diminished the effect of glutamate on SNI-induced tactile allodynia (n = 9 rats per group). Note the lower dose of glutamate resulted in shorter duration pain relief. (C) In Sham but not in SNI rats, activation of GABA  receptors in the dorsal hippocampus by infusion of indiplon (positive allosteric modulator of GABA  receptors, 10 pmol in 1 µL volume) decreased the tactile thresholds (n = 6 rats per group). (D) Representative coronal sections and histological verification for implanted cannulas. (E) In L5 SNL-induced neuropathic pain model, tactile allodynia on ipsilateral hind paws was reversed by glutamate microinjected into the dorsal hippocampus (5.3 pmol in 1 µL volume, n = 6 per group). Post hoc statistical significance of differences is indicated as follows: ***  P   < 0.0001 and ns   P   > 0.05 (compared with −1 hour before glutamate injection), #  P   < 0.05 (compared with the glutamate-treated SNI group at corresponding time from the start of testing). For detailed statistics, see Table S1, available at  . SNI, spared nerve injury; SNL, spinal nerve ligation. \n    \nPharmacological modulation by glutamate or indiplon in the ventral hippocampus had no effect on the tactile thresholds in either SNI or Sham rats. (A) Ventral hippocampus microinjection of glutamate (21.2 pmol in 1 µL volume) or saline did not change the tactile thresholds in either Sham or SNI rats (n = 5 per group). (B) Representative coronal sections and histological verification for implanted cannulas. (C) Indiplon (10 pmol in 1 µL volume) in the ventral hippocampus had no effect on the tactile thresholds in either Sham or SNI rats (n = 5 per group). ns   P   > 0.05 (compared with −1 hour before glutamate or indiplon injections). For detailed statistics, see Table S1 for all statistical tests, available at  . SNI, spared nerve injury. \n  \n\n### 3.2. Optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal activity \n  \nTo overcome, at least in part, uncertainties associated with pharmacology, we designed a set of experiments to selectively modulate hippocampal excitability using an optogenetic approach. To this end, AAV-ChR2-GFP was injected into either the DH or the VH of sham and SNI mice (Fig.  A). Acute slice recordings confirmed that ChR2 was expressed and functional in hippocampal neurons (Fig.  B). Similar to the pharmacological manipulations, tactile allodynia was inhibited by optogenetic stimulation of the DH, but not the VH (Figs.  C and D). Thus, both pharmacological and optogenetic activation of the DH (but not the VH) reversed tactile allodynia in SNI rodents. Note the pharmacologic manipulation of the DH and VH was tested at 7 and/or 11 days after SNI/sham surgeries, whereas continuous DH or VH optogenetic activation was tested at 28 and 23 days after SNI, respectively. Although the time from peripheral injury to optogenetic activation does not match between DH and VH experiments, the DH study resulted in analgesia was at a later time (day 28); thus, the negative results seen with VH stimulation (day 23) cannot be due to virus inefficiency. More importantly, DH-dependent pain relief at 28 days after SNI suggests that the DH control of neuropathic pain is persistent for a duration where the condition may be considered transitioning to a more chronic state. \n  \nContinuous optogenetic activation of the dorsal, but not the ventral, hippocampus alleviated tactile allodynia in SNI mice. (A) Sample slices display expression of ChR2-GFP in virus injection sites: dorsal hippocampus (DH, left) or ventral hippocampus (VH, right). Intended targets, relative to the bregma, for implanting the optical device are shown in smaller images. (B) Slice recording shows depolarization and spiking evoked in GFP-positive dorsal hippocampal neurons with photostimulation. (C) On SNI day 28, continuous photostimulation of dorsal hippocampal neurons is sufficient to relieve tactile allodynia, at around 3 hours after dorsal hippocampus stimulation (20 Hz stimulation for 15 minutes, n = 7). No effect is observed in Sham mice (n = 9). (D) On SNI day 23, a similar but smaller effect was detected with ventral hippocampus stimulation (20 Hz stimulation for 15 minutes). Hippocampal stimulation is ineffective on Sham mice (n = 5 mice per group). Post hoc statistically significant differences are indicated as follows: ***   P   < 0.0001 and ns   P   > 0.05 (compared with −1 hour before stimulation). For detailed statistics, see Table S1, available at  . SNI, spared nerve injury. \n  \nTactile allodynia, however, only represents one of many symptoms of neuropathic pain. To investigate whether other behaviors are similarly modulated, we took advantage of   wireless real-time place preference   (opto-rtCPP) experiments to test whether optogenetic stimulation of the hippocampus affects place preference in SNI mice. It should be noted that opto-rtCPP has the added advantage that both the hippocampus stimulation paradigm and behavior assessment are fully automated; thus, obtained results should be minimally contaminated with operator influences. In keeping with the findings on tactile allodynia, optogenetic activation of the DH, but not the VH, induced strong preference for the stimulated chamber in SNI, but not sham, mice (Fig.  ). Therefore, opto-rtCPP uncovers motivated behavior exhibiting preference for DH (not VH) stimulation only in SNI (not sham) mice. Thus, all the data concur that activation of the DH, but not the VH, improves pain-related phenotypes in neuropathic animal models, without apparent effects in sham-operated animals. \n  \nActivation of the dorsal, but not the ventral hippocampus is sufficient to drive preferred behavior in SNI mice. (A) Schematic representation of the behavioral paradigm for the   real-time conditioned place preference   (rtCPP) test. (B) Representative heat maps of SNI and Sham mice activity during habituation (prestimulation) and last stimulation sessions (S8) of rtCPP (20 Hz, 15 mins/session, DH optical stimulation). (C) Preference in seconds, measured by time in the stimulation-paired chamber at a given session minus time in the stimulation-paired chamber at prestimulation habituation session during rtCPP optical stimulation (20 Hz) of the dorsal hippocampus in ChR2-expressing SNI (red, n = 5) and Sham (white, n = 10) mice. (D) Representative heat maps of SNI and Sham mice activity during habituation (prestimulation) and last stimulation sessions (S8) of rtCPP (20 Hz, 15 mins/session, VH optical stimulation). (E) In contrast with dorsal hippocampus rtCPP, ventral hippocampus optical stimulation showed no preference for the stimulation-paired chamber for SNI (blue, n = 5) and Sham (n = 5) mice. Post hoc statistically significant differences are indicated as *  P   < 0.05, **  P   < 0.05, and ns   P   > 0.05 (compared with habituation, h2). For detailed statistics, see Table S1, available at  . SNI, spared nerve injury. \n  \n\n### 3.3. Chemogenetics and functional magnetic resonance imaging \n  \nTo prove DH neuronal engagement in neuropathic pain and investigate the identity of the neuronal network underlying the effects induced by hippocampal modulation, we combined chemogenetic tools with awake resting-state fMRI in rats. The chemogenetic approach, in contrast to pharmacological or optogenetic methods, is a more subtle and specific assessment of the role of infected neurons in a given condition, as it tests whether unmasking of positive modulation of endogenous excitability of neurons infected by PSAM (by PSEM ) would modify a given behavior and also identify related functional circuitry (chemo-fMRI). Thus, the approach establishes that the infected neurons are engaged in the task and that the level of their excitability (rather than direct activation) is linked to the behavior. To this end, we infected the DH bilaterally at 4 sites, hoping to improve the probability of observing behavioral and fMRI outcomes during increased excitability. First, we verified the efficiency of the viral-mediated expression of excitatory (5-HT3 channel-coupled) PSAM in the DH (Fig.  A) by testing the effect of the PSAM agonist PSEM  (10 µM) on intrinsic excitability of infected hippocampal neurons (Figs.  B and C). Next, we activated the DH by injecting PSEM  (30 mg/kg; i.p.). We found a robust analgesic effect (an increase in the allodynic threshold of the injured paw) in SNI rats, which was never detected in PSAM-infected rats that received saline injections or in PSEM-injected sham-operated rats (Fig.  D). Thus, chemogenetic, optogenetic, and pharmacological activation of the DH all have similar effects. Finally, we tested whether the DH effect on tactile allodynia could be linked to the activation of opioid receptors. To this end, we treated PSAM-expressing SNI and sham rats with either saline or the µ-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (5 mg/kg; 30 minutes after a 30 mg/kg PSEM  i.p. injection; Fig.  E). After another 30 minutes, we tested tactile allodynia. Interestingly, naloxone completely abolished the analgesic effect of PSEM  injection, showing that the analgesic effect of DH stimulation requires the activation of µ-opioid receptors. No effect of PSEM  or naloxone was detected in sham rats (Fig.  F). \n  \nChemogenetically increasing excitability of dorsal hippocampal neurons diminishes neuropathic tactile allodynia in SNI rats, abolished by naloxone. (A) In AAV—SYN-PSAM-L141F-Y115F-5HT3HC-GFP–infected rats GFP fluorescence specific for the dorsal hippocampal neurons. (B–C) Slice recording showing the rapid depolarization and spiking evoked in GFP-positive dorsal hippocampal neurons by bath application of PSEM  (10 µM). (D) In PSAM-5HT3–infected SNI rats, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of PSEM  (30 mg/kg) rapidly and reversibly blunted tactile allodynia of the SNI ipsilateral paw, on day 5 after SNI, whereas the treatment with saline did not perturb tactile sensitivity of SNI (n = 4 per group). (E) Experimental timeline: Rats were first injected with AAV9-SYN-PSAM-L141F-Y115F-5HT3HC-GFP virus into the bilateral dorsal hippocampus (∼4 weeks before SNI/Sham surgeries). One day before SNI/Sham injury, tactile thresholds were assessed (baseline VF). Spared nerve injury/Sham surgeries were then performed unilaterally. Five days after surgery, tactile thresholds (−1 hour) were assessed, and afterwards, rats received PSEM  injections (i.p.) followed by another i.p. injection of either naloxone or saline 30 minutes after. Tactile thresholds were assessed 1 hour after the first injection. Two days later, rats that had received PSEM  and naloxone were injected with PSEM  and saline, and vice versa, and tactile thresholds were assessed again. (F) PSEM  injection in the virus expressed SNI rats (n = 16) showed a reduction of SNI-induced tactile allodynia. This effect was fully abolished by naloxone. By contrast, the tactile threshold of sham rats (n = 4) was unchanged by naloxone. Post hoc statistically significant differences are indicated as follows: #  P   < 0.01, ##  P   < 0.05, * < 0.05, and ns   P   > 0.05 (between before and after PSEM or saline ± naloxone or saline). For detailed statistics, see Table S1, available at  . rtCPP, real-time conditioned place preference; SNI, spared nerve injury. \n  \nNext, we aimed to identify the brain network mediating the effect of hippocampal activation on the neuropathic pain phenotype. We paired chemogenetic activation of the DH with resting-state fMRI in awake rats, chemo-fMRI (Fig.  A). Spared nerve injury rats expressing PSAM in the DH received an i.p. injection of either PSEM  or saline; they underwent Von Frey testing and then received 2 complete resting-state fMRI scans. Because the PSEM -induced analgesia peaked at 1 hour after injection (Supp. Fig. S1, available at  ), the 2 scans were completed between 60 and 90 minutes from the injection. Three hours later, the rat cohorts were swapped so that those that had received saline injections now received PSEM  and vice versa, and they underwent the same protocol (injection, Von Frey test, 2 scans; Fig.  A). Again, chemogenetically increasing excitability of the DH significantly blunted the SNI-induced tactile allodynia, and we then analyzed the impact of the chemogenetic activation of DH on whole brain functional network properties. We used data from both scans 1 and 2 to enhance statistical power. By examining the difference in FC of 4 seeds (PSAM injection coordinates) within the DH when the rats received either saline or PSEM , we identified multiple brain areas where connectivity with the DH was either increased or decreased following chemogenetically increasing excitability of the DH (Figs.  B and C). Overall, we observed twice as many connections increasing in strength than decreasing (Fig.  D). Regarding the 4 DH nodes, increased connectivity was mainly found with cortical targets, whereas decreases mostly concerned subcortical structures (Table S2, available at  ). We did not detect any obvious differences in connectivity patterns between the 4 DH nodes (shown in green). \n  \nAwake chemo-fMRI functional network reorganization with increasing excitability of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) in rats: Subdividing the brain into 96 clusters identifies whole-brain and dorsal hippocampus connectivity changes with increased DH excitability. (A) Experimental timeline: Rats (n = 7) were first injected with AAV9-SYN-PSAM-L141F-Y115F-5HT3HC-GFP virus into the bilateral dorsal hippocampus (∼9 weeks before SNI surgery). Two weeks later, they received head-posts (∼7 weeks) and then underwent a 2-week training period to enable awake resting-state fMRI; 1 to 2 days before SNI injury, baseline tactile thresholds were assessed for left and right hind paws (BL VF). Spared nerve injury surgery was then performed unilaterally. Four or 5 days after surgery, tactile thresholds (T0) were assessed, and the rats scanned for resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI); immediately afterwards, rats received either saline or PSEM  injections (i.p.), retested for tactile thresholds, and again underwent awake rsfMRI (2 consecutive scans). Two hours later, rats that had received PSEM  were injected with saline, and vice versa, and tactile thresholds and rsfMRI were assessed one more time. (B–C), Dorsal and lateral views of change in network connectivity with increased DH excitability, comparing PSEM  with the saline injection conditions. Change in connectivity across all nodes is shown in gray; increased and decreased connectivity for the 4 DH seeds (green) are shown in red and blue, respectively. (D) Histogram of the significant changes in the average correlation coefficient for PSEM  in contrast to saline: Contrasts were performed combining scan 1 and 2 data, using permutation testing,   P   < 0.05 (see Table S2 for statistical details, available at  ). A, anterior; D, dorsal; L, left; P, posterior; R, right; SNI, spared nerve injury; V, ventral. \n  \nNext, we combined the results from the behavioral and the fMRI analysis to assess whether DH-driven changes in FC could be related to tactile allodynia. We first generated maps of FC changes between PSEM  and saline conditions and performed a correlation analysis to directly relate these changes with changes in tactile thresholds (a list of regions is presented in Table S3, available at  ); 3 of these regions survived the replication step: primary somatosensory cortex (limb region), dorsolateral thalamus, and primary somatosensory cortex (barrel region; Fig.  A). Figure  C shows the (negative) correlation between changes in FC and allodynic threshold for discovery and replication groups for the barrel region of the primary somatosensory cortex, where we observe a negative correlation between changes in FC and in allodynic threshold of the SNI hind paw (but not for the non-SNI paw). Figures  D and E show discovery and replication scatter plots for the dorsolateral thalamus (Fig.  D) and the limb region of the primary somatosensory cortex (Fig.  E). In both regions, discovery and replication indicate a positive correlation between changes in FC and tactile allodynia of the SNI hind paw (but no correlation for the non-SNI paw). \n  \nAwake chemo-fMRI identifies dorsal hippocampal–driven functional networks that reflect change in tactile allodynia as a function of increased dorsal hippocampal excitability in rats. (A) The map delineates brain regions where functional connectivity changes (ΔFC; between PSEM and saline conditions) were correlated with change in tactile allodynia (ΔThreshold; between PSEM and saline conditions), for stimulating the SNI hind paw (using only scan 1 data) (cluster corrected for multiple comparisons. Table S3, available at  , summarizes identified regions and associated statistics). Standard atlas slices are also illustrated. (B) Group median (quartiles and minimum/maximum) tactile thresholds are shown, for the SNI hind paw (red) and healthy hind paw (gray). Tactile thresholds for the SNI hind paw diminished at 1 hour after PSEM , but not after saline. Post hoc comparisons **  P   < 0.01 (between baseline and post-SNI, T0; also between T0 SNI and SNI + PSEM). (C) Average scatter plots across all 4 seeds for the primary somatosensory cortex (barrel field) between ΔFC and ΔThreshold are shown for discovery and replication groups for the SNI (red) and healthy hind paw (gray). We observe the SNI hind paw ΔThreshold is negatively correlated with the average ΔFC, but not for the non-SNI hind paw. Thus, we consider this brain regional FC a reliable outcome, indicating that high FC values in the region are related with high neuropathic pain (yellow circle at z = −2.8 mm in (A)). (D and E) Two additional brain regions identified in the discovery data could be replicated (yellow circles at z = −2.0 mm and z = 2.0 mm in (A)). In both regions, dorsolateral thalamus (D) and primary somatosensory cortex (limb region) (E), discovery and replication results show a positive relationship between ΔFC and ΔThreshold for the SNI hind paw, but not for the non-SNI hind paw. Thus, in these 2 regions, high FC values (in PSEM ) are associated with decreased neuropathic pain. Only across-seeds group averages are displayed. SNI, spared nerve injury. \n  \n\n### 3.4. Anterograde projections from the dorsal hippocampus and ventral hippocampus \n  \nAlthough projections of the DH and VH have been described,  direct examination of these projections using modern tracing methods is lacking. Therefore, in 2 mice, we traced DH (anterior or septal pole) and VH projections using the state-of-the-art anterograde labeling technique (supplementary Fig. 3, available at  ). The DH and VH showed nonoverlapping projections to multiple brain areas. The DH innervation of the mPFC, BLA, and VH was scarce, whereas the VH densely innervated all these areas. Projections in the septum and mamillary complex were complementary: the DH projected to the dorsal septum and the VH to the intermediate lateral and ventral septum; the DH to dorsal mammillary and the VH to ventral mammillary nuclei; the DH to the posterior dorsal ACC and the VH to the posterior ventral ACC. Both the DH and VH projected to the PAG but the VH more densely than the DH. Interestingly, although we found no projections from the DH to VH, tracing of VH projections revealed DH terminals that were especially dense in the stratum lacunosum moleculare. \n\n\n### 3.5. Functional connectivity of the anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus in humans with back pain \n  \nTo explore possible human correlates of the differential involvement of the DH and VH in neuropathic pain, we tested whether the FC of the PH and AH to the cortex exhibits distinct properties in subjects with back pain. Both positive and negative FCs were studied. However, only negative FC showed regional differences. Supplementary Figure 4 demonstrates that PH-cortex negative FC was distinct between healthy controls, subjects with subacute back pain, and subjects with chronic back pain and significantly less in chronic back pain in comparison with subacute back pain. By contrast, AH-cortex negative FC did not differ between the 3 groups examined (available at  ). \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nWe used a multiplicity of strategies to investigate the respective roles of the DH and VH in neuropathic pain in rats and mice. The main results of our study are (1)   activation   of the DH, but not the VH, had analgesic effects in SNI (and SNL), but not sham-operated, mice (and rats) regarding tactile sensitivity and motivated behavior; (2) pharmacological   inhibition   of the DH had proalgesic effects in sham-operated, but not SNI, mice; (3) the analgesic effect of DH stimulation in SNI mice was NMDA dependent and required activation of µ-opioid receptors; and (4) chemogenetically increasing excitability of DH neurons was sufficient to induce analgesia in SNI rats. Awake resting-state chemo-fMRI identified underlying functional network changes, and DH functional connections to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex correlated with observed analgesia. Together, these results show a causal relationship between DH, but not VH, neural activity in neuropathic pain and imply that the DH local circuitry and FC are deactivated in neuropathic pain. In addition, we show evidence for the DH and VH exhibiting distinct anatomical projections in the mouse and in humans negative FC showing distinct properties in the AH and PH between healthy, subacute, and chronic back pain subjects. \n\n### 4.1. Neuropathic pain along the long axis of the hippocampus—rodent studies \n  \nFunctional segregation along the long axis of the hippocampus remains an evolving topic.  There may be important differences in this organization between primates and rodents, and it remains unclear the extent to which functional differences constitute a gradient or comprise a constellation of discrete modules or some combination of both.  Studies of hippocampal abnormalities and their contribution to rodent models of chronic pain are rapidly increasing. Yet, majority concentrate on abnormalities in cognitive, memory, anxiety, and depression-like behaviors (see Refs  ). The current results are the first to suggest a strict dichotomy between the DH and VH regarding neuropathic pain. Yet, within the DH, an exact location, specific neuronal populations, and underlying intrinsic circuitry controlling neuropathic pain remain unknown. \n\nThe DH plays a well-established role in episodic memories.  We recently demonstrated that the valence (positive and negative value) of memory traces within the DH is mediated by glutamatergic projections from the ventral tegmental area.  Thus, this pathway may be a route for reorganizing DH circuits with neuropathic pain, specifically regarding the motivational/emotional value control, which we could demonstrate in opto-rtCPP experiments. However, activation of the ventral tegmental area is not sufficient to induce reward-related behavioral responses,  suggesting that other additional inputs must also be involved. Regarding DH outputs and neuropathic pain, the chemo-fMRI evidence showed that increasing DH excitability leads to increased positive and negative FC to many brain targets, and FC to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex reflected changes in tactile allodynia, likely mediated through multisynaptic pathways because there are no known direct DH projections to these regions. \n\nAlthough activation of the VH did not modulate neuropathic pain, other evidence suggests that it undergoes reorganization and may contribute to anxiety/depression-type behaviors commonly associated with neuropathic pain. The VH exhibits neuroimmune activation after peripheral nerve injury and enhanced anxiety in susceptible animals.  Mice with persistent neuropathic pain show reduced active neural stem cells in the VH dentate gyrus and heightened anxiety, and fluoxetine increases the proliferation of active neural stem cells and alleviates anxiety without effecting tactile allodynia.  Complimenting these observations, we have shown a dissociation between neuropathic pain behavior and depression-like behaviors in transgenic mice, coupled with reduced neurogenesis and diminished learning abilities.  We have also shown that the synaptic strength of VH projections to the nucleus accumbens medial shell (D2-receptor expressing spiny projection neurons) is enhanced after SNI, and increasing excitability of these neurons exacerbates neuropathic pain.  However, because activation of the VH did not modulate neuropathic pain, the VH to the accumbens synapses by themselves is not sufficient to modify neuropathic behavior. Altogether, it seems that both the DH and VH undergo reorganization with neuropathic pain; the DH circuitry undergoes deactivation and exhibits ability to control neuropathic pain, whereas the VH shows increased connectivity contributing to anxiety/depression-like behaviors. \n\n\n### 4.2. Chronic pain along the long axis of the hippocampus—human studies \n  \nIn parallel and complimenting the rodent studies, human neuroimaging studies show hippocampal structural and functional abnormalities in various types of chronic pain.  Our studies indicate that hippocampal volume  and positive FC from the AH to the cortex  are both prognostic biomarkers for transition to chronic back pain. Moreover, a subportion of AH undergoes outward shape deformation in females transitioning to chronic back pain.  Importantly, a specific AH-cortex positive FC changes over time in proportion to changes in back pain  (which parallels increased VH-accumbens connectivity in SNI); a result recently replicated using a meta-analysis approach.  Thus, the bulk of prior evidence points to AH reorganization with chronic pain. Therefore, here, we re-examined our human data specifically to contrast FC between the AH and PH. The results indicate distinct reorganization for negative FC, demonstrating opposite patterns of reorganization in the AH and PH (in similarity to rodents with SNI). Earlier results indicate in chronic back pain that a specific PH regional shape is tightly related to the mismatch between experienced pain and its memory.  Thus, it is likely that the differences we see of PH-cortex negative FC may reflect pain memory distortions in back pain. \n\n\n### 4.3. What cellular mechanisms mediate the DH effect? \n  \nOur results are consistent with older observations. Rodent studies show decreased excitability of dorsal hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons and increased GABAergic activity in the formalin pain model,  and electrical stimulation of the DH leads to antinociceptive behaviors.  Abnormal hippocampal glutamatergic activity  and decreased hippocampal long-term potentiation are observed in neuropathic rats.  After chronic constriction injury, hippocampal CA1 glutamate concentration is decreased, whereas GABA concentration is increased and correlated with pain thresholds.  Also, DH inhibition of the GABAergic system by bicuculline increases antinociception, whereas muscimol promotes pronociception.  Thus, microinjection of glutamate in the dorsal hippocampus may reverse neuropathic pain by rebalancing local excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitters. \n\nSpared nerve injury animals are unable to extinguish contextual fear, which is associated with decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired plasticity.  This may suggest that the same DH dysfunctions that drive neuropathic pain also mediate the failure to extinguish fear. Such mechanisms include impaired synaptic plasticity,  likely mediated by NMDA channels.  In keeping with the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity, rather than simple cellular excitation, is critical for this effect; our present data show that NMDA blockade prevents the analgesia observed with DH activation. In addition, the persistence of the glutamate analgesia (consistent with the reduction of glutamate and glutamate transporter levels in the hippocampus in SNI ) further supports a critical role of long-term synaptic regulation. The potential site of this plasticity and its polarity remain unknown, but previous work shows LTP impairment in the DH.  Interestingly, we found that analgesic effect caused in SNI rats by activation of the DH was abolished by naloxone. Although it is likely that the µ-opioid receptor sensitivity of the DH-dependent analgesia is the result of activation of descending modulatory pathways, hippocampal plasticity itself is modulated by endogenous opioids,  and the 2 modulations are not mutually exclusive. \n\n\n### 4.4. Advantages and limitations \n  \nThe main strength of our study resides in the consistency of the results obtained using multiplicity of approaches, models, and species. Each of the 3 brain modulation techniques used has advantages and disadvantages; the major advantage of the pharmacological modulation is that it identifies molecular targets (the ligand receptors) that mediate the observed effects. A potential problem, however, is that different cell types (including glia) are simultaneously affected; in addition, it is unclear how much tissue was affected. Optogenetic stimulation is typically used to activate specific axon terminals. Here, we used it to excite local cell bodies; it may be argued that our optogenetic results share some of the same concerns as in the pharmacological approach. A critical advantage of our experimental design was   wireless   optogenetic stimulation to assess   real-time place   preference. This approach allows assessing rodents' behavior in more physiological conditions than the traditional fiber-implanted systems  and to determine the behavioral effects in real time. The chemo-fMRI approach is, to the best of our knowledge, the only one that allows the identification of changes in FC caused by selectively increasing excitability of a specific brain area. Thus, although each of our approaches has limitations, their combined use yielding convergent evidence imparts high confidence of main results. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nOver a decade ago, we launched human and rodent studies to link hippocampal processes with chronic pain based on the theoretical formulation that chronic pain may be envisioned as a state of extinction-resistant emotional learning.  Current results are consistent with this concept but only indirectly. Our primary conclusion is that the DH is deactivated with neuropathic pain, which unmasks DH control of both tactile allodynia and motivational/affective properties of neuropathic pain. Thus, the DH/PH should be considered a critical hub for novel treatment options for chronic pain. \n\n\n## Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. \n\n\n## Appendix A.

We employed a novel task potency approach which combines the unique aspects of both resting state fMRI and task-fMRI to quantify task-induced variations in the functional connectome.

Cross-participant heterogeneity in autism has made understanding underlying mechanisms and the complex interrelation between neurobiology and cognitive profiles in autism challenging. Imaging studies in autism report both over-and under-connectivity of functional brain networks [ – ] on the basis of resting state fMRI data.\nDifferent task-fMRI studies, probing a variety of neural processes, report between-group differences with small effect size at best [ – ]. Crucially, little effort has been made to integrate the diverse findings both across different cognitive domains and between task-fMRI and resting state connectivity at the level of an individual participant. In order to better characterize heterogeneity both across cognitive domains and across individuals, we combine novel methodological approaches. \n\nFirst, we propose an integrated analytical approach to characterize the task-specific cognitive demands in autistic individuals. We utilize a task potency approach which combines the unique aspects of both resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and task-fMRI [ ]. Rs-fMRI provides insight into the large-scale ‘architecture’ of brain connectivity in an individual. Task-fMRI might however more directly probe the neural correlates of specific cognitive domains affected by the condition such as social/emotional processing and attention. We leverage the advantages offered by both views in task potency, which disentangles the relative contribution of task-induced functional connectivity from that of the baseline architecture at the individual level [ ]. This allows for greater sensitivity to individual task-based functional connectivity (FC) effects as well as a more precise interpretation of findings as being related specifically to the cognitive load and not to differences in baseline. \n\nSecond, even though many cognitive/behavioral studies have been able to successfully show differences between individuals with autism and typically developing individuals across a range of cognitive domains such as social cognition, reward and emotion processing, and executive functioning [ ], there appears to exist pronounced behavioral, cognitive, and neural heterogeneity across individuals with autism [ – ]. In order to parse the heterogeneous nature of autism neurobiology, we therefore apply normative modeling which will allow us to map atypicality of brain-derived features on an individual basis with respect to the distribution of those features in a group of similar typically developing controls. [ ]. This approach has previously been applied in autism and yielded promising results [ – ]. This way, the analysis becomes more sensitive to idiosyncratic brain atypicalities. \n\nIn order to be able to characterize diversity in presentation across cognitive domains and individuals, we leverage the large-scale resource that has specifically been designed to capture a large, heterogenous and thus naturalistic autism sample—the EU-AIMS/AIMS-2-TRIALS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) [ – ]. It is designed to provide deep-phenotyping by including both various neuroimaging measures (such as rs-fMRI and task-fMRI), an extensive cognitive battery capturing social cognition, reward and emotion processing, and executive functioning and in-depth behavioral phenotyping. Due to the presence of multiple task paradigms in the dataset, we are able to contrast the spatial patterns of atypicality across these different tasks. We are especially interested in finding out whether posited patterns of task-specific functional connectome atypicality in autism are similar across cognitive domains—and conversely, how that similarity is expressed in typically developing controls. \n\nWe assess whether the patterns of brain atypicality we find in individuals relate to metrics of autism at a behavioral level—thereby assessing for each task whether task-specific functional connectome atypicality carries information relevant to finding brain-behavior relationships in autism. In order to relate high-dimensional brain data to behavioral data in a way without making prior assumptions on the most relevant features in a multivariate context, we will apply canonical correlation analysis (CCA) [ ,  ]. \n\nBy integrating complementary functional modalities and combining the aforementioned novel tools such as task potency and normative modelling, taking a unique look at identifying (a)typicality in the way individuals with autism engage with cognitive demands across tasks at the individual neural level is made possible. The multiple fMRI tasks present in the dataset enable a crucial cross-task perspective toward gauging to what extent such atypicalities exist across different cognitive loads, and whether this pattern is different in autism from typically developing controls. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Sample \n  \nThe dataset from the EU-AIMS/AIMS2TRIALS LEAP project was used for the current analyses—a large multi-center European project with an aim to identify biomarkers in [ – ]. Local ethical committees approved the study at their respective sites. Participant was extensively clinically phenotyped and underwent multiple MRI assessments. Data from participants with intellectual disability (IQ < 75) were not included in the current project. Furthermore, we removed participants from the analysis on the basis of data quality using the following criteria: Participants were required to have acceptable overlap (> 94%) with the MNI152 standard brain after image registration. We then excluded 57 participants due to poor overlap (< 50%) with one or more particular regions from the ICP brain parcellation atlas. In general, we followed the same rationale for brain region inclusion as used in [ ]. Participants were furthermore excluded on the basis of incidental findings and incomplete scans (  N   = 18), and those in the top 5% in terms of head motion quantified through root mean square framewise displacement (  N   = 27) [ ]. The above criteria resulted in the inclusion of data for analyses from the following participants: 282 participants with autism (age range 7.5–30.3 years; mean = 17.1; sd = 5.4; 72.3% male), and 221 typically developing controls (age range 6.9–29.8 years; mean = 17.0; sd = 5.5; 63.8% male). Not every participant was included in each analysis, for the reason that not all participants completed all fMRI scan sessions. See Additional file  : Tables S1 through S5 for more details on the subsample characterization in each task. \n\n\n### Behavioral data \n  \nTotal scores on seven behavioral variables were included in the multivariate canonical correlation analyses with the aim to broadly include information about the affected autism domains, co-occurring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and adaptive functioning, as well as IQ. Three variables cover the primary affected domains in autism (social and communicative difficulties, repetitive/restricted behaviors and interests, and sensory atypicalities): Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS) [ ]—a quantitative scale of autism symptomatology over the past 6 months, the Repetitive Behaviors Scale-revised (RBS) [ ]—a scale which assesses more specifically restricted and repetitive behaviors, and the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) [ ]—a scale which assesses sensory processing atypicalities. Two further variables cover the ADHD-related behaviors: ADHD hyperactivity/impulsivity, and ADHD inattentiveness. These are the two components from the DSM-5 ADHD rating scale for behavior in the past 6 months. Furthermore, we included the Vineland-II Adaptive Behavior Composite (Vineland) [ ] which assesses the level of real-life everyday adaptive functioning. Finally, we included Full scale intelligence quotient (IQ) as measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated scale intelligence-2 [ ]. Missing data were imputed with random forest regression, as done in [ ]. \n\n\n### fMRI data \n  \nParticipants performed a resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) lasting approximately 6 min, and one or more of the following task-fMRI scans: Hariri emotion processing (Hariri) [ ], Flanker and Go-NoGo (Flanker) [ ], social reward anticipation (Reward_s), nonsocial reward anticipation (Reward_ns) [ ], and animated shapes theory of mind (ToM) [ ,  ]. See Additional file   for brief descriptions of these tasks. Participants were instructed to relax and fixate on a cross presented on the screen for the duration of the rs-fMRI scan. Additionally, each participant completed an anatomical scan for the purpose of registration. MRI data were acquired on 3T scanners at multiple sites in Europe—King’s College London (KCL), Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (RUNMC), University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU), Autism Research Centre (ARC), University of Cambridge (UCAM), Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim (CIMH), and Karolinska Institutet (KI). Data from KI were not used due to a low number of participants. fMRI parameters are described in the supplementary information. \n\n\n### fMRI preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing of both the resting state- and task-fMRI data was performed with tools from FSL [ ]. The first five volumes for each acquisition were removed to allow for equilibration of the magnetization. To correct for head movement, we performed volume realignment to the middle volume using MCFLIRT. Next, global 4D mean intensity normalization and smoothing with a 6 mm FWHM kernel were applied. ICA-AROMA was used to identify and remove secondary motion-related artifacts [ ,  ]. Next, signal from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid was regressed out and we applied a 0.01 Hz high-pass filter. For each participant, we registered acquisitions to their respective high-resolution T1 anatomical images by means of the Boundary-Based Registration tool from FSL-FLIRT [ ]. The high-resolution T1 image belonging to each participant was registered to MNI152 space with FLIRT 12-degrees of freedom linear registration, and further refined using FNIRT nonlinear registration [ ]. We used the inverse of these transformations to take a brain atlas to the native space of each participant, where all further analyses were performed. ComBat was used to clean the data for linear site effects [ ]. This resulted in small changes to the functional connectivity matrices, see Additional file  : Fig. S4A-E. \n\n\n### Task potency \n  \nWe used the instantaneous connectivity parcellation (ICP) brain atlas with 168 brain regions (hierarchically situated in 11 larger-scale ’networks’) [ ] to define brain regions in the native space of each subject. The ICP parcellation was chosen for its suitability to FC modeling and due to its hierarchical nature. This was done for each of the five task-fMRI acquisitions—as well as for resting state. For each participant, we calculated the regularized covariance [ ] between the average BOLD time series extracted from each brain region pair. We then estimated partial correlations from the covariance matrix and consecutively applied the Fisher-Z transformation. This provided for each participant a connectivity matrix of size 168 × 168—one resting state matrix and one task-fMRI matrix per task. Mixture modeling offers an attractive way to analyze and model the noise in FC matrices without affecting reliable signal [ – ]. The main Gaussian from a mixture Gaussian-gamma model that was fitted on the distribution of edge values for each individual matrix supplied us with parameterized information about said distribution. We used these parameters to normalize the elements in each matrix by subtracting the main Gaussian mean and dividing by its standard deviation. In order to produce individual matrices of connectivity modulations induced by the task, i.e., task potency, we subtracted each participant’s resting state connectivity matrix from that participant’s task connectivity matrix. The resulting matrices are interpreted as containing the connectivity modulations away from the resting state baseline that the respective task induces in the brain—i.e., task potency [ ,  ]. \n\n\n### Normative modelling \n  \nA normative model of potency edge values was built against age and sex from typically developing participants using the nispat implementation in python [ ,  ]. This means that downstream analyses are also inherently corrected for age and sex. The model furthermore inherently models uncertainty that is present due to availability of datapoints in the age and sex distributions. The model was used to predict the range of (a)typical edge values in out-of-sample typically developing participants as well as the autistic participants. Task potency values were thereby transformed to Z-scores quantifying the atypicality per edge of each individual’s task potency matrix elements given the normative reference. This was done separately in each task. Participant mean   Z  -scores were not significantly related to participant scanner motion (FD), more details available in Additional file   (Fig. S3A–E). Percentage of connectome deemed atypical was identified by thresholding the   Z  -scores at   z   =|± 2.571|, nominally describing the 1% most extreme positive and negative values. The number of edges passing this threshold for each individual was then expressed as a percentage of the total amount of edges. Independent   t   tests were performed on the percentages to assess case–control differences in the tasks. All   p   values were FDR corrected for multiple comparisons across tasks. Cohen’s   D   was calculated for an effect size estimate in each task. \n\n\n### Cross-task similarity \n  \nWe investigate similarity in the patterns of atypicality across the tasks in autism as well as typically developing controls. This is done for both diagnostic groups separately by constructing a Pearson correlation matrix from the mean edgewise atypicality scores across tasks. Differences in covariance values are compared between the groups with the Wilcoxon signed rank test [ ]. \n\n\n### Canonical correlation analysis \n  \nCanonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding latent linear multivariate relationships between two sets of data [ – ]. CCA analysis was done only in the individuals with autism in order to assess whether the variation in the task atypicality patterns relates also to phenotypic description in individuals with autism. The following processing steps were done separately for each task. For the behavioral side of the CCA analysis, the seven variables previously described were used (SRS, RBS, SSP, ADHD hyperactivity/impulsivity, ADHD inattentiveness, Vineland, IQ). For the brain side of the CCA, principal components-based dimensionality reduction was applied to the brain subjects by edges data matrix in order to make the CCA well-posed. Aiming for a balance between model accuracy and complexity, the top 10 variance components were kept for input in the CCA. Stability and generalizability of CCA parameters was assessed through 1000 different splits of tenfold out-of-sample cross-validation—building a ‘test’ distribution of the first canonical correlation as well as the paired CCA weights. Significance of the relationship found was assessed through building an out-of-sample null distribution of CCA correlations, i.e., permutation testing. Subjects were randomly permuted (within scan site) to break up the original correlation structure and performing again 1000 different splits of tenfold cross-validation. Non-spuriousness of the original relationship found was assessed by assessing whether the mean of the test distribution is more extreme than the 95th percentile of the null distribution. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### General connectome atypicality levels \n  \nFigure   shows for each task distributions of subjects for the percentage of total edges that pass the atypicality threshold at 1% two tailed (  z   = 2.571) in the autism and TD groups. We interpret this metric as a global subject-level atypicality score in each task. We identify significantly greater levels of atypical modulation in individuals with autism in each of the tasks. Flanker—Cohen’s   d  : 0.61,   p   < 0.01. Hariri—  d  : 0.34,   p   < 0.01. Monetary reward—  d  : 0.19,   p   < 0.01. Social reward—  d  : 0.19,   p   < 0.01. Theory of mind—  d  : 0.36,   p   < 0.01. For full information see Additional file  : Table T1. These findings provide a global view where the distribution of edges in autism is shifted toward greater atypicality in achieving the same cognitive states as represented by task potency.   \nViolin plot of subject distributions for atypicality subject scores in each task.

(**  p   < 0.01, ***  p   < 0.001) \n  \n\n\n### Brain region atypicality levels \n  \nFor the next analysis, we looked more closely at the spatial profile of connectivity modulation atypicality of autistic individuals with respect to typically developing controls. Figure   shows for each task the top 10% brain regions with the greatest atypicality scores in the autism group. To further identify the implicated cognitive terms associated with these regions, we used the Neurosynth online brain image decoder (October, 2021) to identify which networks and cognitive terms were represented in the atypicality data spatial pattern [ ]. Because atypicality scores were initially estimated at the edge level, we computed the mean absolute atypicality value for all edges in a region, in order to present an atypicality score per brain region. For the Hariri task, the top matches were medial prefrontal cortex (  r   = 0.141), auditory (  r   = 0.132), and speech networks (  r   = 0.13), and superior temporal cortex (  r   = 0.119). In the Flanker task, the top matches between the pattern of atypicality and canonical brain networks were in order: medial prefrontal cortex (  r   = 0.144), default mode network (  r   = 0.12), and posterior cingulate (  r   = 0.11). For the monetary reward task, the top matches were again medial prefrontal cortex (  r   = 0.146), then somatosensory cortex (  r   = 0.116), default mode network (  r   = 0.115), and speech networks (  r   = 0.11). For the social reward task, the matches consisted of medial prefrontal cortex (  r   = 0.129), speech network (  r   = 0.11), and default mode network (  r   = 0.108). Finally, in the theory of mind task, the spatial pattern of atypical modulation was most closely matched to the speech network (  r   = 0.141), superior temporal cortex (  r   = 0.14), and auditory cortex (  r   = 0.139). The purely cognitive terms associated most with the atypicality scores were speech and listening/auditory regions across all tasks.   \nThe top 10% brain regions with the greatest atypicality score in autism as summed over edges. From top to bottom: Hariri, Flanker, social reward, nonsocial reward, and theory of mind \n  \n\n\n### Atypicality similarity across tasks \n  \nFigure   shows the correlation matrix of the atypicality edge pattern across the different tasks in the typically developing controls and autism groups. Correlations are consistently across tasks higher for autism (mean correlation: 0.43) than for TD (mean correlation 0.07). Wilcoxon signed rank test of the difference shows a significant difference at   p   < 0.002.   \nHeatmap of cross-task Pearson correlation of the edgewise group-level mean atypicality pattern in the brain for TD and ASD. Correlations are higher across the board for autism (mean correlation: 0.43), than for TD (mean correlation 0.07). Wilcoxon signed rank test shows a significant difference at   p   < 0.002 \n  \n\n\n### Canonical correlation analysis \n  \nWe then investigated whether these spatial patterns of atypicality in the different tasks are also meaningfully related to behavioral measures of autism, and how this may vary across tasks. This grounds the model into clinical relevance. Canonical correlation analyses found significant brain-behavior modes of covariation in each of the tasks. Loadings displayed very high stability under out-of-sample tenfold cross-validation (correlations > 0.99). Figure   displays CCA loadings in the behavioral domain for the respective tasks. Instead of revealing differential patterns for the different cognitive domains probed by the tasks, the patterns found are similar across tasks and load on to the behavioral variables in their respective direction of greater impairment. Because we include behavioral variables that form dimensional cornerstones of ASD diagnosis (SRS: social interaction, RBS: repetitive behavior, SSP: sensory atypicality), this suggest that our brain–behavior relationship follows a main positive–negative axis of autism impairment. The loadings are of comparable magnitude across the tasks with the exception of IQ, which does load in the modes revealed from the Hariri and Flanker tasks, but shows minimal involvement in (non)social reward and theory of mind. Figure   shows the top loading brain regions in the CCA. Figure   is effectively a rotation of the data from Fig.   under the added influence of autism behavioral scores. In this situation, for the Hariri task, the top Neurosynth matches were anterior cingulate cortex (  r   = 0.215), speech cortex (  r   = 0.143), and anterior insula (  r   = 0.134). For the Flanker task, these were temporal cortex (  r   = 0.152), language regions (  r   = 0.148), and superior temporal cortex (  r   = 0.148). In the monetary reward task, they were visual cortex (  r   = 0.185), occipital cortex (  r   = 0.177), and motor cortex (  r   = 0.162). In social reward, the best matches were prefrontal cortex (  r   = 0.135), linguistic regions (  r   = 0.132), and motor cortex (  r   = 0.132). Finally, for the theory of mind task, they consisted of dorsolateral cortex (  r   = 0.162), auditory cortex (  r   = 0.145), and anterior cingulate (  r   = 0.14).

From top to bottom: Hariri, Flanker, social reward, nonsocial reward, and theory of mind \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur aim in this study was to identify and map individual-level (a)typicality in neural patterns associated with processing across different cognitive domains. We employ a task potency approach (functional connectivity modulation away from resting state baseline) for individuals with autism as they engage in tasks with different cognitive demands. \n\nWe show that autism is paired with greater individual-level global atypicality of brain connectivity modulation in each of the tasks under review. This could indicate broadly atypical deployment of neural resources under cognitive loads in autism and reiterates the necessity to move beyond simple group comparisons through the normative modelling approach. We further show that the atypicalities we model in the brain relate to behavioral measures of autism and found a robust and stable primary relationship in each of the tasks. The behavioral loadings of this relationship can furthermore be interpreted as describing a main axis of impairment in autism. The relationship implies that the behavioral and fMRI data carry similar information. This means that our feature, consisting of atypical task modulation and which was developed independently of behavioral information, is nonetheless a descriptor of autism impairment as measured by behavioral testing. \n\nInterestingly, a large amount of the brain regions with the greatest atypicality scores were involved with language comprehension and language production, possibly pointing toward language networks being central to autism brain presentation. Furthermore, the spatial patterns of atypicality in the autism group display high levels of cross-task correlation, which was mostly absent in the typically developing controls. This suggests a high level of similar atypicality in autism when dealing with the various cognitive demands. Interestingly, these findings in combination would suggest that while individuals with autism have a globally more atypical pattern of task potency relative to controls, the specific spatial pattern of this atypicality does show clear similarity across cognitive domains. As far as these authors are aware, this is a novel finding and could support cognitive theories of autism involving a common deficit across mental domains. In the context of heterogeneous samples, it furthermore lends validity to the concept of an autism as a grouping from a functional neurobiological perspective. Research simultaneously investigating multiple tasks has previously been demonstrated in an ADHD cohort [ ], yet has not been applied to autistic individuals. Given our findings this could be a promising target for future research in autism. A deeper investigation of why and how it is the case that cross-task similarity in atypicalities are on average much more similar in autism than in controls, and how this might relate to literature of the lack of functional differentiation in autism [ ,  ] is necessary. One explanation could be that the brain connectivity pattern of individuals with autism is less free to fluctuate and reorganize under different cognitive loads. This explains both the atypicality in relationship to controls as well as the similarity across tasks within autism as found in this paper. \n\nThe findings in this paper need to be contextualized with regards to some limitations. Recent work in functional connectivity has highlighted the presence of test–retest variability in functional connectivity [ ,  ]. This variability can have different sources such as participant traits, time of day, level of caffeination, medication, and task-magnitude to name a few. This can set participants up toward different FC fingerprints in different such situations. In our research, we use every individual participant as their own baseline through task potency. In task potency, the participant task-scan is calibrated by using the participant resting state scan which was acquired during the same scan procedure. This offers an inherent method of controlling for some of these sources of variability. The brain plots displayed in this paper should not be regarded as directly equivalent to activation maps. While areas highlighted in the figures do imply involvement of said area, this involvement is through the up- or downregulation of its coupling with other areas—not necessarily its own activation in isolation. fMRI tasks used in the LEAP sample were chosen based on their relevance for autism research, however still other forms of cognitive engagement may be relevant for a complete cross-task perspective. Furthermore, though we view autism through individualized atypicality metrics, the normative range estimation necessitates that the typically developing participants are treated as a single group. This potentially masks subgroups in autism that are embedded in the typically developing range. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nTo conclude, in this paper, we have applied innovative techniques to aid understanding of autism brain connectivity heterogeneity in a multi-task setting. These techniques reveal that individuals with autism engage with tasks in a globally atypical way, but that the particular pattern of this atypicality is nevertheless similar across tasks. Atypicalities across tasks originate mostly from prefrontal cortex and default mode network regions, but also speech and auditory networks. We furthermore validated the behavioral relevance of these techniques through showing significant relationships between brain and behavioral data. The similarities between atypicalities across the affected cognitive domains in autism may hold the key to furthering our understanding of the autistic brain. Further, we demonstrated the added value of innovative tools, i.e., task potency and normative modelling, with the goal to improve the interpretability of task-based fMRI functional connectivity and parse heterogeneity at the individual level in autism. We show that individuals with autism exhibit an atypical task-active functional connectome and we show that taking a cross-task perspective might help reveal a common pattern of atypicality in autism more broadly. Further research may focus on applying advanced discriminative and/or clustering procedures on the novel brain features that we have shown to be relevant for autism in order to predict and/or subtype autism on the basis of FC measurements. Additionally, the current research may be expanded to tasks beyond the five we take under consideration, as well as to further neurodevelopmental conditions.\n \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"faae053d1d88ff7ac6525a36091301c8"},

Correlative analysis of PD between DC and FAB showed negative results (  p   < 0.05) in frontal cortex, whereas positive in insula and cerebellum. As for the correlations between DC and UPDRS-III, negative correlation (  p   < 0.05) was observed in bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and right cerebellum, whereas positive correlation (  p   < 0.05) in bilateral hippocampus and para-hippocampus gyrus (  p   < 0.01). \n\n Conclusion  : The altered global synchronizations revealed altered cognitive and movement functions in PD. The findings suggested that the global functional connectivity in fusiform gyrus, cerebellum and hippocampus gyrus are critical regions in the identification of cognitive and movement functions in PD. This study provides new insights on the interactions among global coordination of brain activity, cognitive and movement functions in PD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAs one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, people diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) are widely reported with abnormalities consisting of motor and non-motor symptoms (Chaudhuri et al.,  ; Bunzeck et al.,  ; Villarreal et al.,  ). PD is known as a kind of movement disorder, including general motor symptoms and specific motor symptoms (Fox et al.,  ). However, non-movement aspects such as impairment of cognitive and executive functions have also gained great attention and have been the topic of a great number of researches on PD (Kudlicka et al.,  ; Litvan et al.,  ; Dirnberger and Jahanshahi,  ; Delgado-Alvarado et al.,  ). Various methods are performed to explore the biomarkers for the diagnosis and progression monitoring of PD, including metabolomics profiling of blood (Bogdanov et al.,  ), cerebrospinal fluid (Hong et al.,  ), cognitive impairment (Svenningsson et al.,  ) and neuroimaging (Reijnders et al.,  ; Tessitore et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ). \n\nStructural and functional changes in patients with PD are observed in many neuroimaging studies (Borroni et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ; Prell,  ). Structural changes are reported in various brain regions such as corpus callosum, hippocampus, basal ganglia, temporal cortex and frontal cortex by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis (Camicioli et al.,  ; Summerfield et al.,  ; Wiltshire et al.,  ; Tessitore et al.,  ; Lee et al.,  ; Prell,  ). In recent years, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become a prevalent method to explore the alterations of spontaneous brain activities (Fox and Raichle,  ; Van Eimeren et al.,  ) in patients with PD. For the functional neuroimaging aspect, the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal is widely employed to explore the differences of spontaneous brain activity between healthy people and PD patients (Göttlich et al.,  ; Pan et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). Functional neuroimaging studies of PD are mainly focused on the spontaneous brain activity of amplitude of low frequency oscillations (Kwak et al.,  ; Hou et al.,  ; Pan et al.,  ), regional synchronization (Wu et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Pan et al.,  ) and functional connectivity (de Schipper et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). \n\nThe neuroimaging findings of PD are various and inconsistent. In the current stage, it is still unclear which structural or functional neuroimaging marker is reliable or convincing for understanding the pathological physiology of PD. While these findings suggest that the pathophysiological mechanisms in PD is complicated and assumed to a coordination of various brain regions. Degree centrality (DC), a voxel-wise measurement, is applied to evaluate the strengths of functional connectivity across the whole brain (Buckner et al.,  ). DC is a reliable rs-fMRI indicator (Zuo et al.,  ) and suggested to represent the global synchronizations or global functional connectivity density (Tomasi and Volkow,  ). Using the DC method, alterations are found in brain regions associated with cognition and motor, with these regions being depressed in PD sufferers (Wang et al.,  ). Higher degrees are observed in the precuneus in PD patients with cognitive impairments than patients without cognitive impairment (Nagano-Saito et al.,  ). In the current study, we applied DC to investigate the differences of global synchronizations of brain activity between PD and normal controls (NC). Furthermore, the neural correlations between global synchronizations and cognitive function as well as movement function were explored in PD group across the whole brain. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nIn this study, 35 NC and 35 patients diagnosed with PD were included in the investigation. Subjects of NC were included who had no history of neurological disease, no symptom of PD and no disorder of cognitive function and movement function. Diagnosis of PD was according to the clinical criteria of Movement Disorder Society (MDS; Postuma et al.,  ). PD patients included: those aged over 30 years old, no less than 1 year of disease duration, had received a stable dose of levodopa medication treatment for at least 30 days, without cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease, nor with a history of surgical operations or embedded with a pacemaker in the body. PD patients with severe symptoms of dementia, anxiety and depression were excluded. All of the PD patients were in a medication-on state during experimental data collection and no drug-naïve patient was included in this study. Both NC and PD subjects were recruited by Guangzhou First People’s Hospital from May 2017 to September 2018. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Guangzhou First People’s Hospital. Informed written consents were obtained from all subjects. \n\n\n### Clinical Assessments \n  \nClinical assessments, including motor and non-motor symptoms, were measured across all subjects with PD. Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) scale (Hoehn and Yahr,  ) was collected from subjects of PD group to evaluate the severity of PD symptoms, with classifications of stages 1–5, with a higher H&Y stage indicating an advanced state of PD. Additionally, cognitive function and motor function were also measured. For both NC and PD, cognitive-related measurement was identified by the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) containing six sub-items that are associated with the frontal cortex (Dubois et al.,  ). Movement-related assessment was evaluated from PD (medication-on) by the motor part (Part three) of Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III), which was developed by the MDS (Goetz et al.,  ). Higher UPDRS-III scores indicated decreased movement ability. \n\n\n### Data Acquisition \n  \nTwo groups of subjects (35 NC and 35 PD) participated in the MRI scanning by 3.0T SIEMENS MRI machine system. All of the subjects were required to lie quietly and stayed awake with eye closed during the whole process of scanning. All of the PD patients were in medication-on state when the fMRI was performed. Functional images and structural images of the brain were obtained. The resting-state functional images were obtained with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) of 2,000 ms, echo time (TE) of 21 ms, slice thickness of 4 mm, acquisition matrix of 64 × 64; flip angle (FA) of 78° and pixel spacing of 3.5 mm × 3.5 mm. Structural T1-weighted images were scanned with parameters: 1,900/2.22 ms TR/TE, acquisition matrix of 256 × 215, 9° FA, pixel spacing of 0.488 × 0.488 and 1 mm slice thickness. \n\n\n### Data Preprocessing \n  \nData preprocessing was implemented on MATLAB platform based on toolkit package of DPABI (Yan et al.,  ) and Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12 ). Preprocessing procedures included: removal of the first 10 of 220 time points; slice timing adjustment (33 slices); realign; segmentation using new segment (Ashburner and Friston,  ) and Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL; Ashburner,  ); regression of nuisance covariates including while matter, cerebrospinal fluid and Friston 24 parameters of head motions (Friston et al.,  ; Satterthwaite et al.,  ; Yan et al.,  ); spatial normalization with resampling of 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space by DARTEL (Ashburner,  ); temporal filtering with low frequency band pass of 0.01–0.1 Hz and linear detrend removal. Subjects with maximal translations exceeded 2.5 mm or rotations over 2.5° were excluded from analysis. According to this exclusion criteria, no subjects were excluded. Additionally, the mean framewise displacement (FD) Jenkinson (Jenkinson et al.,  ) was calculated, representing the head motions of every subject. No significant difference of FD Jenkinson between two groups was observed by two-sample   t  -test (  p   = 0.1294). \n\n\n### Global Signal Synchronization—Degree Centrality \n  \nDC is a voxel-wise measurement calculating the functional connectivity density between a voxel with the other voxels within the mask (Buckner et al.,  ). Pearson correlation is employed to evaluate the connectivity strength of all pairs of voxels. DC is conventionally calculated as weighted-sum DC or binarized-sum DC. The weighted-sum DC is defined as summing up the correlation coefficients that reach a given threshold, whereas the binarized-sum DC is defined as summing up the number of correlation coefficient that reaches a given threshold. Therefore, DC is also named global functional connectivity density, long range functional connectivity and global signal synchronization (Tomasi and Volkow,  ). In this study, based on the preprocessed functional image, binarized-sum DC was calculated and the threshold was set at 0.3. For standardization, the DC maps of all subjects were transformed into Z-maps by subtracting the global mean value and then divided by standard deviation. After standardization transformation, the Z-maps were then smoothed with 4 mm of full width at half maximum (FWHM). The smoothed Z-maps were applied to the subsequent statistical analysis and correlative analysis. \n\n\n### Statistical and Correlative Analysis \n  \nTo explore global signal synchronization differences between NC and PD, a two-sample   t  -test was performed on DC maps of two groups, with age, sex, education time and mean FD Jenkinson as covariates within the mask of gray matter. The resultant statistical T-map was corrected with multiple comparisons of Gaussian Random Field (GRF) within gray matter mask, with voxel   p   < 0.005 and cluster   p   < 0.05, two-tailed test (  T   > 2.91, cluster size > 1,350 mm ). \n\nThe brain regions showing significant group differences were extracted as regions of interest (ROIs) to explore the neural correlates between global signal synchronization (DC) and cognitive function (FAB) as well as movement function (UPDRS-III). DC signals were extracted from ROIs by averaging the signals of all voxels within ROI. Pearson correlation (statistical significance level   p   < 0.05) was applied to calculate the correlations between DC and cognitive/movement function. Moreover, the correlation analysis was also analyzed across the whole brain, within Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template, which contains 116 brain regions, including 90 cerebrum regions and 26 cerebellum regions (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic Characteristics and Clinical Assessments \n  \nStatistical results of demographic characteristics and clinical measurements were summarized in  . No group difference (  p   > 0.05) was observed on age or mean FD Jenkinson. Significant group differences were demonstrated in FAB scores (  p   < 0.0001) and education time (  p   = 0.0277). NC were shown to have higher FAB scores and longer education time than PD ( ). It should be noted that the FAB scores were obtained from 31 out of 35 PD patients because four PD patients refused to do the FAB assessment. \n  \nDemographic characteristics and clinical assessments. \n  \n NC, normal controls; PD, Parkinson’s disease; FD, framewise displacement of Jenkinson; H&Y, Hoehn & Yahr; UPDRS-III, Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (part three); FAB, Frontal assessment battery; NA, not applicable.

The correlative analysis between DC and cognitive/movement functions was performed within these brain regions. Positive correlation was observed between DC and UPDRS-III in left fusiform gyrus (  r   = 0.41,   p   = 0.0145;  ), while no correlation (  p   > 0.05) was observed between DC and FAB scores. Additionally, the neural correlations of cognitive function (FAB) and movement function (UPDRS-III) were examined across the whole brain within AAL templates. The significant results were demonstrated in  – . \n  \nSignificant correlations between cognitive function and the global signal synchronizations within the whole brain [Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) templates] in patients with PD.   (A)   The Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) scores of NC and PD.

The dots and lines were demonstrated in red/blue color for positive/negative correlations. \n  \nAmong the correlative analysis between DC and FAB scores in PD, negative correlations were observed in bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG;  ) and right medial SFG ( ). The results were shown to be positive in bilateral insula ( ), bilateral cerebellum-crus1 ( ) and right cerebellum-6 ( ). The results were insignificant (  p   > 0.05) in NC within these regions. Conversely, significant negative results (  p   < 0.05) were observed in the bilateral hippocampus in NC, while the results were unobvious (  p   > 0.05) in PD ( ). \n\nSignificant correlative analysis between DC and movement function (UPDRS-III) of PD within AAL templates are demonstrated in  . Negative correlations were observed in bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL;  ), right AG ( ), and right cerebellum-6 ( ). DC were positively correlated with UPDRS-III in the bilateral hippocampus ( ) and para-hippocampus gyrus ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, the indicator of DC was adopted to compare the difference of global signal synchronizations of spontaneous brain activity between PD and NC. In addition, the neural correlations between global synchronizations and cognitive/movement functions were explored across the whole brain within AAL templates. Significant results were observed in both analysis of group DC differences and neural correlations. \n\n### More Sticky to Default Mode State in Parkinson’s Disease \n  \nSignificant DC differences between PD and DC were observed in left fusiform gyrus extending to ITG, left MTG/angular gyrus and right IFGoper/STG ( ,  ). Posterior MTG and angular gyrus, together with medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCu/PCC), are identified as critical brain regions that constitute default mode network (DMN; Raichle et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ). Brain activities in DMN are task-negative, which means deactivations during task-related state and activations in resting state (Raichle et al.,  ). DMN is also thought to be associated with self-referential processing (de Groot et al.,  ; Gusnard and Raichle,  ). In our results, increased DC was demonstrated in left MTG and angular gyrus compared to in the NC group in a resting state. Dysfunctional DMN was also reported in other neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia (Calhoun et al.,  ) and Alzheimer’s disease (Lustig et al.,  ). Additionally, less deactivations of DMN in PD were also observed in executive tasks than those in NC (Van Eimeren et al.,  ). DC evaluates global synchronizations and global functional connectivity density, therefore, higher DC activities indicate higher binding between inter-regions collaboration. Therefore, higher global synchronizations of DMN in PD may result in decreased ability to be self-referential, more likely to remain the default mode state and less control of interactions between brain regions. \n\nCognitive impairment is commonly present in PD patients. A VBM study on PD reports gray matter atrophy in left fusiform gyrus, and the fusiform atrophy is associated with poor memory (Camicioli et al.,  ). Fusiform gyrus is famous for its face area and face perception (Kanwisher et al.,  ; George et al.,  ). PD patients have an impairment in recognizing facial expression and visuospatial dysfunctions (Levin et al.,  ; Sprengelmeyer et al.,  ). In our results, increased DC was also observed in left fusiform gyrus and the DC in the fusiform is positively correlated with movement function for PD patients ( ,  ). Consistent with previous study, increased activity is shown in the fusiform gyrus in response to the paradigm of facial perception (Cardoso et al.,  ). Visuospatial dysfunctions have an impact on the movement of PD especially those with freezing gait. The correlation between DC in fusiform gyrus and movement function may be explained by impaired vision in balance (Day and Guerraz,  ). \n\n\n### Neural Correlations of Cognitive and Movement Function in Parkinson’s Disease \n  \nPatients with PD are not only reported with abnormalities of motor symptoms but also with decreased cognitive function (Dubois and Pillon,  ; Kehagia et al.,  ). As expected, the FAB scores of PD were significantly lower than NC (  p   < 0.0001;  ), suggesting decreased frontal-related of cognitive function in PD. The correlative analysis between global synchronizations and cognitive function scores across the whole brain showed significant correlations in frontal cortex, insula and cerebellum in PD patients ( ), while there was no significant result in NC. The DC of PD was negatively correlated with FAB scores in bilateral SFG and medial SFG, and positively correlated with bilateral insula and cerebellum. The frontal cortex is always associated with cognitive and executive functions (Miller and Cohen,  ). Cortical thickness changes and gray matter volume reductions were reported in frontal cortex of PD (Pan et al.,  ; Tessitore et al.,  ). Therefore, negative correlations between DC and FAB scores reveal altered frontal-cognitive function in PD. \n\nContrary to frontal cortex, the correlations between DC and FAB scores were positive in the insula ( ). Though the insula is a well-known brain region that is associated with self-representation (Burgmer et al.,  ) and awareness (Craig,  ), it is also suggested to be related to non-motor symptoms of PD (Christopher et al.,  ). In addition, patients with PD were observed with reduced gray matter volume in insula (Pan et al.,  ) and decreased DC in bilateral insula in medication-off state (Zhong et al.,  ). Insular dysfunction is also related to PD with cognitive impairment (Christopher et al.,  ). These findings suggest higher DC in insula of PD suggests higher cognitive function. \n\nPositive correlations between DC and FAB scores were also shown in the cerebellum ( ). However, negative correlations were observed between DC and movement function (UPDRS-III) in PD ( ). Cerebellum is both associated with sensorimotor processing (Baumann et al.,  ; Kansal et al.,  ) and cognitive/emotional processing (Schmahmann,  ; Adamaszek et al.,  ). Decreased DC in cerebellum-6 was also observed in PD (Wang et al.,  ). Positive results in neural correlations of cognitive function and negative neural correlations of movement function were found in the cerebellum, suggesting that the cerebellum plays both cognitive and motor function roles in the pathology of PD. \n\nThe hippocampus is well known for its role in memory (Squire,  ). Interestingly, negative correlations were observed between DC and FAB scores in the hippocampus of NC, while no correlation was observed (  p   > 0.05) in PD ( ). Moreover, positive correlations were shown between DC and movement function (UPDRS-III) in the hippocampus/para-hippocampus in PD ( ). These findings seem to suggest that the global synchronizations in the hippocampus reveal both cognitive and movement functions of PD. Hippocampus atrophy is found in PD patients with depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment and dementia (van Mierlo et al.,  ; Delgado-Alvarado et al.,  ). A longitudinal study on PD patients suggests that the hippocampus is related to the progression of cognitive impairment and dementia (Kandiah et al.,  ). Decoupled correlation between hippocampal DC and FAB scores of PD ( ) may imply cognitive decline in PD. The findings of PD studies in reference to hippocampus/para-hippocampus are extensively focused on non-motor symptoms, mostly on depression, cognitive decline and memory impairment, and are rarely related to motor symptoms or movement function. The hippocampus is involved in motor tasks and perturbed movements (Devan et al.,  ; Kerr et al.,  ) which are not general movements. No direct evidence supports the influence of hippocampus on motor effect in PD. Our finding of increased hippocampal signal synchronization comes with increased motor performance in PD ( ) suggests that the hippocampus has an important role in the motor symptoms of PD. \n\nIn our results, negative correlations between DC and movement function (UPDRS-III) were observed in bilateral IPL ( ). Altered brain activities of parietal lobe are widely reported in PD studies. Decreased inter-hemispheric functional connectivity in IPL was demonstrated in PD and negative neural correlation was observed in interaction with motor scores (Li et al.,  ). Meta-analysis also suggests that IPL is a robust brain region that showed significant differences in regional synchronizations between PD and NC (Pan et al.,  ). Therefore, IPL may be a critical brain region in the motor symptom of PD. \n\nThe findings of this study suggest the global synchronizations of the fusiform, hippocampus and cerebellum-6 are critical brain regions for both cognitive function and movement function of PD. However, the exact pathology remains unclear and needs further studies on it. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nAlterations of global synchronization in the left fusiform gyrus and right opercular-frontal cortex reveal altered cognitive and movement functions in PD. The findings of neural correlations suggest that the global functional connectivity in fusiform gyrus, cerebellum and hippocampus are critical in the identification of cognitive and movement functions in PD. This study provides new insights on the interaction among global coordination of brain activity, cognitive function and movement function in PD. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Guangzhou First People’s Hospital.

Inter-regional synchrony of resting-state brain activity averaged over several minutes (i.e., time-averaged static functional connectivity) has informed our understanding of brain network organization , individual differences in behavior , and mental disorders . Recent studies have shown that additional important insights can be gained from studying moment-to-moment variation in inter-regional synchrony, i.e., time-varying dynamic functional connectivity . However, it is currently unclear how spatial heterogeneity in local circuit properties contributes to both time-averaged and time-varying properties of large-scale brain dynamics. \n\nLarge-scale spontaneous brain activity is thought to arise from the reverberation of intrinsic dynamics of local circuits interacting across long-range anatomical connections . Simulations of large-scale biophysically plausible models of coupled brain regions have provided mechanistic insights into spontaneous brain activity . However, most previous large-scale circuit models assumed that local circuit properties (e.g., local synaptic strength, etc.) are identical across brain regions, which is not biologically plausible. Recent studies in both humans and macaques  have demonstrated that allowing local circuit properties to vary along the brain’s hierarchical axis yielded significantly more realistic static functional connectivity (FC). However, these heterogeneous models have not been shown to recapitulate time-varying FC dynamics. \n\nIn this study, we developed a spatially heterogeneous mean-field model (MFM) to realistically capture time-varying FC dynamics. Local circuit heterogeneity can be informed by in-vivo structural and functional neuroimaging measures. For example, T1-weighted/T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) MRI estimates of intracortical myelin and the principal resting-state FC gradient have been shown to index anatomical  and functional  hierarchies, respectively. Parameterization of local circuit properties with T1w/T2w maps led to more realistic static FC than a spatially homogeneous mean-field model . However, local circuit properties might be more strongly associated with the principal FC gradient than the T1w/T2w map . Thus, we hypothesized that parameterizing local circuit properties with both the T1w/T2w map and the principal FC gradient might lead to a more realistic computational model, which we will refer to as the parametric mean-field model (pMFM). Using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we demonstrated that pMFM achieved markedly more realistic static FC and FC dynamics in new out-of-sample participants. \n\nBoth empirical and pMFM-simulated FC dynamics demonstrated remarkably similar sharp transitions in FC patterns, suggesting the existence of multiple FC states or attractors. Previous studies have suggested that multi-stability in nonlinear brain systems might arise from noise-driven transitions between dynamic states or attractors . These noise-driven transitions might be reflected in the amplitude of regional brain activity. Therefore, we further investigated the relationship between the amplitude of regional fMRI signals and transitions in functional connectivity dynamics in both empirical and pMFM-simulated data. We also performed causal perturbations of the large-scale circuit model to better understand the origins of FC multi-stability. Finally, the amplitude of regional fMRI signals has been linked with the gene expression markers of parvalbumin (PVALB) and somatostatin (SST) inhibitory interneurons , in line with rodent studies suggesting that differential interneuron abundance may underlie regional variability in local cortical function . Thus, we also investigated the spatial relationship among FC dynamics, fMRI signal amplitude, and gene expression patterns from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). \n\nThe contributions of this study are multi-fold. First, we showed that heterogeneous local circuit properties, parameterized by both anatomical and functional gradients, are important for generating realistic models of static FC and FC dynamics. Second, in both pMFM simulations and empirical fMRI data, the regional fMRI amplitude of sensory-motor regions tracked state transitions in FCD. Causal perturbations of the pMFM provided further evidence that sensory-motor regions might be drivers of FCD. Finally, the spatial distribution of sensory-motor drivers appeared to match the differential expression of PVALB and SST, as well as the first principal component of brain-specific genes. Overall, this suggests a potential link between FC dynamics and heterogeneity in excitation/inhibition balance across the cortex. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Optimization of the parametric mean-field model (pMFM) \n  \n1052 participants from the HCP S1200 release were randomly divided into training (  N   = 351), validation (  N   = 350), and test (  N   = 351) sets. The Desikan–Killiany anatomical parcellation  with 68 cortical regions of interest (ROIs) was used to generate group-averaged structural connectivity (SC) and static functional connectivity (FC) matrices from the training, validation, and test sets separately. Analyses with a functional parcellation yielded similar conclusions (see “Control analyses” section). For each rs-fMRI run, time-varying functional connectivity was computed using the sliding window approach . Briefly, for each rs-fMRI run, a 68 × 68 FC matrix was computed for each of 1118 sliding windows. Each window comprised 83 time points (or 59.76 s). The 68 × 68 FC matrices were then correlated across the windows, yielding a 1118 × 1118 functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) matrix for each run . \n\nThe dynamic mean-field model (MFM) was used to simulate neural dynamics of the 68 cortical ROIs . Based on the simulated neural activity at each ROI, the hemodynamic model  was then used to simulate blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI. Details of the model can be found in the Methods section. Here we highlight the intuitions behind the MFM. In the MFM, the neural dynamics of each ROI are driven by four components: (1) recurrent (intra-regional) input, (2) inter-regional inputs, (3) external input (potentially from subcortical relays), and (4) neuronal noise. There are “free” parameters associated with each component. First, a larger recurrent connection strength   corresponds to a stronger recurrent input current. Second, the inter-regional inputs depend on the neural activities of other cortical ROIs and the connectional strength between ROIs. The inter-regional connectional strength is parameterized by the SC matrices, scaled by a global scaling constant  . Third,   is the external input current. Fourth, the neuronal noise is assumed to be Gaussian with a standard deviation  . \n\nIn the current study, the recurrent connectional strength  , external input current   I  , and noise amplitude   are each parameterized as a linear combination of the principal resting-state FC gradient  and T1w/T2w myelin estimate , resulting in 10 unknown linear coefficients. Both FC gradient and T1w/T2w map were estimated from the training set. We refer to the resulting model as parametric MFM (pMFM). The 10 unknown linear coefficients were automatically estimated by minimizing disagreement between the empirical and simulated BOLD signal (Fig.  ).    Schematic of parametric mean-field model (pMFM) optimization.  \n A   The pMFM comprised ordinary differential equations (ODEs) at each cortical region coupled by a structural connectivity (SC) matrix. The circuit-level parameters were allowed to vary across cortical regions, parameterized by a linear combination of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) gradient and T1w/T2w spatial maps. The pMFM was used to generate simulated static FC and functional connectivity dynamics (FCD). The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) was used to estimate the pMFM by minimizing a cost function of disagreement with empirically observed FC and FCD.   B   The CMA-ES algorithm was applied to the Human Connectome Project (HCP) training set (  N   = 351) to generate 5000 candidate parameter sets. The top 10 candidate parameter sets were then selected from the 5000 candidate sets based on the model fit in the validation set (  N   = 350). Finally, these top 10 candidate sets were evaluated in the HCP test set (  N   = 351). Comparison of the pMFM with other parametrizations (Fig.   and Supplementary Fig.  ) utilized the same training-validation-test procedure. \n  \n\nMore specifically, the simulated fMRI was used to compute a 68 × 68 static FC matrix and a 1118 × 1118 FCD matrix. The agreement between the simulated and empirical static FC matrices was defined as the Pearson’s correlation (  r  ) between the   z  -transformed upper triangular entries of the two matrices. Larger   r   indicated more similar static FC. The disagreement between the simulated and empirical FCD matrices was defined as the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) distance between the upper triangular entries of the two matrices . A smaller KS distance indicated a more similar FCD. To optimize both static FC and FCD, an overall cost was defined as (1 −   r  ) + KS and minimized in the training set. We considered three different minimization algorithms, each generating 5000 candidate sets of model parameters from the training set. Covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES ) performed the best in the validation set (Supplementary Fig.  ), so the 10 best CMA-ES parameter sets from the validation set were evaluated in the test set. The pMFM was compared with other parametrizations using the same training-validation-test procedure. \n\n\n### The pMFM yielded highly realistic functional connectivity dynamics \n  \nFigure   shows a representative empirical FCD from a participant in the test set. Figure   shows a simulated FCD generated by the pMFM using the best model parameters (from the validation set) using SC from the test set. Both empirical and simulated FCD exhibited red off-diagonal blocks representing recurring FC patterns. Across the 10 best candidate sets from the validation set, KS distance between empirical and simulated FCD was 0.12 ± 0.03 (mean ± std) in the test set.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. \n  \n\nAcross the 10 best candidate sets from the validation set, correlation between empirical and simulated static FC was 0.66 ± 0.03 in the test set. As a reference, the correlation between SC and static FC in the test set was 0.28. Figure   shows the correlation between empirical and pMFM-simulated static FC obtained from applying the best model parameters from the validation set to SC from the test set. \n\nFigure   shows the simulated FCD using the MFM parameters from our previous study . The almost constant values in off-diagonal elements suggest a lack of realistic FC dynamics. KS distance between empirical and simulated FCD was 0.88. Correlation between static empirical and simulated static FC was 0.48. Thus, the pMFM was able to generate much more realistic static FC and FCD than the MFM . \n\n\n### Combining anatomical and functional gradients generated more realistic brain dynamics \n  \nIn the previous section, we demonstrated that pMFM was able to generate realistic static FC and FCD. To explore what aspects of pMFM are important for generating realistic static FC and FCD, we performed a number of control analyses. First, we investigated the importance of utilizing both anatomical and functional gradients in generating realistic static FC and FCD. Most large-scale circuit model studies assume spatially homogeneous parameters. When recurrent connectional strength  , external input current   and noise amplitude   were optimized by CMA-ES, but constrained to be spatially homogeneous (Fig.  ), there was a substantially weaker agreement with empirical static FC (  r   = 0.55 ± 0.05) and FCD (KS = 0.50 ± 0.31) in the test set. Similarly, spatial heterogeneity for all three parameters ( ,  , and  ) were necessary to generate the most realistic static FC and FCD in the test set (Supplementary Fig.  – ).    Importance of multiple spatial gradients for generating realistic static functional connectivity (FC) and functional connectivity dynamics (FCD).  \n A   Simulated FCD from a mean-field model (MFM) optimized using the same algorithm as pMFM, but with model parameters constrained to be the same across cortical regions.   B   Agreement between empirically observed and simulated static FC from MFM optimized using the same algorithm as pMFM, but with model parameters constrained to be the same across cortical regions.   C   Agreement (Pearson’s correlation) between simulated and empirically observed static FC, as well as disagreement (KS distance) between simulated and empirically observed FCD across different conditions in the test set. Each boxplot comprises 10 correlation values (left) or 10 KS statistic (right) based on the 10 best candidate sets from the validation set. The boxes show the inter-quartile range (IQR) and the median. Whiskers indicate 1.5 IQR. Black crosses represent outliers. The pMFM utilizing both anatomical and functional gradients (FC gradient and T1w/T2w spatial maps) performed the best, suggesting that T1w/T2w and FC gradient provided complementary contributions. * indicates statistical significance after correcting for multiple comparisons with a false discovery rate (FDR) of   q   < 0.05. All   p   values are reported in Supplementary Table  . Source data are provided as a Source Data file. \n  \n\nSecond, if recurrent connectional strength  , external input current   and noise amplitude   were parameterized with only T1w/T2w  or only FC gradient, then the resulting static FC and FCD were less realistic in the test set (Fig.  ). Furthermore, if recurrent connectional strength  , external input current   and noise amplitude   were allowed to be spatially heterogeneous across brain regions, but not constrained by T1w/T2w or FC gradient (i.e., non-parametric), then simulations could achieve realistic static FC, but not FCD in the test set (Supplementary Fig.  ). One reason could be the large number of “free” parameters leading to overfitting in the training set. \n\nSupplementary Table   provides summary statistics of the two metrics (FC correlation and FCD KS statistic) in the training, validation, and test sets. The pMFM was statistically better than the spatially homogeneous MFM for both metrics in the test set. Compared with other alternative parameterizations, pMFM was statistically better in one metric and statistically comparable in the other metric. \n\nFinally, instead of fitting to both static FC and FCD in the training set, we also tried fitting only to static FC. Not surprisingly, the resulting model yielded unrealistic functional connectivity dynamics (Supplementary Fig.  ; KS = 0.88 ± 0.01). On the other hand, correlation between static empirical and simulated static FC was 0.73 ± 0.01, which was only slightly better than when optimizing both static FC and FCD (Fig.  ). This suggests that the goals of generating realistic static FC and FCD were not necessarily contradictory. \n\nOverall, these results suggest the importance of parameterizing recurrent connectional strength  , external input current   and noise amplitude   with spatial gradients that smoothly varied from sensory-motor to association cortex. Furthermore, T1w/T2w and FC gradient are complementary in the sense that combining the two spatial maps led to more realistic static FC and FCD (Fig.  ). \n\n\n### Technical considerations and interpretations \n  \nIt is worth emphasizing that the different parameterizations were compared with the same training-validation-testing procedure (Fig.  ), which automatically controls for model complexity or degrees of freedom. A more complex model will generally fit the training data better but might not perform well in the test set. For example, when recurrent connectional strength  , external input current   and noise amplitude   were allowed to be spatially heterogeneous across brain regions, but not constrained by T1w/T2w or FC gradient (i.e., non-parametric), then simulations could achieve realistic static FC, but not FCD in test set (Supplementary Table  ). This is an example, where a more flexible model (205 free parameters) yielded an excellent fit in the training and validation sets but a significantly worse fit in the test set. \n\nIn all the previous analyses, the overall cost was defined as (1 −   r  ) + KS, which placed equal weights on fitting FC and FCD. When the relative weights of FC and FCD were altered, combining both T1w/T2w map and FC gradient still yielded better test set performance than either T1w/T2w map or FC gradient alone (Supplementary Fig.  ). Although the original analysis (Fig.  ) suggested that T1w/T2 map explained FCD better than FC gradient, this was no longer the case when the relative weights were altered (Supplementary Fig.  ). On the other hand, FC gradient was better than T1w/T2w map at explaining static FC across the three experiments (Figs.   and Supplementary Fig.  ), which made intuitive sense given that FC gradient was derived from static FC. However, we note that the analyses were not circular given that the FC gradient was derived from the training set and performance was evaluated on the test set. \n\n\n### Opposite gradient directions in recurrent connection strength, noise amplitude, and external input \n  \nFigure  B–  illustrates the spatial distribution of recurrent connection strength  , external input current  , and noise amplitude   based on the best parameter estimate from the validation set. The black lines indicate seven resting-state network boundaries (Fig.  A ). While the resting-state network boundaries do not exactly align with the anatomically defined parcels, there was a striking correspondence between the resting-state networks and estimated pMFM parameters. Given the parameterization of pMFM by a linear combination of FC gradient  and T1w/T2w spatial maps , it was not surprising that the parameter estimates exhibited a hierarchical gradient of values monotonically changing from sensory-motor to association networks (right column of Fig.  B– ).    Spatial distribution of recurrent connection strength  , external input current  , and noise amplitude  , and their relationships with resting-state networks.  \n A   Seven resting-state networks .   B   Strength of recurrent connection   in 68 Desikan–Killiany cortical ROIs (left) and seven resting-state networks (right).   C   Strength of external input   in 68 Desikan–Killiany cortical ROIs (left) and seven resting-state networks (right).   D   Strength of noise amplitude   in 68 Desikan–Killiany cortical ROIs (left) and seven resting-state networks (right). The boxplots comprised values obtained by “transferring” the parameter estimates from the 68 Desikan–Killiany parcels to all vertices (from the underlying cortical meshes) comprising each anatomical parcel. The vertex wise parameter values were then segregated based on the seven resting-state networks. Therefore, there were 3203, 2478, 1523, 1520, 1067, 1438, and 2886 values comprising the boxplots for somatomotor, visual, dorsal attention, ventral attention, limbic, control, and default networks, respectively. The boxes show the inter-quartile range (IQR) and the median. Whiskers indicate 1.5 IQR. Black crosses represent outliers. Recurrent connection strength and noise amplitude increased from sensory-motor to association (limbic, control, and default) networks. On the other hand, external input current was the highest in sensory-motor networks and decreased towards the default network. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. \n  \n\nHowever, the gradient directions were different across the three parameters. In particular, both recurrent connection strength and noise amplitude appeared to increase from sensory-motor to association (limbic, control, and default) networks. On the other hand, external input current was the highest in sensory-motor networks and decreased towards the default network. The directionalities of noise amplitude and external input current were consistent across all the top ten parameter estimates from the validation set. In the case of recurrent connection strength, one of the ten parameter sets exhibited the opposite direction (i.e., decrease from sensory-motor regions to association networks; Supplementary Fig.  ), suggesting potential degeneracy in the case of recurrent connection strength. \n\nThe previous analysis was “biased” to find degeneracy given that the top 10 parameter sets were selected to ensure diversity (see “Methods” section). To further explore the degeneracy issue, the recurrent connection strength map of the top parameter set (from the validation set) was correlated with the recurrent connection strength maps of the remaining 4999 candidate parameter sets (Supplementary Fig.  ). In general, parameter sets with good validation cost were strongly correlated with the top parameter estimate from the validation set. Similar conclusions were obtained for external input and noise amplitude, although external input appeared to be less stable than recurrent connection strength and noise amplitude. \n\n\n### Time-varying amplitude of regional fMRI time courses tracks time-varying functional connectivity \n  \nGiven that the pMFM was able to generate realistic FCD, we now seek to use the pMFM to provide further insights into mechanisms underlying FCD. Previous studies have suggested that FCD might arise from switching between multi-stable states . Indeed, a magnified portion of the FCD matrix from a HCP test participant (Fig.  ) suggests the presence of at least two distinct states. In one state (white asterisk in Fig.  ), the sliding window FC pattern appeared to be coherent over a time period. In a second state (black asterisk in Fig.  ), the sliding window FC patterns were incoherent over another time period, so the high correlations within the block were restricted to the diagonals, and likely driven by autocorrelation in the fMRI signals and overlapping sliding windows. We hypothesized that fMRI signals might be dominated by large coherent amplitude fluctuations during the coherent state and dominated by noise during the incoherent state (right panel in Fig.  ; see ref.   for a review of multi-stability). If our hypothesis were true, we would expect large regional fMRI signal amplitude during the coherent state and small regional fMRI signal amplitude during the incoherent state.    Correspondence between functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) and time-varying amplitude of regional fMRI time courses.  \n A   Inspection of FCD from a HCP test participant suggests at least two states. The first state (white asterisk) exhibits coherent FC patterns over a period of time. The second state (black asterisk) exhibits incoherent FC patterns over a period of time. The right panel illustrates our hypothesis that the coherent state might be characterized by large coherent amplitude in regional fMRI signals, i.e., high standard deviation (STD), while the incoherent state might be characterized by noise in regional fMRI signals, i.e., low standard deviation (STD).   B   Top panel shows empirical FCD matrix of a HCP test participant. The middle panel shows the FCD mean time course obtained by averaging the rows of the FCD matrix from the top panel. The bottom panel shows the standard deviation of each regional fMRI time course within each sliding window (SW-STD). The color of the lines corresponds to the correlation between the first derivative of the FCD mean time course and the first derivative of the SW-STD time courses. Sharp transitions in SW-STD corresponded to sharp FCD transitions (red dashed lines).   C   Same as   B  , but simulated from pMFM using the best model parameters from the validation set and structural connectivity from the test set.   D   SW-STD during coherent (high FCD mean) and incoherent (low FCD mean) states. Boxplots illustrate the variation across HCP test participants. Coherent states were characterized by large amplitude (STD) in fMRI signals (  p   = 2.4e−168). The   p  -value was computed from a two-sided   t  -test and survived the false discovery rate (  q   < 0.05).   E   Same as   D  , but simulated from pMFM. There are 349 and 1000 independent samples for the boxplots in   D   and   E  , respectively. The boxes show the inter-quartile range (IQR) and the median. Whiskers indicate 1.5 IQR. Red crosses represent outliers. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. \n  \n\nTo test our hypothesis, the standard deviation of the average fMRI signal of each cortical ROI within each sliding window was computed. Figure   (top panel) shows the FCD matrix of a single participant from the HCP test set. Figure   (top panel) shows the simulated FCD matrix from the pMFM using the best model parameters from the validation set and structural connectivity (SC) from the test set. The middle panels of Fig.   show the FCD mean time course obtained by averaging the rows of the FCD matrices from the top panels. Sharp transitions in the FCD mean time course reflected sharp transitions in the FCD matrix. The bottom panel shows the sliding window standard deviation (SW-STD) of empirical and simulated fMRI signals. There was striking correspondence between sharp transitions in the FCD mean time course and SW-STD time courses in both empirical and simulated data (red dashed lines in Fig.  ). \n\nConsistent with our hypothesis, there was a large signal amplitude during the coherent state and low signal amplitude during the incoherent state (Fig.  ). To quantify this phenomenon, for each run of each participant in the HCP test set, we fitted a mixture of two Gaussian distributions to the histogram of the FCD mean . The cross-over point of the two Gaussian distributions was used to threshold the FCD mean. Time points with FCD mean greater than the threshold were designated as the coherent state (high FCD mean), while time points with FCD mean lower than the threshold were designated as the incoherent state (low FCD mean). The SW-STD was then averaged across all cortical regions and all runs of each participant. As shown in Fig.  , the SW-STD was significantly higher during the coherent state than the incoherent state (  p   = 6.9e–150). Similar results were obtained for the pMFM simulations (Fig.  ). The dwell time distributions of the two states were also similar between the empirical and simulated data (Supplementary Fig.  ). The two distributions appeared to follow an exponential distribution (as opposed to a Gamma distribution), suggesting the presence of multi-stability rather than meta-stability . \n\n\n### Sensory-motor regions drive switching behavior in functional connectivity dynamics \n  \nIn the previous section, we found a striking correspondence between the FCD mean time course and the regional SW-STD time courses (Fig.  ). We note that the FCD mean time course reflected cortex-wide fluctuations in FC patterns, while SW-STD time courses were region-specific. Therefore, to investigate regional heterogeneity of FCD-STD correspondence (Fig.  ) across the cortex, the correlation between the first derivative of the FCD mean time course and the first derivative of the SW-STD time course was computed for each cortical region. In the case of empirical observations, the FCD-STD correlations were averaged across all runs of all participants in the test set yielding a final FCD-STD correlational spatial map (Fig.  ). In the case of pMFM simulations, the correlations were averaged across 1000 random simulations using the best model parameters from the validation set using structural connectivity (SC) from the test set, yielding a final FCD-STD correlational spatial map (Fig.  ).    Sensory-motor regions drive sharp transitions in functional connectivity dynamics (FCD).  \n A   FCD-STD correlations obtained by correlating the first derivative of the FCD mean time course and the first derivative of the SW-STD time course of each cortical region. These correlations were performed for each HCP test participant and averaged across all runs and participants.   B   Same as   A   but simulated from pMFM using the best model parameters from the validation set and structural connectivity from the test set. The correlations were averaged across 1000 random simulations.   C   Correlation between empirical and simulated FCD-STD correlation spatial maps from   B   and   C  , showing strong correspondence between empirical and simulated results.   D   Casual perturbation of top 5 FCD-STD correlated regions (  B  ) during the incoherent state (low FCD mean) led to a transition into the coherent state (high FCD mean). As a control analysis, perturbation of the bottom 5 FCD-STD correlated regions (  B  ) during the incoherent state (low FCD mean) did not lead to a state change (FCD mean remains low). There are 297 independent samples for each boxplot in   D  . The boxes show the inter-quartile range (IQR) and the median. Whiskers indicate 1.5 IQR. Red crosses represent outliers.   E   Example FCD from the perturbation experiments. (Left) original incoherent state. (Middle) perturbation of top 5 FCD-STD correlated regions (sensory-motor drivers). (Right) perturbation of bottom 5 FCD-STD correlated regions. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. \n  \n\nStatistical significance was established using a permutation test (see “Methods” section). Almost all cortical regions were significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (FDR   q   < 0.05; Fig.  ). Across both pMFM simulations and empirically observed data, FCD-STD correlations were the highest in sensory-motor regions and lowest in the association cortex. There was strong spatial correspondence between simulated and empirical results (  r   = 0.87; Fig.  ). We note that the pMFM was optimized to yield realistic FCD with no regard for spatial correspondence, so the high level of spatial correspondence suggests that the pMFM was able to generalize to new unseen properties of FCD. \n\nTo explore the causal relationship between sensory-motor regions and FCD, we tested whether perturbation of sensory-motor regions could “kick” the system from an incoherent FCD state to a coherent FCD state. Among 1000 random simulations of pMFM, time segments in the incoherent state (low FCD mean) lasting for at least 200 contiguous fMRI time points were selected. The neural signals of the top five FCD-STD regions (sensory-motor drivers; Fig.  ) were then perturbed to increase their amplitude. The perturbation led to the successful transition of the FCD into a more coherent state with a higher FCD mean (  p   = 6e–14; Fig.  ). Perturbation of the bottom five FCD-STD regions (Fig.  ) did not lead to an increase in FCD mean. Figure   illustrates the example results of the perturbation experiment. Similar results were obtained if we perturbed the top 10 and bottom 10 regions. Overall, this suggests that sensory-motor regions were a driver of switching behavior in FCD. \n\n\n### Parvalbumin–somatostatin and first genetic principal component correlate with sensory-motor drivers of time-varying functional connectivity dynamics \n  \nResults from the previous sections suggest that time-varying amplitude of sensory-motor regions tracks switching behavior in time-varying functional connectivity. A recent study  demonstrated that the difference in the spatial distribution of molecular markers of parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons (PVALB-SST) is linked with the amplitude of regional fMRI signals (Fig.  ). This intriguing finding is in line with data in rodents documenting the importance of these interneuron classes in local cortical circuit function . Inspection of the cortical distribution of PVALB-SST transcripts from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) dataset (Fig.  ) suggests a strong similarity with the FCD-STD correlational spatial maps (Fig.  ).    Correlations between the spatial distribution of sensory-motor drivers (FCD-STD correlational spatial maps) and gene expression spatial maps.  \n A   Difference in normalized expressions of parvalbumin and somatostatin (PVALB-SST) from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). Panel is a re-rendering of ref.  .   B   Correlation between empirical FCD-STD correlational map (Fig.  ) and PVALB-SST gene expression map.   C   Correlation between simulated FCD-STD correlational map (Fig.  ) and PVALB/SST gene expression map.   D   Table of correlations between FCD-STD correlational spatial maps and two gene expression maps: PVALB-SST and first principal component of gene expression . The “spin test” tested the significance of the correlations while controlling for spatial autocorrelation. The “random gene pair” tested for the specificity of PVALB-SST by randomly sampling pairs of brain-specific genes.   P  -values that survived the false discovery rate (  q   < 0.05) are bolded. Standard deviations reported in the table were obtained by bootstrapping. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. \n  \n\nPVALB-SST (Fig.  ) was averaged within each cortical ROI and correlated with the FCD-STD correlational spatial maps (Fig.  ). The correlations were 0.72 and 0.65 for the empirical (Fig.  ) and simulated (Fig.  ) data, respectively. As shown in Fig.  , both correlations were significant based on spin-tests preserving spatial autocorrelation . To test for specificity of PVALB-SST, a null distribution was also generated based on random pairs of brain-specific genes. Both correlations were again significant (Fig.  ). Overall, this suggests that the spatial distribution of sensory-motor drivers was associated with the differential expression of PVALB and SST \n\nGiven that previous studies have suggested the existence of multiple similar gene expression gradients, the first principal component of AHBA brain-specific gene expression data  was correlated with the FCD-STD correlational spatial maps (Fig.  ). The first gene expression principal component was also correlated with both empirical and simulated FCD-STD spatial maps, although the correlations were slightly weaker than the correlations with the PVALB-SST gene expression map (Fig.  ). \n\nThe recurrent connection strength   and noise amplitude   were also correlated with the PVALB-SST gene expression map under the spin-test, but not the random-gene-pair tests. This suggests a lack of specificity to PVALB-SST (Fig.  ). The external input   was not correlated with any gene expression pattern. \n\n\n### Specificity of T1w/T2w map and FC gradient \n  \nWe have shown that combining T1w/T2w map and FC gradient led to more realistic brain dynamics than using either no gradient or only one gradient (Fig.  ). To further explore the specificity of the parameterization, we repeated the training-validation-test procedure (Fig.  ) using randomly rotated versions of T1w/T2w map and/or FC gradient. Despite having the same degrees of freedom as the original pMFM, the rotated parameterizations led to a worse fit to static FC and/or FCD in the test set (Supplementary Fig.  ). \n\nWe also repeated the training-validation-test procedure with alternate gradient maps, including the second FC gradient , inter-subject functional connectivity variability map , first structural covariance gradient , and the first genetic principal component (Supplementary Fig.  ). To provide additional context, Supplementary Fig.   shows the correlations among the different gradient maps and the top estimated model parameters ( ,  ,  ) from the original pMFM (Fig.  ). \n\nThe estimated model parameters were most strongly correlated with the first principal gradient, although we note that the first principal gradient alone did not lead to the best performance in the test set (Supplementary Fig.  ). Instead, the best single parameterization was the T1w/T2w map. Combining T1w/T2w map with the first FC gradient (i.e., original pMFM) led to the best performance in the test set, but the improvement was not statistically significant when the T1w/T2w map was replaced with inter-subject FC variability, the first genetic principal component or second FC gradient. However, we note that in these cases, the resulting FCD-STD correlation maps remained highly similar to the original FCD-STD map (Fig.  ) with correlations >0.9, suggesting that these cortical features may index similar underlying mechanisms. \n\n\n### Control analyses \n  \nTo ensure the robustness of results, we performed several control analyses. First, we note that the simulation of pMFM utilized 10 ms time step. To ensure that this time step was sufficiently small, the best model parameters from the validation set were applied to the test set using 1 ms time step. KS distance between empirical and simulated FCD in the test set was 0.11 ± 0.05. The correlation between empirical and simulated static FC was 0.66 ± 0.03. \n\nSecond, the previous analyses utilized a sliding window comprising 83 time points for computing FCD. To ensure the model parameters generalized to different window lengths, empirical and simulated FCD was computed in the test set using window lengths of 43 and 125. KS distance between empirical and simulated FCD in the test set was 0.15 ± 0.07 and 0.14 ± 0.04 for window lengths 43 and 125, respectively. \n\nThird, we investigated whether the FCD-STD correlation maps (Fig.  ) might be influenced by global signal fluctuation. We repeated the analysis by restricting to 50 test participants with the lowest global signal fluctuation. The resulting FCD-STD correlation map was very similar to the original results (  r   = 0.82). \n\nFourth, although time-varying FC was represented using the FCD matrix (Fig.  ), other representations could be possible. Zalesky and colleagues explored time-varying FC by computing time-varying network efficiency for each sliding window . They found high and low-efficiency states, which appeared to correspond to the high and low coherent states in the FCD matrix (Supplementary Fig.  ). The pMFM also captured these high and low-efficiency states in test set (Supplementary Fig.  ). On the other hand, the spatially homogeneous MFM could generate high and low-efficiency states in the training set, but not the test set (Supplementary Fig.  ,  ). \n\nFifth, we replicated our results with a higher resolution parcellation with 100 cortical ROIs . Consistent with our main results, we found that pMFM yielded more realistic simulated FC and FCD in the test set (Supplementary Fig.  ) compared with our previous study . Across all 10 best parameter sets from the validation set, noise amplitude increased from sensory-motor to association (limbic, control, and default) networks, while external input exhibited the opposite direction. In 8 of the 10 best parameter sets, recurrent connect strength increased from sensory-motor to association (limbic, control, and default) networks, thus again suggesting potential degeneracy (Supplementary Fig.  ). \n\nIn the Schaefer parcellation, time-varying amplitude of sensory-motor time courses tracks switching behavior in time-varying functional connectivity (Supplementary Figs.   and  ). Causal perturbation analysis also confirmed that sensory-motor regions appeared to drive transitions in FCD (Supplementary Fig.  ). Both simulated and empirical FCD-STD correlation maps were correlated with PVALB-SST gene expression maps (Supplementary Table  ). Both correlations were significant under the spin-test and random gene-pair tests. The simulated, but not the empirical, FCD-STD correlation maps were correlated with the first principal component of gene expression. \n\nFinally, to explore the possibility of individual-level pMFMs, we considered 12 participants from the HCP test-retest dataset that overlapped with our test set. There were four MRI sessions for each participant. The first two sessions and the last two sessions were on average 3.8 ± 1.5 months apart. Similar to previous analyses, the pMFM was optimized using group-level FC gradient and group-level T1w/T2w map from the training set. The main difference is that the model was optimized using group-level SC from the test set, as well as static FC and FCD from the first two sessions of individual participants. The top 10 parameter sets from the first two sessions were then evaluated in the remaining two sessions. We found that combining T1w/T2w map and FC gradient yielded more realistic static FC and FCD than using T1w/T2w map or FC gradient alone at the individual level (Fig.  ). Future studies will explore whether individual-level FC gradient, T1w/T2w map, and SC could bring further benefits to individual-level MFMs.    At the individual-level, pMFM parameterized by both group-level FC gradient and T1w/T2w map yielded more realistic static FC and FCD than FC gradient or T1w/T2w map alone.  \n A   Agreement (Pearson’s correlation) between simulated and empirically observed static FC in the test sessions of individual participants.

Both empirical and simulated fMRI data exhibited multi-stable properties, in which there was spontaneous switching between a high coherent state and a low coherent state. The multi-stability was tracked by the time-varying amplitude of regional fMRI signals. By performing causal perturbations of the large-scale circuit model, we demonstrated that spontaneous amplitude fluctuations of sensory-motor regions were a driver of the observed switching behavior. Furthermore, the relationship between regional fMRI amplitude and functional connectivity dynamics was also associated with PVALB-SST and the first principal component of gene expression, suggesting that heterogeneity in excitation-inhibition balance might shape multi-stability in FC dynamics. \n\n### Anatomical and functional gradients contribute to spontaneous brain dynamics \n  \nPrevious studies have proposed a dominant gradient of cortical organization with sensory-motor and association regions at opposing ends . Supporting this idea of a dominant axis, many studies have emphasized similarities among gradients estimated from diverse sources, including resting-state FC principal gradient, T1w/T2w myelin estimate, gene expression data, functional task activation, and computational modeling . Yet, there are clear differences among the gradients and a growing number of studies have suggested dissociations among multiple spatially similar gradients . Here, we showed that by parameterizing local circuit parameters with both anatomical (T1w/T2w) and functional (FC) gradients, the resulting mean-field model was able to generate dramatically more realistic static FC and FC dynamics than either gradient alone (Fig.  ). \n\nOur control analysis with alternate gradient maps suggests that combining the T1w/T2w map with the first FC gradient led to the best performance, but T1w/T2w could be replaced with inter-subject FC variability, first genetic principal component, or second FC gradient without statistically significant loss in performance. Furthermore, while it made intuitive sense that utilizing the resting-state FC gradient would help to explain resting-fMRI dynamics, the training-validation-test scheme ensured the analysis was not circular. \n\nThe optimized mean-field model exhibited opposing gradient directions across local circuit parameters (Fig.  ). Across all top ten parameter sets, noise amplitude increased from sensory-motor to association cortex, while external input decreased from sensory-motor to association cortex. The higher external input in sensory-motor regions might reflect the flow of sensory information from the external environment via subcortical relays. In the case of the recurrent connection strength, nine of the ten best parameter sets exhibited increasing values from sensory-motor to association cortex, but one parameter set exhibited the opposite direction. Thus, recurrent connection strength might exhibit potential degeneracies in mean-field models, thus explaining contradictions in the literature . \n\n\n### Multi-stability in spontaneous brain dynamics \n  \nThe spontaneous ebb and flow observed in FC dynamics is an intriguing property that has fascinated the field . As shown in Fig.  , there are periods of brain activity with strong coherent FC and periods with incoherent FC. We found that the coherent FC state was characterized by larger fMRI signal amplitude across brain regions, while the incoherent FC state was characterized by smaller fMRI signal amplitude (Fig.  ). Intriguingly, transitions in the regional amplitude of sensory-motor regions appeared to track switching behavior in FC dynamics (Fig.  ). Perturbations of the mean-field model suggest that this relationship might be causal. \n\nRegional fMRI amplitude has been previously linked with the differential expression of PVALB and SST across the cortex . PVALB and SST interneurons preferentially target perisomatic regions and dendrites of pyramidal cells, respectively, and are thought to regulate synaptic outputs and inputs, respectively . Thus the spatially heterogeneous distribution of PVALB and SST interneurons  might modulate regional neural signal amplitude . Here, we found that PVALB-SST gene expression map correlates with the spatial distribution of sensory-motor drivers whose time-varying amplitude tracks functional connectivity dynamics (Fig.  ). \n\nHowever, we note that this association cannot be solely attributed to PVALB-SST given that the gradients of PVALB-SST expression are embedded within a broader pattern of gene expression variation across the cortex . Indeed, the spatial distribution of sensory-motor drivers was also correlated with the first principal component of cortical genes (Fig.  ). The first gene principal component has been shown to strongly correlate with the spatial distribution of genes coding for different excitatory and inhibitory neurons , which might reflect spatial heterogeneity in excitation-inhibition balance . Overall, this suggests a potential link between FC dynamics and heterogeneity in excitation/inhibition balance across the cortex. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data \n  \nWe considered 1052 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) S1200 release . All participants were scanned on a customized Siemens 3T Skyra using a multi-band sequence. Four resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) runs were collected for each participant in two sessions on two different days. Each rs-fMRI run was acquired with a repetition time (TR) of 0.72 s at 2 mm isotropic resolution and lasted for 14.4 min. The diffusion imaging consisted of 6 runs, each lasting ~9 min and 50 s. Diffusion weighting consisted of 3 shells of   b   = 1000, 2000, and 3000 s/mm  with an approximately equal number of weighting directions on each shell. Details of the data collection can be found elsewhere . The 1052 subjects were randomly divided into training (  N   = 351), validation (  N   = 350) and test (  N   = 351) sets. \n\nData collection was approved by a consortium of institutions institutional review boards (IRBs) in the United States and Europe, led by Washington University (St Louis) and the University of Minnesota (WU-Minn HCP Consortium). The current study was approved by the IRB of the National University of Singapore. \n\n\n### Preprocessing \n  \nDetails of the HCP preprocessing can be found in the HCP S1200 manual. We utilized rs-fMRI data, which had already been projected to fsLR surface space, denoised with ICA-FIX and smoothed by 2 mm. For each run of each participant, the fMRI data were averaged within each Desikan–Killiany  ROI to generate a 68 × 1200 matrix. Each 68 × 1200 matrix was used to compute 68 × 68 FC matrix by correlating the time courses among all pairs of time courses. The FC matrices were then averaged across runs of participants within the training (or validation or test) set, resulting in a group-averaged training (or validation or test) FC matrix. \n\nFunctional connectivity dynamics (FCD) was computed as follows. For each run of each participant, FC was computed within each of 1118 sliding windows. The length of each sliding window was 83 time points (60 s) as recommended by previous studies . We note that our results were robust to window length (see “Control analysis” in the Results section). Each sliding window FC matrix was then vectorized by only considering the upper triangular entries. The vectorized FCs were correlated with each other generating a 1118 × 1118 FCD matrix. \n\nIn the case of diffusion MRI, generalized Q-sampling imaging (GQI) was used to reconstruct the white matter pathways, allowing for complex diffusion fiber configurations and streamline tractography . A 68 × 68 structural connectivity (SC) matrix was generated for each subject, where each entry corresponded to the number of streamlines between two ROIs. To generate a group-level SC matrix, a thresholding procedure was employed to remove false positives. More specifically, if <50% of participants had a non-zero value in a particular entry in the SC matrix, then the entry is set to zero in all individual-level SC matrices. For each SC entry, the number of streamlines was averaged across participants with non-zero streamlines. Separate group-level SC matrices were computed for the training, validation, and test sets. \n\n\n### Dynamic mean-field model (MFM) \n  \nThe MFM was derived by the mean-field reduction of a detailed spiking neuronal network model . For each cortical ROI, the neural activity obeys the following nonlinear stochastic differential equations: where  , and   denote the average synaptic gating variable, population firing rate, and total input current of the  th cortical ROI. The total input current   is the superposition of three inputs. The first input, the intra-regional input, is controlled by the recurrent connection strength  . The second input, the inter-regional input, is controlled by the SC matrix (  is the SC between regions   and  ), as well as a global scaling factor  . The third input is the external input current  , which might include inputs from subcortical relays. Following previous studies , the synaptic coupling   was set to  . The parameter values of the input-output function   were set to  ,  , and  . The kinetic parameters for synaptic activity were set to   and  .   is uncorrelated standard Gaussian noise and the noise amplitude is controlled by  . \n\nThe simulated neural activities   were fed to the Balloon–Windkessel hemodynamic model  to simulate the fMRI BOLD signals for each ROI. The equations and parameters were exactly the same as our previous study . More specifically, the MFM and hemodynamic model were simulated using Euler’s integration with a time step of 10 ms. The starting values of   in the MFM were randomly initialized. Simulation length for the fMRI signals was 16.4 min. The first 2 min of the fMRI signals were discarded and the time series were downsampled to 0.72 s to have the same temporal resolution as the empirical fMRI signals in the HCP. The simulated fMRI signals could then be used to generate simulated FC and FCD matrices. \n\n\n### Parametric mean-field model (pMFM) \n  \nIn our previous study , the recurrent connection strength  , external input current  , global constant   and noise amplitude   were optimized by fitting to static FC. The recurrent connection strength   and external input current   were allowed to vary independently across cortical ROIs, while   and   were assumed to be constant. On the other hand , parameterized the recurrent connection strengths with the T1w/T2w myelin map. \n\nIn this study, recurrent connection strength  , external input current   and noise amplitude   were allowed to vary across brain regions, while   was kept as a constant. Instead of allowing  ,   and   to vary independently , we parameterized  ,   and   as linear combinations of group-level T1w/T2w myelin maps  and the first principal gradient of functional connectivity : where  ,  , and   denoted the recurrent connection strength, external input current, and noise amplitude, respectively, of the  th cortical region.   and   were the average values of the T1w/T2w myelin map and the first FC principal gradient within the  th cortical ROI. Both T1w/T2w myelin maps and first principal gradient of functional connectivity were computed from the HCP training set. Therefore, there are a total of 10 unknown parameters:   G   and linear coefficients ( ). These unknown parameters were be estimated from the HCP training set (see next section). \n\n\n### Cost function to minimize disagreement with empirical static FC and FCD \n  \nThe 10 unknown parameters in the pMFM were estimated by maximizing fit to static FC and FCD in the HCP training set. For a particular set of parameters, the pMFM could be used to generate simulated FC and FCD matrices. The agreement between the simulated and empirical static FC matrices was defined as the Pearson’s correlation (  r  ) between the   z  -transformed upper triangular entries of the two matrices. Larger   r   indicated more similar static FC. Pearson’s correlation was chosen given its popularity in the literature. However, we note that Pearson’s correlation ignored scale differences between empirical and simulated static FC, which led to pMFM-simulated static FC values being systematically larger than empirical FC values (Fig.  ). In future studies, we will explore an additional cost term that penalizes absolute differences between empirical and static FC. \n\nThe disagreement between the simulated and empirical FCD matrices was defined as the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) distance between the probability distribution functions (pdfs) constructed from the upper triangular entries of the two matrices . The pdf of an FCD matrix was constructed by collapsing the upper triangular entries of the matrix into a histogram and normalized to have an area of one. A smaller KS distance indicated a more similar FCD. To optimize fit to both static FC and FCD, an overall cost was defined as (1 −   r  ) + KS. Thus lower cost implies a better fit to static FC and FCD. \n\nTo minimize the cost function in the training set, we seek to compute an “average” FCD matrix. We note that FCD matrices could not be directly averaged across rs-fMRI runs and participants because there was no temporal correspondence across runs during the resting-state. Because the goal here was to compute the KS distance, we simply averaged the pdfs from the FCD matrices all the runs of all participants within the training set, which we referred to as average FCD pdf. When evaluating KS distance in the validation and test sets, average FCD pdfs were also computed using the same approach. \n\n\n### Optimization procedure \n  \nTo optimize the cost function, we considered three algorithms: covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES ), self-organizing migrating algorithm (SOMA ) and hyperparameter optimization using radial basis functions and dynamic coordinate search (HORD ). \n\nGiven a particular random initialization of the 10 unknown parameters, the three algorithms (CMA-ES, SOMA, HORD) were applied to the HCP training set. Each algorithm was iterated 500 times, generating 500 candidate parameter sets. This procedure was repeated 10 times, yielding 5000 candidate parameter sets. For each algorithm, the 5000 candidate parameter sets were evaluated in the validation set to obtain the top 10 candidate parameter sets. To ensure diversity among the parameter sets, the procedure to select the top 10 parameter sets was as follows. First, the parameter set with the lowest validation cost was selected. Then, the parameter set with the lowest validation cost and whose parameter maps exhibited less than 0.98 correlation with the current selected parameter set(s) was selected. This procedure was repeated until 10 parameter sets were selected. Across the three algorithms, CMA-ES performed the best in the validation set (Supplementary Fig.  ), so this study focused on CMA-ES. \n\nThe top 10 candidate parameter sets from CMA-ES were then applied to the HCP test set SC. For each parameter set, 1000 simulations were performed, yielding 1000 simulated static FC and FCD matrices. The 1000 simulated FC and FCD pdfs were then averaged, yielding an average simulated FC and an average simulated FCD pdf. Pearson’s correlation was then computed between the average simulated FC and the average empirical FC from the HCP test set. Similarly, KS statistics was computed between the average simulated FCD pdf and the average empirical FCD pdf from the HCP test set. \n\nWe note that by collapsing the entries of the FCD matrix into a pdf, we were ignoring the recurrent structure in the FCD matrix. Supplementary Fig.   shows the FCD pdfs of empirical and simulated data. At the individual-level, the FCD pdf exhibited a bimodal distribution. Because the FCD pdfs were shifted across participants, the group-level FCD pdf was unimodal. Although the pMFM was fitted to the group-level FCD pdf, the resulting FCD distribution exhibited hints of bimodality and recurrent structure similar to empirical FCD (Fig.  ). \n\n\n### Statistical test of correlation between first derivatives of FCD mean and SW-STD \n  \nTo quantify the correspondence between FCD mean and SW-STD (Fig.  ), the correlation between the first derivative of the FCD mean time course and the first derivative of the SW-STD time course was computed for each cortical region (Fig.  ). To compute the statistical significance of the correlations, fMRI runs were permuted across participants. For each ROI, the FCD-STD correlations were recomputed and averaged across runs and participants, yielding a single null correlation value. This permutation procedure was repeated 10,000 times, so that a null distribution of correlations was obtained for each ROI. \n\n\n### Causal perturbations of pMFM \n  \nTo more directly link sensory-motor regions with FCD, we tested whether perturbation of sensory-motor regions can “kick” the system from an incoherent FCD state to a coherent FCD state. Among 1000 random simulations of the pMFM, time segments in the incoherent (low FCD mean) state lasting for at least 200 contiguous fMRI time points (TRs) were selected, yielding 300 time segments. Low FCD mean was defined as being <0.6. \n\nPerturbation was applied to the neural signals (synaptic gating variable  ) of the top 5 regions whose SW-STD correlated with FCD (Fig.  ). We note that during the incoherent state, the values of the synaptic gating variables could be low or high. To increase the amplitude of the neural signals, we would decrease (or increase) the synaptic gating variables if they were high (or low). More specifically, let   S   and   S   be the maximum and minimum synaptic gating variable values across all cortical regions. When the neural signal was low, we set  , where   corresponded to the resolution of the simulations, which is 0.01 s in the current study. When the neural signal was high, we set  . The perturbations were applied for 72 iterations, corresponding to 1 TR in the simulated fMRI signal. \n\n\n### Gene expression analysis \n  \nPublicly available human gene expression data from six postmortem donors (1 female), aged 24–57 years (42.5 ± 13.4) were obtained from the Allen Institute . Processing followed the pipeline from Anderson and colleagues  ( ), yielding 17,448 brain-expressed genes and 1683 analyzable cortical samples. Our analyses in turn focused on 2413 brain-specific genes .   Z  -normalized gene expression values of parvalbumin (PVALB) and somatostatin (SST) were averaged within each cortical region and the difference was computed. The FCD-STD correlation maps (Fig.  ) were correlated with the PVALB-SST spatial map (Fig.  ). \n\nTo establish statistical significance, we considered two approaches. First, we considered the spin test. The parcellations were randomly rotated. For each rotated parcellation, we recomputed the PVALB-SST difference and correlated the resulting gene expression maps with the FCD-STD correlation maps, yielding a single null correlation value. This was repeated 1000 times yielding a complete null distribution. \n\nTo test the specificity of PVALB-SST, we performed random-gene-pair tests. A random pair of genes were selected from the 2413 brain-specific genes . Gene expression difference between the random gene pairs was computed and correlated with the STD-FCD correlation maps generating a null correlation value. This was repeated 10,000 times yielding a complete null distribution. \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the   linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"c9ed6488f3bd454ab6eaf994bb5f81ce"},

The functional connectivity (FC) of the brain circuits for goal‐directed or habitual behavior has not been clearly reported in tobacco‐dependent groups. Smoking is one of the factors in the formation of atherosclerosis. Studies have shown that the thickness of carotid intima‐media (cIMT) is associated with attention‐executive‐psychomotor functioning. Therefore, we hypothesized whether cIMT in tobacco‐dependent individuals is associated with changes in the FC of the dual‐system network. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nA total of 29 male tobacco‐dependent subjects (tobacco‐dependent group) (mean age: 64.20 years, standard deviation [SD]: 4.81 years) underwent resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs‐fMRI). Exactly 28 male nonsmokers (control group) (mean age: 61.95 years, SD: 5.52 years) were also recruited to undergo rs‐fMRI. We used the dorsolateral striatum (putamen) and dorsomedial striatum (caudate) as regions of interest for whole‐brain resting‐state connectivity to construct habitual and goal‐directed brain networks, respectively. In addition, all participants were evaluated by carotid artery ultrasound to obtain the cIMT values. Then, we compared the dual‐system brain networks between the tobacco dependence and control groups and the relationship between cIMT and imbalance of dual‐system brain networks in tobacco dependence. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe results showed a reduction in the connection between the caudate and precuneus and an increased connection between the putamen and prefrontal cortex; and supplementary motor area. The bilateral connectivity between the caudate and inferior frontal gyrus showed a significant negative correlation with the cIMT, and no positive correlation was observed with cIMT in the brain region that connects to the caudate. However, for the putamen, increased connectivity with the inferior temporal and medial frontal gyri was strongly associated with a high cIMT. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe results indicate that the formation of tobacco dependence behavior is related to changes in the dual‐system brain network. Carotid sclerosis is associated with the weakening of the goal‐directed network and enhancement of the habit network in tobacco dependence. This finding suggests that tobacco dependence behavior and clinical vascular diseases are related to changes in brain functional networks. \n\n  \nwe evaluated the conversion of dual‐system networks functional connectivity after tobacco dependence and the relationship between the thickness of the carotid Intima‐Media (cIMT) and the conversion of dual‐system networks functional connectivity\n   \n \n\n# Body\n \n\nSmoking is one of the major public health problems worldwide and the main cause of preventable death in most countries. Although most individuals with tobacco dependence hope to stop, only a handful succeed. Given that tobacco dependence is a chronic brain disorder characterized by forced tobacco use, smokers may lose control of their smoking behavior (Berrendero et al.,  ). A theory has been postulated to explain the formation mechanism of dependent behavior that dysfunctional goal‐directed and habit control systems are central to the pathogenesis of dependent behavior and impaired recovery from addictions (Hyman et al.,  ; Kalivas & O'Brien,  ). Goal‐directed behavior refers to the actions that are performed to achieve the desired goal. When action is taken on certain regularity, habits are formed. Habits can facilitate actions that do not require planning and can lead to great efficiency, but they are often inflexible. Cognitive behavioral theory explains that dependent behavior is a learning disorder; the transition from casual to habitual behavior is associated with reduced goal‐directed behavior, and strengthened habitual behavior (Everitt & Robbins,  ; Linnebank et al.,  ). \n\nNicotine, the major reinforcing component of tobacco smoke, acts in the brain through neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In addition to playing a key role in the behavioral actions of nicotine, which contribute to the development of tobacco dependence, nAChRs also affect the brain circuitries involved in reinforcement, mood, attention, and food consumption (Picciotto & Kenny,  ). Relevant research demonstrated that smokers differ from nonsmokers in terms of their regional brain structure and neurochemistry and activation in response to smoking‐related stimuli and during the execution of cognitive tasks (Azizian et al.,  ). Bruijnzeel's study indicated that acute nicotine administration activates brain areas involved in reward signaling, compulsive drug intake, and motor function. His study also showed that acute nicotine administration leads to the activation of the striato‐thalamo‐orbitofrontal circuit, which plays a role in compulsive behavior. Nicotine‐induced dysregulation of this brain circuit may contribute to the development of compulsive smoking (Bruijnzeel et al.,  ). Contemporary neuroscience aims to understand how neuronal activity produces internal processes and observable behavioral states. This aim crucially depends on network‐based analyses of the working brain given that behavioral states arise from information flow and connectivity within and between discrete and overlapping brain regions, which form brain networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a key to advancing brain network neuroscience. fMRI measures inter and intraregional circuits at behaviorally relevant spatial temporal resolution. Here, we propose that brain networks obtained from clinical fMRI models can provide a better understanding of cross‐sectional observations of populations. \n\nThe functional connectivity (FC) of the brain circuits for goal‐directed or habitual behavior has not been studied previously in tobacco dependence groups. Using fMRI, several studies investigated the brain response to smoking‐related stimuli. Baker et al. ( ) observed that compared with monetary rewards, cigarette rewards showed a higher reward response in the tobacco dependence group. This finding suggests that cigarette addicts show deficits in the recruitment of brain reward pathways (Lin et al.,  ). A study of the neurological effects of “smoking” electronic cigarettes using task‐state fMRI showed brain activation in the motor cortex, cingulate cortex, putamen, thalamus, globus pallidum, and cerebellum and relative inactivation of the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (Wall et al.,  ). All these studies showed that overreliance on habitual system contributes to the development of tobacco dependence behavior. \n\nCigarette smoking is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases (Ockene & Miller,  ). Substantial evidence supports the promoting effect of nicotine on atherosclerosis in a long‐term basis although short‐term exposure to nicotine is considered relatively harmless (Heeschen et al.,  ). Increasing pieces of evidence have demonstrated that nicotine impairs the cardiovascular system by targeting vascular endothelial cells, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Brain networks change in normal aging and cognitive disorders, Parkinson's, and autoimmune diseases (Chung et al.,  ; Filippi et al.,  ; Srivishagan et al.,  ; Valdés Hernández et al.,  ). Intimal‐medial thickening (IMT) of the carotid wall is an accepted peripheral marker of atherosclerosis. It is associated with the increased risk for myocardial infarction and stroke and low attention‐executive‐psychomotor functioning. Haley's research illustrated that the blood oxygenation level‐dependent contrast is highly sensitive to peripheral vascular health as measured by IMT. He demonstrated that a high IMT was associated with signal intensity in the right middle frontal gyrus (Haley et al.,  ). Sweet's research showed that normal performance of a challenging verbal working memory task among high‐functioning multiple sclerosis patients was associated with a shift toward greater activity in regions related to sensorimotor functions and anterior attentional/executive components of the verbal working memory system (Sweet et al.,  ). Therefore, we hypothesized whether the strength of target and habitual brain network connectivity is correlated with carotid intima thickness in smokers. \n\nThe putamen and caudate are core regions of habitual and goal‐directed networks (Tricomi et al.,  ; van der Straten et al.,  ; Watson et al.,  ). The dysfunction of both structures is considered the neuroanatomical basis of dependence (Tau et al.,  ). However, the dual‐system theory does not explain the typical clinical observations of carotid atherosclerosis associated with cognition and decision‐making (van der Flier et al.,  ). Sojkova et al. ( ) discovered that a high carotid intima‐media thickness (cIMT) was associated with a low regional cerebral blood flow in lingual, inferior occipital, and superior temporal regions in older adults. Brutto pointed out that the association between increased cIMT and cognitive dysfunction is mostly mediated by the increase in age (Del Brutto et al.,  ). Furthermore, studies on healthy aging humans have shown that aging affects controlled and conscious processing that impairs goal‐directed ability (de Wit et al.,  ; Span et al.,  ; Tomás et al.,  ; Worthy et al.,  ). Elijah used novel tablet‐based pointing tasks to prove the greater effect of age on response time in goal‐directed tasks compared with that in habitual tasks (Li et al.,  ). However, aging and atherosclerosis studies showed that atherosclerosis is a marker of cellular senescence (Wang & Bennett,  ). Based on the above research, we hypothesized the possible transformation in the two‐system brain network in tobacco‐dependent people and association of cIMT with the transformation of the two‐system brain network. However, this new model that connects the cIMT with the neuroscience‐inspired dual‐system theory of dependent behavior remains to be tested. \n\nIn this study, we investigated the relationship of cIMT with resting‐state FC in the caudate, which serves as the primary center of the goal‐directed network, and in the putamen, which serves as the primary center of the habit network. Meanwhile, we compared the dual‐system brain networks between the tobacco dependence and control groups. We hypothesized that comparative studies of tobacco dependence would reveal the neuroimaging mechanisms about the disequilibrium between goal‐directed and habit control networks (prefrontal cortex (PFC)/caudate and premotor cortex/putamen, respectively) (de Wit et al.,  ; Delorme et al.,  ; Yamagata et al.,  ). Specifically, we aimed to determine whether connectivity is reduced within the goal‐directed network and increased within the habit network. According to previous studies, cIMT affects the cognitive decision‐making ability of the elderly. Thus, we hypothesized that this transition is related to atherosclerosis. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of 62 participants were enrolled in the study through the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. Two participants withdrew from the experiment, and three fMRI datasets were not usable due to more than 1.5° of head movement. The remaining 29 participants in the smoking group were 55–75‐year old (mean age: 64.20 years, standard deviation [SD]: 4.81 years), and 28 participants in the control group had a range of 55–75 years (mean age: 61.95 years, SD: 5.52 years). They all participated in this study (Table   shows other participant characteristics). The ethics committee of Qingdao University Medical College approved this study, and all participants signed an informed consent. All the participants met the following inclusion criteria: ⑴ no contraindications to MRI; ⑵ no brain disease (space‐occupying lesion, infarction, or ischemic focus) or other medical conditions (heart, lung, liver, and kidney); ⑶ no cognitive impairment and IQ scores of more than 90 points; ⑷ meeting the diagnostic criteria of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, that is, daily smoking volume of not less than 10 cigarettes and smoking age of not less than 2 years or less than 3 months in the last year (Vieta,  ); ⑸ no other history of addiction; ⑹ can complete the questionnaire; ⑺ have completed the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) (Heatherton et al.,  ). \n  \nDemographic data, psychological data (  x   ±   s  ) \n    \n\n### Procedure \n  \nAll participants underwent an interview for psychiatric screening by completing the FTND scale, and psychometric assessment was carried out by a trained geriatrician prior to the fMRI scan. The mental cognitive assessment included (1) MMSE for rapid screening of cognitive function, (2) IQ test, and (3) Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Then, the participants lay on the examination bed awake and at rest, with their eyes closed and them breathing calmly for the resting‐state fMRI (rs‐fMRI). Afterward, they were examined by carotid ultrasonography. \n\n\n### MRI scanning parameters and conditions \n  \nAll participants lay on the examination bed awake and at rest, with their eyes closed and calm breathing. Scanning was performed with the GE3.0T HDX superconducting whole‐body MRI system. The parameters for three‐dimensional magnetization preparation fast gradient‐echo sequence scan for T1‐weighted images were as follows: parameter TE = 2.3 ms; prep time = 450 ms; FA = 15°; bandwidth = 19.23; FOV = 23 mm × 23 mm; layer thickness = 1.0 mm; pitch = 0 mm; matrix = 230 × 230; NEXl.00, 178 floors. The parameters for single excitation of fMRI and gradient‐echo planar imaging scan for T2‐weighted images were as follows: parameter TE/TR = 30/2000 ms; layer thickness = 4.0 mm; layer spacing = 0 mm; matrix = 64 × 64; FA = 900; FOV = 23 mm × 23 mm; NEX = 1; 45 scan layers; scan time: 5 min and 10 s. \n\n\n### Carotid ultrasonography \n  \nAll the subjects were examined by color Doppler ultrasonography (GE LOGIQ E9) by ultrasound physicians in our hospital. Evaluation was performed in the supine position in a dark and quiet room. After both sides of the common carotid artery were maximized in the longitudinal plane, the cIMT was measured at the far wall of the common carotid artery about 1–1.5 cm from the bifurcation. cIMT measurement was obtained by averaging the distance between the lumen‐intima and media–adventica interface. The mean value of three bilateral measurements was considered the final cIMT value. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### fMRI data \n  \nMatlab 2010b platform (Matrix Laboratory,  ), which includes SPM 8 ( ), DPARSF 2.1 ( ), Rest 1.6 ( ), and BrainNet Viewer software package (NITRC: BrainNet Viewer: Tool/Resource Info), was used for all rs‐fMRI data processing. We calculated the fractional amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuations and functional connection value and accomplished a brain map presentation. Image preprocessing included space normalization, time correction, smoothing, head movement correction, and filtering. All functional images were then smoothed using a 4 mm Gaussian kernel. The sampling rate was 3 × 3 × 3 mm , the time series in each session was band‐pass filtered (0.01–0.08 Hz), and linear drift removal was performed. All images automatically formed a data file after preprocessing. If the head of a participant moved by more than 1.5 mm or rotated by more than 1.5° on any of   x  ‐,   y  ‐, or   z  ‐axis, the participant was excluded. \n\n##### Brain map \n  \nWhole‐brain resting‐state connectivity was examined using 6 mm‐radius spherical seeds centered on dorsolateral striatum (putamen DLS) and dorsomedial striatum (caudate DMS) regions of interest (ROIs). We used the Rest 1.6 software to conduct one‐sample   t   test for the smoking and control groups and obtained the FC activation map of the whole brain by the BrainNet Viewer software package (  p   < .01; the whole‐brain default mask was used, with cluster≥19 voxels and corrected by AlphaSim (  p   < .05)). Figure   presents the three‐dimensional brain maps. The green dots and lines represent the control group, and the red ones represent the smoking group. The yellow dots indicate the ROIs. The size was set based on the   t   value of each brain area, and the name was also marked. \n\n\n##### FC data \n  \nBased on the evidence showing that the caudate and putamen participate in behavior execution, we tested our previous hypothesis that the impairment of cognitive domains is related to the imbalance of whole‐brain functional connection of the putamen and caudate in tobacco dependence. We tested the differences in FC of a priori anatomical ROIs between smoking and control subjects based on the known neurobiological profile of habit and goal‐directed and previous findings in the literature (van der Straten et al.,  ; Watson et al.,  ). Whole‐brain resting‐state connectivity was examined using 6 mm‐radius spherical seeds centered on putamen DLS and caudate DMS ROIs. The coordinates were automatically provided by the AFNI‐supplied atlas, caudate (15, 12, 9), and putamen (28, 5, 2) (Harrison et al.,  ). fMRI denoised data were inputted to DPARSF 2.1 to estimate the FC. The mask of the two‐sample   t   test was formed by the two sets of brain areas obtained by single‐sample   t   test, and the formula was (  i  1 +   i  2) (  p   < .01; threshold = 2.7116, degrees of freedom (df) = 55, cluster ≥ 19 voxels, corrected by AlphaSim (  p   < .05)). Fisher's   r  ‐to‐  z   transform was conducted for the appropriate df. \n\n\n##### Carotid ultrasound data \n  \nThe unbalanced functional connection between the putamen and caudate nucleus causes the impaired cognitive domain in tobacco dependence, and this damage can lead to diseases (e.g., arteriosclerosis). To study the neuroimaging mechanism of arteriosclerosis, we performed a correlation analysis using the ROI approach to assess whether the strength of functional connection in preselected ROIs (based on fMRI results) is associated with cIMT (significant threshold is corrected with   p   < .05, and cIMT is different among groups). \n\nStatistical processing of data was carried out in SPSS software. We applied Shapiro–Wilk's test to the normality test. The data with normal distribution were expressed as   and analyzed by   t   test. The skewed distribution data were represented by the median and analyzed by Mann–Whitney rank‐sum test. \n\n\n\n\n\n## RESULT \n  \n### Clinical data \n  \nA total of 29 tobacco‐dependent subjects and 28 nonsmokers participated in our study (Table  ). No significant differences were observed in age, educational level, IQ, MMSE, HAMA, and HAMD results across the two groups (  p   > .05). The cIMT value was significantly higher in the smoking group than the control group (  p   = .03). \n\n\n### FC results \n  \nFor the ROI in caudate, compared with the control participants, the smoking participants exhibited significant a positive correlation with left medial frontal gyrus (MFG) (BA10) and a negative correlation with the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) (BA22) and left precuneus (PCUN) (BA31) (Table   and Figure  ). \n  \nComparison of functional connectivity (FC) between the smoking and control groups \n      \n(A) The images of changes in goal‐directed brain network (the regions of interest [ROI] in caudate) compared between the smoking group and the control group; (B) the images of changes inhabit brain network (the ROI in putamen) compared between the smoking group and the control group. Blue to red indicates that the activation level gradually increased.   p   < .01, cluster ≥ 19 voxels, and corrected by AlphaSim. \n  \nThe ROI in putamen exhibited positive correlations with the PFC (BAs 9, 10, and 47), supplementary motor area (SMA) (BA 6, 8), left lateral globus pallidus, and left cingulate gyrus (BA 31) and negative correlations with the right temporal lobe (BA 41) and right postcentral (BA 5) (Table   and Figure  ). \n\n\n### Carotid ultrasound results \n  \nThe cIMT mean value of the smoking group was 0.96  ±  0.36 mm, that of the control group was 0.80 ± 0.48 mm. Smoking participants had higher cIMT values than the control group (  p   = .03, Table  ). \n\n\n### Associations between cIMT and FC strength \n  \nIn the tobacco dependence group, a higher cIMT was associated with the reduced FC between the caudate and several brain regions, including the right putamen and inferior frontal gyrus, bilaterally (Table   and Figure  \nA). However, an increased connectivity was observed between the putamen, inferior temporal gyrus, and MFG (Table   and Figure  ). The results showed that a high cIMT was associated with decreased FC of the goal‐directed brain network and increased FC of the habit brain network. \n  \nCorrelations between the carotid intima‐media (cIMT) and the two brain network (goal and habit) functional connectivity (FC) in the smoking group \n      \n(A) The images of the association between carotid intima‐media (cIMT) values and goal‐directed brain network in the smoking group; (B) the images of the association between carotid intima‐media (cIMT) values and habit brain network in the smoking group. Blue to red indicates that the activation level gradually increased.   p   < .01, cluster ≥ 19 voxels, and corrected by AlphaSim. \n    \nBrain functional connection map: (A) shows increased functional connections between the whole brain and caudate nucleus in both groups; (B) shows the reduction functional connections between the whole brain and caudate in both groups; (C) shows increased functional connections between the whole brain and putamen in both groups; and (D) shows the reduction functional connections between the whole brain and putamen in both groups. The green dots and lines represent the control group, and red represents the smoking group. The yellow represents the regions of interest [ROI]. The size of the node was set according to its   t   value. The larger the value, the greater the activation intensity.   p   < .01, cluster ≥ 19 voxels, and corrected by AlphaSim. \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn the present study, we examined the relationship between tobacco‐dependent behavior, cIMT, and FC in tobacco‐dependent individuals to test whether the formation of smoking dependence behavior is related to a shift from the goal‐directed to the habit network and whether the accelerated aging of arteries is associated with this transition. Using a seed‐to‐voxel resting‐state analysis, we observed that in the tobacco dependence group, the strengths of functional connections were reduced between seeds (caudate) and left PCUN (BA31) and right STG (BA22) in the goal‐directed network and increased between seeds (caudate) and the left MFG (BA10). The activity of the goal‐directed system was negatively correlated with the cIMT value. In habit brain network of the tobacco dependence group, the strength of functional connections increased between seeds (putamen) and several brain regions, such as PFC (BAs 9, 10, and 47), SMA (BA 6,8), left lateral globus pallidus, and left cingulate gyrus (BA 32), and reduced between seeds and the right temporal lobe (BA 41) and right postcentral (BA 5). The activity of the habit system was positively correlated with the cIMT value. All in all, these results suggest that tobacco dependence behavior is primarily associated with reduced functional activity of the goal‐directed network and increased functional activity in the habit network. Accelerated aging of arteries is associated with this transition. \n\nDual‐system theory assumes that addiction behavior, such as smoking, may be caused by the imbalance between goal‐directed and habitual networks (Woodhead & Robbins,  ). According to previous studies, drug dependence behavior may be related to a reduced ability for dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) to exert goal‐directed control (Smith & Laiks,  ). However, no evidence indicates that dependence behavior leads to an excessive reinforcement of the habitual network. In our results, we did not observe the reducing connectivity of the goal‐directed network with the dlPFC. Conversely, the results revealed a reduction in the connection between the caudate nucleus and PCUN and an increased connection between the putamen and PFC and SMA. PCUN is a part of the default mode network that can direct attention and episodic memory retrieval during the execution of goal‐directed movements (Cavanna & Trimble,  ). It also participates in the process of self‐consciousness and self‐referential that can relate information to the self (Northoff et al.,  ). Compared with the control group, the tobacco dependence group showed decreased connectivity between the goal‐directed network and PCUN. This finding indicates that the ability for attention to the outside world and self‐connection decreases during the implementation of goal‐directed network in tobacco dependence. In the smoking group, we found an increase in the FC between the SMA and putamen. The SMA– striatum loop represents a more direct stimulus–response pathway than the prefrontal–striatum loop (Balleine et al.,  ). Thus, the defectively inhibited and repeated smoking behavior in tobacco dependence may be underpinned by enhanced FC within putamen–SMA circuits. In our study, the enhanced FC in PFC–putamen loops may contribute to dependent behaviors, such that the response may not be directly triggered by the stimulus but may be mediated by abnormal activity in PFC. \n\nThe observation about the shift of the dual system in dependent behavior may be relevant particularly to cIMT. In our study, the bilateral connectivity between the caudate and inferior frontal gyrus showed a significant negative correlation with the cIMT, and no positive correlation was observed with cIMT in the brain region that connects to the caudate. However, for the putamen, increased connectivity with the inferior temporal gyrus and MFG was strongly associated with the high cIMT. This result indicates that tobacco dependence behavior is likely to show a reduction in goal‐directed network connectivity and an enhanced connection in habit network in patients with atherosclerosis. Cognitive studies have shown that a variety of cognitive domains are associated with carotid cIMT (Mergeani et al.,  ; Wendell et al.,  ). However, complex attention, learning and memory, and executive function have been considered especially susceptible domains (van der Flier et al.,  ). Our findings are consistent with this conclusion. They confirm that carotid atherosclerosis is associated with enhanced habitual brain networks in tobacco‐dependent individuals. In the study on the relationship between age and changes in brain activity, the activity of medial frontal and parietal regions increased linearly with age during task execution, whereas task‐related activation of dlPFC decreased with age (Grady et al.,  ). Numerous factors contribute to this outcome, but our results support studies and show atherosclerosis as one of such factors. \n\nOne limitation of this study is the lack of longitudinal studies that compared the dual‐system shift in tobacco dependence of young individuals compared with those in older adults, which further proves the relationship between atherosclerosis and dual‐system changes. Therefore, further research involving tobacco dependence of a young group is needed to confirm our results. Moreover, we did not further compare the smoking groups to determine the relationship between different degrees of atherosclerosis and dual‐system brain networks. We did not further analyze the causal relationship between carotid atherosclerosis and the transformation of dual‐system brain networks, which will be further explored in future studies. \n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nIn conclusion, rs‐fMRI was used to investigate the relationship between tobacco dependence behavior, carotid atherosclerosis, and brain function. The results indicated that the formation of tobacco dependence behavior is related to the transformation of the dual‐system. Carotid atherosclerosis was associated with a shift in FC from a goal‐directed network to a habit network in tobacco dependence. These findings provide insights into the interplay between carotid atherosclerosis and the balance of goal‐directed and habitual networks in tobacco dependence. Although our results require replication in other samples, the relationship between cIMT and the shift of the dual system must be studied to understand the cumulative effects of vascular disease on the brain. Our findings will help future investigations of the effects of the central nervous system on behavioristics and subclinical atherosclerosis. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT \n  \nThe author declares that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported. \n\n\n\n### PEER REVIEW \n  \nThe peer review history for this article is available at  . \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"0c39dbcc6da59a02ae1729e0bbf7ccc7"},

Previous neuroimaging studies have reported altered functional connectivity (FC) in distributed functional networks. However, most neuroimaging studies focused on patients at an advanced stage and with antiparkinsonian medication. This study aims to conduct a cross-sectional study on cerebellar FC changes in early-stage drug-naïve PD patients and its association with motor and cognitive function. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nTwenty-nine early-stage drug-naïve PD patients and 20 healthy controls (HCs) with resting-state fMRI data and motor UPDRS and neuropsychological cognitive data were extracted from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) archives. We used seed-based resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) FC analysis and the cerebellar seeds were defined based on the hierarchical parcellation of the cerebellum (AAL atlas) and its topological function mapping (motor cerebellum and non-motor cerebellum). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe early stage drug-naïve PD patients had significant differences in cerebellar FC when compared with HCs. Our findings include: (1) Increased intra-cerebellar FC within motor cerebellum, (2) increase motor cerebellar FC in inferior temporal gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus within ventral visual pathway and decreased motor-cerebellar FC in cuneus and dorsal posterior precuneus within dorsal visual pathway, (3) increased non-motor cerebellar FC in attention, language, and visual cortical networks, (4) increased vermal FC in somatomotor cortical network, and (5) decreased non-motor and vermal FC within brainstem, thalamus and hippocampus. Enhanced FC within motor cerebellum is positively associated with the MDS-UPDRS motor score and enhanced non-motor FC and vermal FC is negatively associated with cognitive function test scores of SDM and SFT. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThese findings provide support for the involvement of cerebellum at an early stage and prior to clinical presentation of non-motor features of the disease in PD patients. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and the most common movement disorder in elderly population with increasing prevalence from about 1% at age 60 to 4% by age 80 worldwide ( ;  ;  ;  ). PD is often characterized by progressive deterioration of motor function including resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. PD is also involved in non-motor dysfunctions including cognitive impairment, mood disorders, impaired olfaction, hallucination, etc ( ). \n\nResting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), as a non-invasive and task-free tool, has been used to investigate the functional abnormalities and has provided important insights on the pathophysiological mechanisms of various neurodegenerative diseases ( ;  ;  ;  ), including PD ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Given that many of the motor symptoms in PD can be attributed to the loss of dopaminergic neuron in the SNpc ( ), most rs-fMRI studies have focused on the striato-thalamo-cortical pathways. However, several key features of PD, such as non-motor symptoms and the heterogeneity of the disease, cannot be explained adequately by basal ganglia dysfunction alone and is an active area of research ( ;  ). More recently, emerging evidence from multiple converging modalities (anatomical, clinical, pathophysiological and neuroimaging) have shown that the cerebellum may contribute substantially to the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Neuroanatomic and functional studies provided evidences that distinct cerebellum sub-regions receive information from widespread neocortical areas, including portions of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, while the efferent from the cerebellar nuclei projects to multiple subdivisions of the thalamus, which, in turn, project to a myriad of neocortical areas, including premotor, prefrontal, and posterior parietal areas of the cerebral cortex ( ). Moreover, recent findings have shown that the cerebellum and basal ganglia are densely interconnected ( ). Given its anatomical and functional inter-connections with the basal ganglia and much of the cortical cortex, cerebellum not only has influence on motor function, but may also influence a range of higher-order non-motor functions ( ;  ). \n\nPrevious rs-fMRI studies have reported altered cerebellar FC in PD patients and its association with motor and cognitive test scores ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ). Altered FC between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks, including the sensorimotor, dorsal attention, default networks, and frontoparietal network, have been observed in PD patients compared to normal controls ( ;  ). However, most of the rs-fMRI studies of cerebellum have focused on patients with moderate or advanced stages of PD who were treated with anti-parkinsonian medication. Acute and chronic use of levodopa has been shown to modify the PD-induced changes in local neural activity and FC in patients with PD ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). As such, it is often unclear whether the results of these PD studies are due to the disease, medication being used, or a combination of both factors. Moreover, only very few studies reported that altered cerebellar FC and FC between the “motor” cerebellum and SMA was positively correlated with motor scores, while intra-cerebellar connectivity was positively correlated with cognitive scores in PD patients with cognitive impairment ( ). It becomes important to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PD at an early stage and without medication administration. \n\nIn this study, we aimed to study the change of cerebellar FC in early stage drug-naïve PD patients. In particular, we sought to determine the specific pattern of FC changes that occur across the motor, non-motor, and vermis regions of the cerebellum in order to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms that may, independently from treatment-related side effects, generate the key motor and cognitive symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease. We used the anatomic atlas of cerebellum as seed regions and performed seed-based rs-fMRI analysis to investigate FC changes between cerebellar sub-regions and cortical and subcortical brain regions. We also evaluated the association of cerebellar FC with motor and cognitive function assessments among the PD patients. \n\n\n## Methods and materials \n  \n### Participants \n  \nData used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database  and only early stage drug-naïve PD patients with available rs-fMRI data were included in this study. Initially, we identified 102 PD patients who had one or more rs-fMRI scans. Among them, however, only 33 PD patients (20 males and 13 females, aged between 38 ~ 75 years old, and 11 ~ 22 years of education) obtained at least one rs-fMRI scan before the initiation of PD treatment. All the 33 PD patients had at least two of the following symptoms: resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, or either asymmetric resting tremor or asymmetric bradykinesia and at Hoehn and Yahr Stage I or II (without impairment of posture balance). These PD patients were normal or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) assessed by Global Cognitive Test of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The cutoff MoCA score to differentiate normal cognition and MCI was set as 26. No patients had any atypical PD syndromes due to drugs or metabolic disorders, encephalitis, or other neurodegenerative diseases. A cohort of 22 age-and education-matched HC participants (17 males and 5 females, aged between 40 and 79 years old, and 13–22 years of education) were extracted from PPMI too. For both PD patients and HC participants, the first available rs-fMRI data was used. \n\n\n### MDS-unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale test for motor function \n  \nThe Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is used to evaluate the severity and progression of PD among patients ( ). The MDS-UPDRS Part III Motor Score provides a comprehensive evaluation of motor function covering speech, facial expression, muscle rigidity, tremor (rest, posture, and kinetic), gait, posture instability, etc. It includes 18 items resulting in 33 scores by location and lateralization. Each score has five response options, ranging from 0 ~ 4 representing normal, slight, mild, moderate, and severe. The maximum of the sum of all the scores is 132. Higher score indicates more severe impairment. \n\n\n### Neuropsychological cognitive function test \n  \nThe major cognitive function test was conducted using Global Cognitive Test of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). In addition, a comprehensive neuropsychological battery assessment in five cognitive domains was also administrated: (1) Hopkins Vernal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT) for verbal memory, (2) Benton Judgment of Line Orientation (BJLO, using one of the two short form with 15 items) for visuospatial function, (3) Semantic Fluency Tests (SFT) including animal, vegetable and fruit categories for executive function, (4) WMS-III Letter-Number Sequencing Test (LNST) for working memory, and (5) Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDM) for attention, perceptual speed, motor speed, and visual scanning. In this study, the assessment time of the used cognitive scores were marked as the same as that of the used rs-fMRI data (the recording time difference between the assessment and imaging were about ±1 month). \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nStandardized MRI protocols were used for brain structural and functional scans on 3 T Siemens Tim Trio MR scanner. The high resolution isotropic 3D T1 structural images were acquired in sagittal orientation using a MPRAGE GRAPPA protocol and imaging parameters of repetition time (TR) = 2,300 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.98 ms, flip angle (FA) = 9 , field of view (FOV) = 240 × 256 mm , and voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm . The rs-fMRI BOLD images were acquired in axial direction using a T2* weighted single shot EPI sequence with imaging parameters of TR = 2,400 ms, TE = 25 ms, FA = 80 , FOV = 222 × 222 mm , voxel size = 3.294 × 3.294 × 3.3 mm , with a total of 210 EPI volumes. The participants were instructed to remain quiet, with their eyes open and not fall asleep throughout the rs-fMRI scan. \n\n\n### MRI data preprocessing and denoising \n  \nThe structural MRI and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data were preprocessed using the CONN toolbox (version 18) ( , RRID: SCR_009550). The preprocessing steps for the structural T1-MPRAGE images involved normalization to the MNI152 template space with a spatial resolution of 1x1x1 mm  and simultaneous segmentation into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) using the prior tissue probability distribution map ( ). \n\nFor the rs-fMRI data, the preprocessing steps included motion estimation and correction through realignment and unwarp, slice timing correction, artifact detection using the ART method, simultaneous segmentation of GM/WM/CSF, normalization to the standard MNI template with a resolution of 2x2x2 mm , and spatial smoothing with a 6 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. During the artifact detection preprocessing step, quality control (QC) timeseries were computed, including Global Signal Change (GSC) and Framewise Displacement (FD). These QC measures were used to assess and monitor the data quality and the impact of motion-related artifacts ( ). The outlier volumes were identified for scubbing. \n\nFurther denoising steps included linear regression, band filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz), and detrending to minimize the presence of non-neural noise and residual head motion effects in the rs-fMRI BOLD signal. The confounds for linear regression included the first five principal components of the average WM and CSF signals, Friston24 motion parameters (six motion realignment parameters and their first-order derivatives, the six quadratic motion realignment parameters and their first-order derivatives), QC time series, and Scrubbing. We also setup realignment measures, QC timeseresis and Scrubbing for further remove motion effect on BOLD signal. The outlier volumes were removed from further FC analysis. \n\nSubsequently, we conducted quality checking as detailed in ( ). We also visually inspected the normalized rs-fMRI data specifically for full cerebellum coverage. As a result, only 29 PD patients and 20 HCs were included in the subsequent cerebellar FC analysis. \n\n\n### Cerebellum seed ROIs \n  \nThe Conn toolbox provides a cerebellum parcellation based on the AAL atlas ( ), which includes 26 subregions, such as lobular III, IV/V, VI, Crus I, Crus II, VIIb, VIII, IX, and X, as well as vermis I/II, III, IV/V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X. However, as the parcellation is based on young healthy population, we manually modified the cerebellar subregions by overlapping them on the averaged normalized structural and resting-state fMRI data to account for cerebellar atrophy in our older population. The final modified subregions, which were overlapped on the averaged normalized T1mprage in this study, are shown in  . Considering previous evidence that the left and right cerebellar hemispheres have distinct functions and connection to lateralized association cortex ( ;  ), we kept the lobular seed ROIs by hemispheres to explore potential lateral differences. Additionally, the vermis seed ROIs were also segregated from lobular seeds since studies have shown that the cerebellar vermis has plays a distinct role in PD ( ). Therefore, a total of 28 cerebellar seed ROIs were used in this study. \n  \nIllustration of the seed ROIs in   (A,B)   motor and non-motor hemispherical cerebellum;   (C)   Vermis. The right and left lobule ROIs were analyzed separately. The mask of all ROIs were extracted from the AAL atlas which was based on the anatomic parcellation of the human cerebellum ( ). \n  \nAccording to topographic function mapping of the human cerebellum, it can be functionally divided into double representations of the motor cerebellum (first = lobules IV/V/VI and second = lobule VIII) and triple representations of the non-motor cerebellum (first = lobules VI/Crus I; second = lobules Crus II/VIIB; and third = lobules IX/X) ( ;  ;  ;  ). Thus, in the results section, we functionally grouped the hemispherical seed ROIs into two categories: -motor and non-motor cerebellum lobular seeds. \n\nDuring the initial data processing stages, we observed strong FC between the neighboring anterior cerebellum and ventral regions of the cerebral cortex, which overshadowed the FC between the cerebellum and other cerebral regions. This effect may be due to the close physical proximity of the anterior cerebellum to ventral regions of the cerebral cortex, leading to a blurring of fMRI signal across the cerebellar-cerebral boundary ( ). This effect may also be caused by head motion even though we applied head motion controls during the preprocessing and Denoising steps. To minimize this effect, we applied an eroded cerebellum mask to confine the anterior cerebellar seeds. \n\n\n### Functional connectivity analysis \n  \nA seed-to-whole brain FC analysis was performed. The averaged time series of all the voxels within the seed ROIs was obtained from the unsmoothed rs-fMRI data to minimize contamination of the signal from neighboring lobules. FC was measured as the Pearson correlation between the averaged time series of a seed ROI and the time series of each voxel in the whole brain from spatially smoothed rs-fMRI data. Fisher z-transformation was then used to convert the correlation coefficients to normally distributed scores, in order to allow second-level general linear model (GLM) analysis. For group comparison analysis, a mixed GLM model was applied to estimate the difference of FC between the PD patients and HCs by controlling for age, gender and years of education. The significance level was set at two-sided voxel-wise uncorrected   p   < 0.005 and a cluster-size false-discovery rate (FDR) corrected   p   < 0.05 for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n### Association analysis between FC and motor and cognitive test scores \n  \nWe conducted association analysis using SPSS 26 to examine the relationship between the z-value of FC in significant clusters of each seed and the total score of MDS-UPDRS III, as well as the scores from the neuropsychological tests. For clusters demonstrating significant FC differences between PD and HC participants, we calculated the average FC of voxels within each cluster. Non-parametric correlations were then performed to assess the associations between FC and MDS-UPDRS III scores, while controlling for age, gender, and education. Additionally, partial correlations were conducted between FC and cognitive test scores, with adjustments made for age, gender, and education. The significance level was set at   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n### Other statistical analysis \n  \nThe group difference in motor and cognitive scores were estimated using the GLM multivariate analysis controlling for age, gender and years of education with SPSS ver26. The significant level was defined as corrected value of   p   <0.05. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and clinical characteristic data \n  \nAs shown in  , a total of 33 early stage drug-naïve PD patients (20 males/13 females, mean age of 59.12 ± 10.71, range of 38 ~ 75 years old) and 22 age and education matched HC participants (17 males/5 females, mean age of 60.99 ± 10.88, range of 40 ~ 79 years old) from the PPMI archives were included in this study. Four patients were excluded for FC analysis due to partial cerebellar coverage. Over 85% of the PD and HC participants were right-hand dominant. For PD patients, about 67% had right-side motor onset. About 97% were at early stage (under Hoehn-Yahr stage 3) with mild symptoms of rest tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. At the initial visit, there was no significant group difference in cognitive function MoCA score between the PD patients and HC participants (PD: 27.30 ± 2.48, HC: PD: 28.18 ± 1.10;   p   = 0.125). Furthermore, 25 PD patients and 20 HC participants had normal cognitive function with MoCA score greater than 26 (mean MoCA of PD = 28.52 and HC = 27.95) and only 8 PD patients and 2 HC participants had mild cognition impairment (MCI) (mean MoCA of PD = 23.5 and HC = 24). \n  \nDemographics and Clinical characteristics for PD patients and HCs. \n  \n\n### Group difference in motor and cognitive function test scores \n  \n shows the results of group comparison in motor and neuropsychological cognitive test scores. The PD patients had significantly higher MDS-UPDRS Part III motor score than the HC participants (PD: 20.42 ± 10.38; HC: 1.55 ± 2.54;   p   < 1e-10). Martinez-Martin et al. had investigated the relationship between the PD severity and MDS-UPDRS score and suggested that the MDS-UPDRS part III score of 29/30 was the cut-off points of between mild and moderate PD ( ). Thus the PD severity of this patient group was very mild. \n  \nMotor and Cognitive Function Comparison between PD patients and HCs. \n  \n*: GLM multivariate analysis with covariates of age, gender, and education, Bonferroni corrected. \n  \nFor the cognitive function tests, PD patients showed significant worse performance only in the SDM test which evaluates the attention, motor speed, and visual scanning functions (HC: 47.14 ± 10.30; PD: 43.39 ± 9.86;   p   < 0.010). No significant group differences were found in other cognitive function tests including HVLT, JLO, LNST, and SFT. It’s interesting to note that the PD patients in this study showed slightly better executive function than the HC participants in the SFT test (SFT animal score: HC: 10.77 ± 2.39; PD: 11.39 ± 3.45; SFT total score (including animal, fruit and vegetable): HC: 48.55 ± 9,85; PD: 50.52 ± 12.09; corrected   p   < 0.027). \n\n\n### Group difference in motor cerebellar lobular FC \n  \nHigher FC between motor cerebellum seeds and cortical cortex brain regions as well as within the cerebellum was observed among PD patients (  and  ). Compared to HCs, PD patients had higher FC between left lobule III and bilateral anterior temporal-fusiform cortex, right posterior temporal-fusiform cortex, right inferior temporal gyrus, and right temporal pole, as depicted by red clusters in  . PD patients had higher FC between left lobule IV/V and left occipital-fusiform gyrus and inferior lateral occipital cortex, as shown in  . PD patients also had higher FC between motor cerebellum seeds and left posterior cerebellum. PD patients demonstrated higher FC between seeds in primary motor cerebellum (left/right lobule III, left/right lobule IV/V) and secondary motor regions located at posterior cerebellum, such as left lobule VIIB and left lobule VIII as shown in  – . FC of right lobule VIII was also found to be higher with left lobule VIII, lobule VII, and Crus II as shown in  . \n  \nFC difference map between the PD patients and HCs of motor cerebellum seeds of   (A,B)   left lobule III and left lobule IV/V;   (C–E)   right lobule III, right lobule IV/V, and right lobule VIII. Two-sided two sample   t  -test was performed with significant level of voxel uncorrected   p   < 0.008 and cluster FDR-corrected   p   < 0.05. Blue color represents FC of PD less than FC of HCs. Red color represents FC of PD greater than FC of HCs. \n  \nReduced FC was observed among PD patients between the anterior motor seed of right lobule III and the left cuneal and precuneus cortex, as depicted by the blue clusters in  . \n\n\n### Group difference in non-motor cerebellar lobular FC \n  \nWide-spread alterations of FC between non-motor cerebellum seeds and frontal lobe, superior parietal and occipital cortex, and inferior temporal and occipital cortex were identified in PD patients (  and  ). For the seeds of left Crus I and right lobule VII, higher FC was observed in the right middle frontal gyrus and frontal pole of PD patients ( , ). The PD had higher FC of right lobule X in the left middle frontal gyrus ( ). For seeds of right lobule VI and right Crus II, PD showed higher FC in left superior lateral parietal gyrus and angular gyrus ( , ). PD also showed higher FC between right lobule VII and bilateral lingual gyrus and left occipital-fusiform gyrus, inferior lateral occipital cortex and occipital cortex. Both the FC of left lobule IX and the FC of right lobule IX in the left occipital-fusiform cortex was found lower in PD patients ( , ), which is involved with the higher processing of visual information. \n  \nFC difference map between the PD patients and HCs of non-motor cerebellum seeds of   (A–D)   left Crus I, left Crus II, left lobule VII, and left lobule IX;   (E–J)   Right lobule VI, right Crus I, right Crus II, right lobule VII, right lobule IX, and right lobule X. Two-sided two sample t-test was performed with significant level of voxel uncorrected   p   < 0.005 and cluster FDR-corrected   p   < 0.05. Blue color represents FC of PD less than FC of HCs. Red color represents FC of PD greater than FC of HCs. \n  \nGroup differences were also found in FC of non-motor cerebellum seeds to subcortical regions. Compared to HC, PD had lower FC between right Crus II and right lobule IX and brainstem ( , ); lower FC of right lobule X with right hippocampus, thalamus, and insular cortex ( ). \n\n\n### Group difference in cerebellar Vermal FC \n  \nAltered cerebellar vermal FC was observed in cerebral cortical cortex (  and  ). Compared to HCs, PD had higher FC between vermis IV/V and left inferior lateral occipital cortex, occipital-fusiform, and the right temporal pole ( ). PD had higher FC of vermis VI, VII, and X to the somatomotor cortical regions. Specifically, higher FC was found between vermis VI and bilateral precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and left superior marginal gyrus ( ); between vermis VII and bilateral supplemental motor area, precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus, and right superior parietal gyrus ( ); between vermis X and left postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and anterior supramarginal gyrus ( ). \n  \nFC difference map between the PD patients and HCs of Vermal cerebellum seeds of   (A)   Vermis IV/V;   (B)   Vermis VI;   (C)   Vermis VII;   (D)   Vermis IX; and   (E)   Vermis X. Two-sided two sample t-test was performed with significant level of voxel uncorrected   p   < 0.005 and cluster FDR-corrected   p   < 0.05. Blue color represents FC of PD less than FC of HCs. Red color represents FC of PD greater than FC of HCs. \n  \nReduced FC in PD was found between vermis IV/V and visual and default mode network (DMN) region of precuneus and left cuneal cortex ( ). Lower FC in PD was found between both the vermis IX and vermis X and visual processing cortical regions of left lingual gyrus and occipital-fusiform gyrus ( , ). Lower FC in PD was also found between vermis VI and vermis X and brainstem ( , ). \n\n\n### Association between MDS-UPDRS III score and cerebellar FC \n  \nSignificant positive correlations between MDS-UPDRS III score and the FC of primary motor cerebellar lobules were observed in PD patients. The PD patients showed that higher MDS-UPDRS III motor scores (i.e., higher motor dysfunction or worse motor function) were associated with increased FC between right lobule III and secondary motor cerebellar lobules of left lobule VIIB and lobule VIII (r = 0.553,   p   = 0.003,  ); and increased FC between left lobule VI/V and left lobule VIIB and lobule VIII (r = 0.408,   p   = 0.038,  ). \n  \nAssociation between FC within significant clusters and UPDRS motor score in PD group.   (A)   Positive correlation for FC of right lobule III in left lobule VII/VIII (PD:   r   = 0.603,   p   = 0.001);   (B)   positive correlation for left lobule IV/V in left lobule VII/VIII (  r   = 0.449,   p   = 0.022). All the enhanced motor cerebellar FC are associated with worse motor performance. Non-parametric correlation with controlling covariates of age, sex and education was utilized and significant level was defined as   p   < 0.05. \n  \n\n### Association between cognitive function test scores and cerebellar FC \n  \nAmong all the cognitive function tests, only SDM and SFT test scores showed significant difference between the PD and HC groups (as shown in  ). Thus, further partial correlation between the SDM and SFT test scores and the cerebellar FC was performed controlling for age, sex, and education and the results were shown in  . \n  \nAssociation between FC within significant clusters and neurophysiological test score in PD group.   (A)   negative correlation between SDM total score and the FC of right Crus II in left sLOC and left AG (PD:   r   = −0.395,   p   = 0.046);   (B)   positive correlation between SDM total score and the FC of right lobule IX in brainstem, right aPaHC, right lobule IX and vermis IX (  r   = 0.455,   p   = 0.019);   (C)   negative correlation between SDM total score and the FC of vermis VI in right PostCG, right PreCG and right SPL (  r   = −0.432,   r   = 0,027);   (D)   negative correlation between SFT total score and the FC of lobule VII in bilateral LG (PD:   r   = −0.406,   p   = 0.039). Partial correlation with controlling of age, sex and education was utilized and significant level was defined as   p   < 0.05. \n  \nBoth significant positive and negative correlation were observed between the cerebellar FC and SDM test scores for attention, perceptual speed, motor speed, and visual scanning. As shown in  , the PD patients had higher FC of right Crus II in the left superior lateral occipital cortex (sLOC) and angular gyrus (AG) which belong to the visual and attention network. The FC of right Crus II was negatively correlated with SDM total score in PD group (r = −0.395,   p   = 0.046) whereas the trend was opposite in the HC group although not significant (r = 0.185,   p   = 0.477) ( ). As shown in  , the PD patients showed higher FC between vermis VI and right PreCG, PostCG and SPL which belong to sensori-motor network and were negatively correlated with SDM total score in both PD group (  r   = −0.432,   p   = 0.027) and HC group (  r   = −0.428,   p   = 0.088) ( ). Significant positive correlation was found between the SDM total score and the FC of right lobule IX in subcortical and its neighboring cerebellar regions including brainstem, right anterior parahippocampal gyrus, right lobule IX, and vermis IX in PD patients group (  r   = 0.455,   p   = 0.019) ( ). \n\nAs shown in  , PD patients showed higher FC of right lobule VII in the left and right lingual gyrus (LG) when compared with HCs. The lingual gyrus is involved in processing of visual information. The PD patients also showed significant negative correlation between the FC of right lobule VII and SFT total score (r = −0.406,   p   = 0.039), indicating that higher FC of right lobule VII in left and right LG was associated with poor executive function. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study aimed to investigate the alteration of cerebellar functional connectivity (FC) patterns among early-stage, drug-naïve PD patients and its relationship to early changes in motor and cognitive function. The existing literature lacks sufficient evidence regarding such alterations in this specific patient population, as most studies have focused on moderate to advanced PD patients receiving treatment. Consequently, it remains unclear whether the reported FC changes are primarily due to the disease itself, the medication used, or a combination of both factors. This study is aimed to address this paucity and our findings revealed several key results. Firstly, we observed increased intra-cerebellar FC between the first and second representations of the motor cerebellum. Additionally, motor-cerebellar FC was enhanced in the ventral visual pathway, specifically in the inferior temporal gyrus and inferior lateral occipital gyrus, while reduced FC was observed in the cuneus and dorsal posterior precuneus within the dorsal visual pathway. Furthermore, we identified increased non-motor cerebellar FC in cortical areas associated with attention, language, and visual networks. Moreover, vermal FC was found to be increased within the somatomotor cortical network. Conversely, we observed decreased FC between non-motor and vermal subdivisions with the brainstem, thalamus, and hippocampus. Furthermore, our association analysis revealed significant correlations between cerebellar FC and clinical measures. Specifically, enhanced FC within the motor cerebellum was positively associated with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score, while increased non-motor and vermal FC showed negative associations with cognitive function test scores, such as the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDM). Overall, our findings provide evidence that cerebellar FC changes are involved in the pathophysiology of PD and highlight the potential of cerebellar FC as a biomarker for early PD diagnosis and monitoring. \n\nMotor Cerebellar FC Changes in early stage drug-naïve PD patients. \n\nPrevious work detailing the general pattern of cerebellar FC has already revealed that there are two somatomotor representations in the cerebellum that are primarily involved in motor processing ( ;  ,  , ). The first somatomotor representation is located at the anterior part of the cerebellum and encompass the lobule I-III, IV and V. The second somatomotor representation is located at the posterior part of the cerebellum and includes the lobule VIII. Previous studies showed that the M1 had FC with both the first representation and second representation although they are anatomically distant ( ;  ). In this study, we found increased intra-cerebellar FC consistent with previous studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Specifically, we found out that enhanced FC between all the subdivisions of the first somatomotor representation (left and right lobule III, left and right lobule IV/V) and the second somatomotor representation on the left side (left lobule VIIb/VIII) in PD patients when compared with HCs. In general, increased levels of cerebellar connectivity were most commonly related with improved performance, supporting the compensatory cerebellum involvement in PD ( ;  ). However, in this study we found out that greater FC between right lobule III and left lobule VIIb/VIII and greater FC between left lobule IV/V and left lobule VIIb/VIII are positively correlated with UPDRS motor score, indicating that greater FC was associated with worse motor performance in the early stage drug-naïve PD patients. To interpret this phenomenon, Festini et al. cited a plausible explanation that at a certain level, reliance on the cerebellum is no longer feasible to compensate for other dysfunctional neural systems (i.e., the striatum), and cerebellar recruitment becomes affiliated with impaired behavior which also been used in healthy cognitive aging, regarding compensatory frontal recruitment ( ). Increased FC between the motor representations and cortical regions were also found in this study. Unlike previous studies which showed enhanced FC between cerebellar motor lobules or cerebellar sensorimotor network (SMN) and the cortical somatomotor regions in PD patients ( ;  ), we did not obverse significant motor cerebellar FC changes in the somatomotor cortical regions in the early stage drug-native PD patients. Instead, increased motor cerebellar FC was observed in the left and right inferior temporal lobe (including right inferior temporal gyrus, right temporo-fusiform cortex, right temporal pole, left temopro-fusiform cortex, left occipito-fusiform gyrus) and left inferior lateral occipital cortex (iLOC) which is located in the ventral visual stream involving the higher processing of visual information for the purpose of visual perception ( ). Visuomotor impairment is often found in PD patients ( ), and it is associated with basal ganglia dysfunction and the reduced function of other motor brain regions that connect to basal ganglia such as motor cortex and cerebellum ( ). Our finding may indicate that the cerebellum may be involved in the visuomotor control and the enhanced FC between the motor cerebellum and ventral visual pathway may suggest the compensatory effect of the cerebellum to maintain the visuomotor function in the early stage drug-naïve PD patients. \n\nReduced FC was found between one of the subdivisions of motor cerebellum (right lobule III) and left cuneus and dorsal posterior precuneus (dorsal visual stream), which is involved in basic visual processing ( ;  ;  ). This reduced FC may be an early sign of pathophysiological changes associated with visuomotor function impairment in the early stage drug-naïve PD patients. \n\n### Non-motor cerebellar FC changes in early stage drug-naïve PD patient \n  \nResting-state and task fMRI studies have shown that cerebellum is activated in relation to non-motor functions, such as language, spatial processing, working memory, executive function, and emotional processing, and revealed a triple non-motor representations (first = VI/Crus I, second = Crus II/VIIb, third = IX/X) along with detailed topological functional gradient mapping of the cerebellum ( ;  ;  ). Meanwhile, many studies have shown that cerebellum, together with the basal ganglia, is involved in both motor and non-motor functions in PD ( ). Consistent with previous studies, our results demonstrated wide-spread increased FC between subdivisions of non-motor cerebellum and their corresponding functional cortical regions covering attention network, language network, and visual network. For example, we observed that left Crus I and right lobule VII showed greater FC in right middle frontal gyrus and right frontal pole which is the convergence cortical area of the ventral attention network and dorsal attention network. This is consistent with previous resting-state fMRI studies which revealed that Crus I is cerebellum representation of dorsal attention network and lobule VII is the cerebellum representation of ventral attention network. Based on task fMRI imaging studies, the language processing task activated the lobule VI and Crus I/II ( ) and a cerebellar-occipital-fusiform-thalamic network centered around bilateral lingual gyrus for word association was identified ( ). Our results showed that right lobule VI and right Crus II had greater FC in left superior lateral occipital cortex (sLOC) and left angular gyrus (AG) which is involved in object recognition and higher language processing. We also found enhanced FC of right lobule VII with left primary visual cortex (left inferior lateral occipital cortex and occipital pole) and left ventral visual stream (left occipito-fusiform gyrus, and bilateral lingual gyrus). Especially, the FC of right lobule VII with bilateral lingual gyrus is significantly negatively associated with sematic fluency test (SFT) score, which indicates that enhanced FC is associated with better executive function for word associated task. The FC of right Crus II is significantly negatively associated with SDM test score for the integrated function of attention, motor speed, and visual scanning. Taken together these findings demonstrate that the changed non-motor cerebellar FC may contribute to the cognitive function impairment in early stage drug-naïve PD patients. \n\n\n### Greater Vermal FC in sensorimotor cortical network \n  \nIn this study, we intentionally separated the vermis from the hemispherical lobules of the cerebellum and investigated whether the vermis had unique role in PD. The vermis, as part of spinocerebellum, classically is thought to receive somatic sensory, visual, and auditory inputs   via   ascending spinal pathways and has intimate connections with other parts of cerebellum ( ). Recently, the cerebellar vermis was found to have projections from motor areas of cerebral cortex ( ). In this study, the most pronounced greater FC from vermis subdivisions (Vermis VI, VII, and X) was found in the sensorimotor cortical areas including the bilateral primary motor cortex (PreCG), bilateral primary somatosensory cortex (PostCG), bilateral supplemental motor cortex (SMA), and left supramarginal gyrus. It’s noted that only the vermis, not the hemispherical lobular subdivisions, had significantly greater FC with sensorimotor cortical network and the resulting greater FC from the vermal FC which shifts from being negative in HCs to more positive in the early stage drug-naïve PD patients. Similarly, Maiti et al., revealed that increased vermal FC (using entire vermis as a seed) with the sensorimotor cortices, in the absence of relevant vermal or cortical atrophy, may predict future gait impairment, one of the motor symptoms in PD ( ). Furthermore, our association analysis shows that, in early stage drug-naïve PD patients, the FC between vermis VI and right PreCG and right PostCG was significantly negatively correlated with the Symbol-Digit Modalities test (SDM) which involves an integrated function of attention, perceptual speed, motor speed, and visual scanning ( ). The greater FC is associated with worse performance in SDM test which might be an indicator of pathophysiological process of cognitive and motor deficit in PD patients. \n\n\n### Decreased lobular FC and vermal FC in brainstem \n  \nAnother one of the intriguing findings in this study was the decreased FC between several subdivisions (right Crus II, right lobule IX, vermis VII, vermis IX, and vermis X) of the cerebellum and the brainstem ( ,  ). Previous post-mortem studies showed that brainstem plays an important role in PD by revealing that pathological changes in PD first appear primarily in the brainstem with loss of serotonergic and cholinergic neurons and with subsequent progression to substantia nigra pars compacta with prominent loss of dopaminergic neurons ( ;  ;  ). A resting-state fMRI FC study of the striatum demonstrated reduced FC between the striatum and extended brainstem reinforcing the importance of the brainstem in the pathophysiology of PD ( ). Our findings of reduced FC between cerebellum and brainstem, together with reduced FC between cerebellum and thalamus and hippocampus ( , ), further supports the idea that both the cerebellum and brainstem contribute to the pathophysiology process of PD. \n\nAltogether, our results demonstrated both increased and reduced cerebellar FC in the early stage drug-naïve PD patients when compared with HCs and their association with the motor and non-motor function scores further support the idea that the cerebellum plays an important role in PD even at early stage. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nPPMI database has about one hundred of robust and reliable longitudinal resting-state fMRI data of PD patients at the time of writing this manuscript. However, the sample size for newly diagnosed drug-naïve PD patients is still limited. In order to include more drug-naïve PD patients, we obtained the rs-fMRI and behavioral data not only at baseline but also from other time points when no PD-related medication treatment was yet administrated. Thus even though 70% of the early stage PD patients were newly diagnosed with PD duration less than 6 months, the PD duration at the chosen visit of rs-fMRI scan was extended to 33 months. As the number of participants increases for the PPMI study it would be of interest to see if the findings from this study still hold on a more homogenous data from initial diagnosis. Future studies should focus on the long-term status of cerebellar connectivity changes as the disease progresses. \n\nAnother limitation is that we used the anatomic parcellation of the cerebellum according to the AAL atlas ( ) which may not well reflect the functional segregation of the cerebellum. For example, cerebellar lobule V is involved in both motor and cognitive function. Future studies may be conducted in a functionally defined cerebellar atlas ( ;  ). \n\nFurthermore, it is important to acknowledge that our analysis examining the association between functional connectivity (FC) and behavior did not account for two significant factors: PD disease duration and cortical/cerebellum atrophy, both of which are known to be important considerations. Disease duration was not included as a covariate in our analysis because it was not found to be correlated with MDS-UPDRS III and cognitive scores in these early-stage, drug-naïve PD patients. Additionally, cortical/cerebellum atrophy was not included as a controlling covariate because we already included age as a covariate, which is known to be associated with cortical/cerebellar atrophy. But this might be a potential limitation of this study. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nCerebellar FC in early stage drug-naïve PD patients has not received much attention. We have demonstrated multiple changes of FC including those related to motor and cognition within the cerebellum and various brain cortical/subcortical regions in early stage drug-naïve PD patients. Our findings, while reflective of early symptoms of PD, also suggest a possible compensatory mechanism to maintain the visuomotor function. More studies are required to confirm our findings and to investigate the pathophysiological changes in cerebellar connectivity in PD. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Data used in the preparation of the manuscript were obtained from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database ( ).
