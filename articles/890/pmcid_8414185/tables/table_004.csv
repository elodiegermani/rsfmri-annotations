[???],ICA based RSFC comparison before and after speech therapy.,"P < 0.05, corrected by Monte Carlo simulation, individual voxel p < 0.001, cluster volume>327 mm3.",13 controls (24)15 PDS (24),RSFC was decreased in the cerebellum after therapy to the level of fluent controls.
[???],ROI-based RSFC,"P < 0.05, corrected by family-wise error (FWE) and cluster size <35 voxels.",46 controls (25.2)44 PDS (25.4),"Reduced FC between the posterior language reception area and anterior brain regions related to initiation of speech motor, but increased FC within anterior/posterior speech associated regions in the PDS group"
[???],Seed-voxel based RSFC,voxel-wise p < 0.005 uncorrected with cluster size >64 voxels correspondingto p < 0.03 whole brain corrected using Monte Carlo simulation.,18 control (24.7)16 PDS (26.3),"Decreased connectivity between the basal ganglia and right SMA, as well as bilateral STG, but increased connectivity between the cerebellum and right IFG in the PDS group"
[???],Seed-voxel based RSFC,voxel-based p < 0.005 was corrected to be an equivalent whole-brain p < 0.032,29 controls (6.4)27 stuttering children (6.4),"Reduced FC in networks that support self-initiated timing of speech movement, and integration of auditory feedback to speech motor control processes in stuttering children"
[???],ROI-based RSFC,uncorrected threshold of p < 0.033,19 control (24.5)20 PDS (25.5),"Increased FC between cerebellum and thalamus, but decreased FC within the perisylvian auditory, motor, and speech planning regions in the PDS group"
Our study,Seed-voxel based RSFC,"Voxel-wise p < 0.001 uncorrected, cluster p < 3.76×10−4FDR corrected",15 controls (25.7)15 PDS (27.9),"Decreased FC between MidFGl and right motor areas, as well as between STGl and several brain regions including the right limbic lobe and right cerebellum in the PDS subjects"
