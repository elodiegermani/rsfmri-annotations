???,15 FoG+17 FoG-8 HC,OFF,"UPDRS, CLOX, FAB, MoCa, TMT, and new FoG-QFoG- had worse MoCa scores",Single vs dual task turning in place with wearable inertial sensors.Cross-sectionalCorrelational (direct with real-time gait measures and indirect with NFoG-Q & visuospatial scores),"Activation of the PFC: higher in single turning, and lower in dual-task turning (C/T FoG- & HC).Single turning: Higher PFC activation in FoG+ is linked to higher FoG ratio & worse visuospatial abilities",Executive DysfunctionAND/ORPerceptualDysfunction
???,40 FoG+,ON and OFF,"LEDD, MMSE, UPDRS-III, global cognitive tests, and new FoG-Q",Single vs dual task walking with wearable inertial sensors.Comparative (medication state) Correlational (direct with real-time gait measures),Single task: higher PFC activation in the ON relative to the OFF condition.Dual task: no increase in PFC activation in the ON relative to the OFF condition,Executive Dysfunction
???,68 PD 38 (older) HC,ON,"H&Y, MMSE, UPDRS, FSST, tests of executive functions, attention & visuospatial processing, and 2 min walking test.PD had lower scores on MMSE and all cognitive tests","Regular walking, dual task (DT) walking, and obstacle avoidanceCross-sectionalCorrelational (direct with real-time gait measures)","Higher PFC activation during usual walking (C/T HC) and during obstacle avoidance (C/T to usual walking).Higher PFC activation in PD was positively correlated with higher gait speed during OA, and lower PFC activity was correlated with more severe disease symptoms during usual walking & obstacle avoidance.",Executive Dysfunction
???,12 PD,ON,"H&Y, MMSE, PAQ, and FES-I","Walking while counting forward, serially subtracting, and reciting digit spans.Correlational (direct with real-time gait measures)",Higher activation in bilateral PFC during walking while subtracting and reciting digit spans compared to rest,Executive Dysfunction
???,17 PD-PIGD19 PD-TD,ON,"MMSE, UPDRS, and TMT",Regular walking and obstacle avoidanceCross-sectionalCorrelational (direct with real-time gait measures),PD-PIGD: higher bilateral PFC activity in all conditions (C/T PD-TD).A higher activation in right PFC in both groups during obstacle avoidance (C/T regular walking),Executive Dysfunction
???,18 PD18 HC,ON,"H&Y, LEDD, UPDRS-III, BDI, DSST, FES-I, MoCa, PMT, TMT, Stroop and Bells test.PD performed worse on the TMT, PMT, and Stroop word tasks","Standing while subtracting, regular and dual task walking (subtracting, counting forward) with wearable inertial sensorsCross-sectionalCorrelational (direct with real-time gait measures and indirect with TMT, DSST & Stroop test)",PD had higher DLPFC activity during regular walking and walking while subtracting. Higher DLPFC activity correlated with high gait variability during regular walking & walking while counting forward.,Executive Dysfunction
???,19 FoG-,"OFF and ON– levodopa-placebo, or ON-levodopa-donepezil","H&Y, LEDD, MMSE, UPDRS-III, CLOX, CRT, FAB, MoCa, SRT, TMT, and FoG-Q (FoG+ were excluded).",Single and dual task walking. Comparative (medication state)Correlational (direct with real-time gait measures),Lower PFC activity in ON-levodopa condition (C/T OFF). Higher PFC activity in ON-levodopa-donepezil (C/T OFF) correlated with better gait measures and accuracy during dual task,Executive Dysfunction
???,20 PD,ON,"H&Y, LEDD, UPDRS-III and MoCa",Over-ground walking vs treadmill walking with wearable inertial sensors.Correlational (direct with real-time gait measures),Treadmill walking was associated with lower activation in the PFC and a higher gait stability (C/T regular walking),Perceptual Dysfunction
