          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Advanced imaging modalities have helped elucidate the cerebral alterations associated with neurological impairment caused by degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), but it remains unknown how brain functional network changes at different stages of myelopathy severity in DCM patients, and if patterns in network connectivity can be used to predict transition to more myelopathic stages of DCM.</p>

          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>This pilot cross-sectional study, which involves the collection of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) images and the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score, enrolled 116 participants (99 patients and 17 healthy controls) from 2016 to 2021. The patient cohort included 21patients with asymptomatic spinal cord compression, 48 mild DCM patients, and 20 moderate or severe DCM patients. Functional connectivity networks were quantified for all participants, and the transition matrices were quantified to determine the differences in network connectivity through increasingly myelopathic stages of DCM. Additionally, a link prediction model was used to determine whether more severe stages of DCM can be predicted from less symptomatic stages using the transition matrices.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Findings</title>
          <p>Results indicated interruptions in most connections within the sensorimotor network in conjunction with spinal cord compression, while compensatory connectivity was observed within and between primary and secondary sensorimotor regions, subcortical regions, visuospatial regions including the cuneus, as well as the brainstem and cerebellum. A link prediction model achieved an excellent predictive performance in estimating connectivity of more severe myelopathic stages of DCM, with the highest area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.927 for predicting mild DCM from patients with asymptomatic spinal cord compression.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Interpretation</title>
          <p>A series of predictable changes in functional connectivity occur throughout the stages of DCM pathogenesis. The brainstem and cerebellum appear highly influential in optimizing sensorimotor function during worsening myelopathy. The link predication model can inclusively estimate brain alterations associated with myelopathy severity.</p>

Advanced imaging modalities have helped elucidate cerebral alterations associated with neurological impairment caused by DCM, with increasing evidence suggests that neural plasticity through brain reorganization acts to preserve function in DCM patients.</p><p id="para0007">We searched PubMed from January 2014, to December 2021, for relevant articles in English relating to brain functional connectivity associated with progressive myelopathy in DCM patients. Search terms included: “progressive degenerative cervical myelopathy”, “asymptomatic cervical spondylosis myelopathy”, “fMRI”, “brain functional network”, “brain functional connectivity”, “graph theory”, “link prediction”, “severity of degenerative cervical myelopathy prediction”. Previous studies have reported altered functional connectivity with within sensorimotor regions as a response to DCM, but no study has analyzed the brain functional network in asymptomatic DCM patients. We have also found that majority of studies associated functional connectivity changes with symptom severity evaluated by mJOA score, but no study has characterized the cortical pattern of functional brain network at different stages of myelopathy severity, ranging from asymptomatic spinal cord compression (mJOA=18) myelopathy to moderate/severe myelopathy (mJOA≤14), and it remains unknown if patterns in network connectivity be used to predict transition to more myelopathic stages of DCM. Additionally, some studies have suggested that the brain helps to compensate for functional deficits during progressive stages of DCM, but the importance of cerebellum and brainstem has been understudied.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="para0008">This study examined and characterized the cerebral patterns of the functional connectivity network for each stage of DCM symptom severity, as well as healthy controls and those with asymptomatic spinal cord compression. Results demonstrate that a series of predictable changes in functional connectivity occur as DCM patients transition from asymptomatic spinal cord compression through moderate/severe myelopathy. Interestingly, the brainstem and cerebellum appear highly influential in optimizing sensorimotor function during worsening myelopathy. The study also established a link prediction model based on a graph embedding method and a light GBM algorithm to estimate strengthening and/or weakening functional connectivity during transition from one stage of DCM severity to the next. The ROC AUC for transitions between symptomatic DCM stages ranged from 0.884 to 0.927, with the highest AUC for predicting mild from asymptomatic DCM.</p></sec><sec id="sec0003"><title>Implications of all of the available evidence</title><p id="para0009">This is the first cross-sectional observational study to characterize brain functional networks in DCM patients with varying degrees of myelopathy severity; and use the functional connectivity within the functional brain network exhibited during a particular myelopathy stage of DCM to estimate the network present in the next stage with higher symptom severity. The study has also evidenced a widespread cerebral network differences between the healthy and the asymptomatic stage, which may serve as an important predictive biomarker for monitoring DCM. Neurological function appears preserved through large-scale cerebral plasticity in cases of increased severity of myelopathy, and compensatory input from subcortical regions undergoes adaptations in response to increasing neurological deterioration. The proposed link predication model can inclusively estimate brain changes associated with myelopathy severity by both adding and removing connections within the functional network. Network features extracted via graph embedding method can contribute to future automated modeling by using a graph convolution network in simulating results of other image modalities, classifying myelopathy severity, predicting surgical outcomes, and monitoring disease progression.</p></sec><notes notes-type="alt-text" specific-use="for-accessibility" id="alte1"><p>Alt-text: Unlabelled box</p></notes></boxed-text>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="para0010">Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of spinal cord impairment in patients over the age of 55, often with profound negative effects on their quality of life.<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Progressive degeneration of the cervical spinal canal can lead to spinal cord compression and ultimately degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), manifesting as gait disturbance, limb dyscoordination, and sensory abnormalities. Damage to cervical neurons travelling both to and from the brain affects upstream cerebral structural and functional networks.</p>
      <p id="para0011">Increasing evidence suggests neural plasticity through brain reorganization acts to preserve function in DCM patients.<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Using functional MRI, studies have showed widespread adaptive changes in bilateral primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor area, cingulate motor area, parietal cortex, and contralateral primary somatosensory cortex in cases of spinal cord injury and cervical compressive myelopathy due to spondylosis.<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Additionally, increased functional connectivity within sensorimotor networks, as well as decreased functional connectivity between subcortical regions and frontal lobe executive regions were found to be associated with worsened neurological impairment in DCM.<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> However, most of these studies capture specific regional differences, but do not examine the global patterns in brain function with the goal of predicting severity of myelopathy. Thus, novel methods are needed to analyze and understand the entire brain functional network, which may be useful for predicting disease progression, understanding which brain regions are involved in adaptation and compensation, and predicting post-surgical outcomes.</p>
      <p id="para0012">A promising approach for modeling whole brain connectivity changes is the “<italic>link prediction model</italic>”, in which alterations in “links” within the network are predicted based on features intrinsic to the network itself.<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> This technique has previously been applied to social and biological networks, and more recently to brain network alterations in Alzheimer's disease.<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> We theorize that a link prediction model may be of significant value for describing brain connectivity in patients with DCM, as we hypothesize brain networks are continuously evolving as myelopathic symptoms intensify. Therefore, the current study characterized brain functional networks in healthy controls, asymptomatic patients with spinal cord compression, and DCM patients with varying degrees of myelopathy severity. We then used a link prediction model to quantify whole brain connectivity at different stages of myelopathy severity, as defined by their modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score. We hypothesized sensorimotor regions would drive widespread network changes in the brain associated with worsening myelopathic severity. We also theorized that subcortical regions would be the first to exhibit functional reorganization associated with neurological deterioration, presumably to preserve sensorimotor function. Lastly, we postulated that functional connectivity within the functional brain network exhibited during a particular symptomatic stage of DCM could be estimated from the network present in the preceding stage with lower symptom severity using a link prediction model.</p>

        <p id="para0018">Characterizing the FCNs associated with varying degrees of myelopathy severity requires matrices containing information of FCs strengthening and/or weakening during transition from one stage of DCM severity to the next. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, after verifying that the FC distribution of each stage was approximately normal, matrices containing the transition information were computed by performing unpaired t-tests (with age included as a covariate) between FCNs at each stage, defined as the <italic>healthy control stage, asymptomatic SCC stage, mild DCM stage</italic> and the <italic>moderate/severe DCM stage</italic>. When results failed to show statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), this was interpreted no change in connectivity between the two stages. For statistical differences in FCs between two stages, the mean FC was calculated for the two diagnostic stages.

Light GBM is an ensemble algorithm, which uses a special type of decision trees, also called weak learners, to capture complex, non-linear patterns. To prevent model from overfitting, early stopping is enabled for light GBM if the predictions haven't improved for the last 50 rounds (appendix p 2). The AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) was used to evaluate the model performance, where higher AUC indicates better performance of the link prediction model in classifying FCs associated with sequential DCM stages.</p>

        <p id="para0024">In healthy control volunteers (appendix p 4), 23 brain regions were identified as brain hubs, which corresponded to anatomic locations known to be important role in maintaining sensorimotor function. In the transition from healthy control to asymptomatic SCC (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a-b), 89 connections between the cerebellum and the brainstem as well as thalamus were strengthened, while 58 connections between the frontal lobe and the thalamus and supplementary regions were weakened. These changes in connectivity were driven by alterations in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG r), the left precentral gyrus (PreCG l), bilateral thalamus, the left putamen, the left SMA, regions responsible for visual input and spatial navigation, and several subregions of cerebellum and brainstem.<fig id="fig0002"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Patterns of functional connectivity (FC) during transition from (<bold>a</bold>) healthy control, (<bold>b</bold>) asymptomatic SCC (mJOA = 18), (<bold>c</bold>) mild DCM (15 ≤ mJOA ≤ 17), (d) to moderate/severe DCM (mJOA ≤ 14).

        <p id="para0025">When examining asymptomatic SCC patients (appendix p 5), 20 brain regions were identified as brain hubs within the functional network, corresponding to bilateral PreCG and the anterior cingulate (AC), as well as subregions located in cerebellum. During transition from asymptomatic SCC to DCM with mild myelopathy (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B-C), the connectivity corresponding to 85 connections with the cerebellum were strengthened, while connectivity in 94 connections between the cerebellum and the AC, right PreCG, bilateral SFG and SMA were weakened.

      <p id="para0028">In the past decade, upstream morphological abnormalities,<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and functional connectivity within sensorimotor regions as a response to spinal cord injury have been widely studied.<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Consistent with these previous findings, we were able to confirm that large-scale functional network reorganization occurs in patients with DCM by characterizing the connectivity patterns associated with varying degrees of functional impairment in patients with DCM. These findings are consistent with previous reports demonstrating degenerative motor and sensory function,<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> widespread cortical atrophy,<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and abnormal cerebral network connectivity in patients with DCM,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> dependent on symptom severity.</p>
      <p id="para0029">Results suggest that during asymptomatic SCC, when the spinal cord is compressed but the patient is not experiencing the typical symptoms of upper motor neuron damage caused by spinal cord compression,<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> connections between the thalamus and sensorimotor network are interrupted, while new connections are strengthened between brainstem, subcortical regions, visuospatial areas, and regions within the cerebellum. The strengthening of connectivity observed between the cuneus and precentral gyrus suggests visual input may be used in assisting postural control and preserving motor function during initial stages of cord compression, while the strengthened connectivity between cerebellum and thalamus may indicate greater input from the cerebellothalamic tract, a fiber pathway responsible for motor adaptation and transmitting information for the sensory system.<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Additionally, the right SFG, the left PreCG, the left putamen, the left SMA and bilateral thalamus were identified as altered hub regions, suggesting asymptomatic spinal cord compression may in fact be resulting in chronic damage to sensorimotor neurons.<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
      <p id="para0030">As asymptomatic SCC transitions to mild DCM, a decrease in connectivity was observed between the cerebellum, brainstem, SMA and primary motor cortex, as well as the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate, thalamus, and cuneus. Together, this suggests possible white matter impairment to the bilateral corticospinal tracts extending through the corona radiata associated with the neurological deterioration.<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> While connectivity between these regions decreased dramatically, connectivity <italic>within</italic> the cerebellum and between the brainstem and cerebellum appeared to strengthen. This was particularly the case between the cerebellar vermis, and subregions including the cerebellar second motor representation (lobule VIII) and cerebellar third non-motor representations (lobule X). The spinocerebellular tract, part of the cerebellar vermis, acts to receive somatosensory input from ascending spinal pathways, as well as associated bodily posture and locomotion information.<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> The cerebellar second motor representation (lobule VIII) tends to be engaged in motor processes that require high attention, but less involved in pure motor information processing. Additionally, evidence suggests the cerebellar second motor representation might share functional similarities with the cerebellar third nonmotor representation.<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Together, this suggests increased cerebellar connectivity may serve in a compensatory capacity to preserve sensorimotor function in response to initial stages of neurological deterioration in DCM.</p>
      <p id="para0031">As mild DCM evolves to moderate/severe DCM, connectivity directly between the cerebellum and thalamus, sensorimotor areas, and frontal lobe strengthened sharply, and connectivity with the brainstem and within the cerebellum itself weakened. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that neurological function is preserved through large-scale cerebral plasticity in cases of increased severity of myelopathy, and that compensatory input from subcortical regions undergo adaptations in response to neurological deterioration. Previous studies have proposed that upper motor cortex neurons influence the spinal cord circuits by two routes: direct projections to the spinal cord via the corticospinal pathway, and indirect projections to brainstem centers via the corticoreticulospinal pathway.<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> It is possible that during worsening myelopathy, patients may exhaust their localized functional compensatory mechanisms via the cerebellum, then subsequent adaptations are recruited to optimize residual neurological function and sustain motor behavior performance. This hypothesis is further supported by the observed reduction in the number of cortical regions identified as brain hubs during the more severe myelopathic stages of DCM, while several subregions of cerebellum and brainstem still maintained their influential role within these networks. Importantly, DCM patients with moderate/severe myelopathy have a greater number and severity of symptoms,<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> and surgical guidelines have strongly recommended surgery for this cohort, whereas mild DCM can be treated nonoperatively.<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Therefore, understanding the transition between mild and moderate/severe DCM has direct clinical implications.</p>
      <p id="para0032">Graph analyses and corresponding algorithms have been widely used to understand the structure of functional brain networks by predicting future relationships and missing connections.<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> One group has also utilized the link prediction model to estimate brain network changes in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Rather than computing the node neighborhood similarity score using popular algorithms such as Common Neighbors (CN) and Preferential Attachments (PA) for direct use of graph vector features for each node,<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> the current study implemented graph embedding and extracted vector features of each node.<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Graph embedding learns low-dimensional representations for nodes in a graph, which is able to capture information about the surrounding nodes other than the node itself. These features can also benefit future automated modeling via a graph convolution network<xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> to classify myelopathy severity, predict surgical outcomes, and monitor disease progression. Results out of the link prediction model highlighted the transition from asymptomatic SCC to mild DCM as having the strongest classification performance, whereas the transition from mild to moderate/severe DCM was the least predictive. This may be the case because previous studies have suggested link prediction models work best when the functional network has fewer changes at each stage,<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> implying the transition from asymptomatic SCC to mild DCM may be subtle. This is consistent with previous studies showing that patients with significant spinal cord compression do not always have corresponding symptoms, in part due to supraspinal compensatory mechanisms.<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref></p>

        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p id="para0033">It is important to note that the performance of the link prediction model is highly dependent on sample size. Future study with a larger group of severe DCM patients will allow for better stratification of the moderate/severe group, although this is partially mitigated as these patients are treated similarly from a clinical perspective. Future investigation utilizing comparisons between the mJOA subscores and the brain functional connectivity network could provide additional insights into the neural plasticity associated with DCM. Although the statistical analysis of connectivity differences between patients and the healthy control volunteer cohort accounted for the variation in age of each patient, inclusion of additional older healthy control volunteers would be useful in improving the performance of the predictive model. Furthermore, the matrix representing each DCM stage was calculated by binarizing functional connectivity correlation matrix. Although the current study iterated 1000 times over matrices representing differences between DCM stages until reaching a steady state solution, a more comprehensive algorithm that includes the weight of ROI-to-ROI connections would likely benefit the characterization of network representing each DCM state, thus the outcomes of the link prediction model. Finally, continuous collection of longitudinal imaging that tracks disease progression of individual patients is necessary to validate the current cross sectional model. This could also provide more information about impact of symptom duration on supraspinal reorganization. In addition, there is a small subset of DCM patients that improve neurologically with nonoperative treatment, and a longitudinal study design would allow for further investigation into this group. Lastly, we theorize a combination of structural and functional connectivity patterns could be employed to further understand how the brain compensates for neurological impairment during progressive DCM.</p>
        <p id="para0034">To summarize, a series of well defined, predictable changes in brain functional connectivity occur during DCM pathogenesis. Additionally, the proposed link prediction model may be beneficial in future studies for monitoring disease progression and/or predicting treatment response in patients with DCM.</p>
