        <p>Stroke and neurodegenerative diseases differ along several dimensions, including their temporal trajectories -abrupt onset versus slow disease progression. Despite these differences, they can give rise to very similar cognitive impairments, such as specific forms of aphasia. What has been scarcely investigated, however, is the extent to which the underlying functional neuroplastic consequences are similar or different for these diseases. Here, for the first time, we directly compare changes in the brain’s functional network connectivity, measured with resting-state fMRI, in stroke and progressive neurological disease. Specifically, we examined two groups of individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia or non-fluent primary progressive aphasia, matched for their behavioral profiles and distribution of left-hemisphere damage. Using previous proposals regarding the neural functional connectivity (FC) phenotype of stroke as a starting point, we compared the two diseases in terms of homotopic FC, intra-hemispheric FC changes and also the symmetry of the FC patterns between the two hemispheres. We found, first, that progressive disease showed significantly higher levels of homotopic connectivity than neurotypical controls and, further, that stroke showed the reverse pattern. For both groups these effects were found to be behaviorally relevant. In addition, within the directly impacted left hemisphere, FC changes for the two diseases were significantly correlated. In contrast, in the right hemisphere, the FC changes differed markedly between the two groups, with the progressive disease group exhibiting rather symmetrical FC changes across the hemispheres whereas the post-stroke group showed asymmetrical FC changes across the hemispheres. These findings constitute novel evidence that the functional connectivity consequences of stroke and neurodegenerative disease can be very different despite similar behavioral outcomes and damage foci. Specifically, stroke may lead to greater independence of hemispheric responses, while neurodegenerative disease may produce more symmetrical changes across the hemispheres and more synchronized activity between the two hemispheres.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="p0030">Stroke and neurodegenerative disease differ in terms of several key neurological features and yet they can have remarkably similar cognitive/behavioral consequences (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Ingram et al., 2020</xref>). This observation raises a number of questions about the neural consequences of the two diseases, including: Do stroke and neurodegenerative disease produce similar functional neuroplastic changes? Given the open-ended nature of this question and that fact that there have been no previous studies comparing these diseases, in this study, we use, as a starting point, the work of Siegel et al (<xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2016</xref>) who, . on the basis of a large-scale investigation of inter and intra-hemispheric functional connectivity patterns in sub-acute stroke, proposed a “general physiological network phenotype of stroke”.<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref> The proposed phenotype consisted of two key features: (a) decreased inter-hemispheric functional connectivity between homotopic regions and (b) increased intra-hemispheric functional connectivity between normally segregated functional networks in the ipsi-lesional hemisphere. In the work we report on here, we evaluate the hypothesis that stroke and neurodegenerative disease differ with regard to these network phenotypic features. This hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that, despite often producing similar cognitive/behavioral patterns, the different underlying neurological features of the two diseases, including their different temporal disease trajectories (abrupt onset versus gradual progression), may produce significantly different disease-specific neuroplastic changes. To examine the hypothesis of differential functional response patterns in stroke and neurodegenerative disease, we specifically evaluated functional connectivity in two groups of individuals with aphasia subsequent to stroke (post-stroke aphasia, PSA) and progressive neurological disease (non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia, PPA) who shared similar behavioral/cognitive profiles and distributions of left hemisphere damage.</p>

        <title>Consequences of stroke and neurodegenerative disease for functional connectivity</title>
        <p id="p0035">The <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al. (2016)</xref> stroke phenotype proposal was based on the analysis of resting-state fMRI data collected from a cohort of 100 individuals with sub-acute stroke and heterogenous behavioral deficits (including a subset of 33 individuals with aphasia). They examined interhemispheric homotopic functional connectivity (FC) as well as ipsi- and contra-lesional within and between network FC. In a previous study of FC in chronic post-stroke aphasia (PSA), <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Tao and Rapp (2020)</xref> found strong support for the claim of reduced inter-hemisphere homotopic FC, based on task-based background connectivity measures. The claim of reduced inter-hemispheric FC in PSA also found support in findings reported in <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Klingbeil et al. (2019)</xref>. Furthermore, it is generally consistent with findings from research indicating that the two hemispheres may respond very differently in PSA (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Anglade et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Gainotti, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Hartwigsen and Saur, 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Saur et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">Thulborn et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Turkeltaub, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">Turkeltaub et al., 2011</xref>). However, with regard to the second proposed phenotype feature of increased intra-hemispheric FC, <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Tao and Rapp (2020)</xref> reported that that the patterns of intra-hemispheric FC in PSA that they observed were variable between and across functional networks and, therefore, that intra-hemispheric FC patterns defied a simple phenotypic characterization (see also <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Klingbeil et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
        <p id="p0040">With regard to primary progressive aphasia (PPA), the issues of FC lateralization and hemispheric symmetry or synchronization have not been previously directly examined. However, for non-fluent PPA, there are reports of FC changes in the right hemisphere that mirror those seen in the left hemisphere, despite the right hemisphere being relatively intact structurally (<xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Mandelli et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2020</xref>), indirectly suggesting increased inter-hemispheric FC symmetry in PPA. If verified under direct examination, this pattern would be contrary to the results that have been reported for stroke. With regard to intra-hemispheric FC in PPA, both decreased and elevated FC have been found and there are both variant-specific and variant independent effects (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Agosta et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Bonakdarpour et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Lehmann et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Mandelli et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell et al., 2015</xref>). However, direct comparisons of intra-hemispheric FC in PSA and PPA using the same analysis approaches would be required in order to understand if and how these complex patterns are similar across these diseases.</p>

        <title>Temporal dynamics of disease trajectory</title>
        <p id="p0045">Neurological conditions may differ along a number of dimensions with a salient one being their temporal trajectories, with some, such as stroke or hypoxia, typically having abrupt onsets while others, such neurodegenerative diseases and slow-growing tumors, having a gradual progression. Although understanding the brain’s neuroplastic responses to these temporal differences is of great interest, their effects have been scarcely investigated.</p>
        <p id="p0050">Previous research has provided clear evidence of the relevance of the temporal characteristics of lesion for overall recovery of function. Studies comparing behavioral recovery in rats subjected to successive resections varying in the number of stages and inter-lesion intervals have consistently shown that more gradual lesions were associated with better functional recovery (<xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Patrissi and Stein, 1975</xref>, <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">Stein et al., 1977</xref>). A review (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Desmurget et al., 2007</xref>) of human studies of progressive damage (slow growing tumors) and acute damage (stroke) confirmed that gradually progressing damage generally yielded better cognitive outcomes and produced more neurotopographically distributed re-organization. These authors suggested that, with regard to the latter, progressive neurological diseases may parallel the effects of aging.</p>
        <p id="p0055">This investigation provides an opportunity to compare the consequences of diseases that vary starkly in terms of their temporal trajectories, and hence will shed light on the relevance of disease kinetics to functional neuroplasticity as well as on the possible relationship between FC patterns in neurodegenerative disease and aging. However, because the two diseases also differ along other dimensions that cannot be controlled, it will not be possible to definitely determine that the differences in temporal diseases trajectories are the source of FC differences that are documented. We return to these issues in the General Discussion.</p>

        <title>The current study</title>
        <p id="p0060">Empirical and computational work has shown that, when subjected to damage, the human connectome undergoes a complex and dynamic series of neuroplastic changes. (<xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Sale et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Saur et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">Stam et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2021</xref>, <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">Tao and Rapp, 2019</xref>). While understanding the differential effects of different neurological diseases is clearly of great importance, inferences have been severely limited by enormous inter-study variability in neural measures and analytic approaches. To address this issue, we directly compared individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA, non-fluent variant) and post-stroke aphasia (PSA) who exhibited highly similar language phenotypes (see <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Ingram et al., 2020</xref>) and distributions of left-hemisphere damage. We specifically evaluated functional connectivity as indexed by the correlation of intrinsic brain activity (measured in task-free, resting-state fMRI) between pairs of brain regions. Using the <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al. (2016)</xref> stroke phenotype proposal as a starting point, we examined functional connectivity (FC) changes in these two groups (compared to healthy controls) in terms of the two proposed stroke phenotype features. On that basis, in Analysis 1, we examined inter-hemispheric homotopic FC while, in Analysis 2a, we examined intra-hemisphere FC. In Analysis 2b, we carried out a more extensive evaluation of intra-hemispheric FC changes, directly comparing the FC changes of the two neuropathological groups with four different FC measures that evaluate functional integration/segregation at both global and local scales. Finally, in Analysis 3, we examined the degree of similarity in the patterns of intra-hemispheric FC changes between the two hemispheres, i.e., hemispheric symmetry, experienced by the two groups. The results of the full set of analyses provide novel evidence of both similar and different patterns of functional neuroplastic changes in the two groups, expanding our understanding of the possible phenotypic features of stroke and neurodegenerative disease.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p id="p0065">Participants include 55 individuals with stroke or neurodegenerative disease and 41 healthy older controls. The neuropathological group included 25 individuals with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) who had suffered a single left-hemisphere stroke at least six months prior to the investigation. The PSA data used for this study were collected at the pre-treatment timepoint of a larger study of post-stroke language rehabilitation clinical trial (NCT01927302). Data of 30 individuals with non-fluent primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) were also collected at the pre-treatment timepoint from recruited for a clinical trial (NCT02606422). These participants were diagnosed with non-fluent PPA based on neuropsychological and language testing, structural MRI, and clinical assessment, according to consensus criteria (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011</xref>) and had a history of progressive language deficits without primary memory deficits or other etiology (e.g., stroke, tumors, etc.). The two neuropathological groups were comparable in terms of years of education, gender, and aphasia profiles (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Participants in the PPA group tended to be older than those in the PSA group and, therefore, to verify that the results obtained were not due to age differences between the groups, we repeated all analyses between age-matched groups that excluded the 7 younger stroke participants and 13 younger controls (≤55 yo). Results obtained with these age-matched subgroups were comparable to those obtained with the full groups and are reported in <xref rid="s0195" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material</xref>s 6. The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board.

        <title>MRI image acquisition</title>
        <p id="p0070">All MRI data were collected using a Phillips 3T scanner at the F.M. Kirby Research Center for Functional Brain Imaging (Baltimore, MD). Similar standard parameters for the resting-state fMRI and T1-weighted structural imaging were used across the groups. For the PPA group, the scanning protocol included one session of resting-state (8.75 min) and multiple structural scanning protocols, including T1-weighted structural imaging. The acquisition parameters for the rs-fMRI were as follows: TR: 2500 ms, TE: 30 ms, FOV: 240*141*240 mm (ap, fh, rl), flip angle 75 degrees, voxel dimension: 3*3*3 mm, data matrix: 80*80*47. The T1-weighted structural MRI acquisition parameters were as follows: TR: 8.1 ms, TE: 3.7 ms, FOV: 224*160*180 mm (ap, fh, rl), flip angle: 8 degrees, voxel dimension: 1*1*1 mm, data matrix: 224*224*160. For the PSA group, the protocol included two 7-minute runs of rs-fMRI carried out consecutively, with the following acquisition parameters: TR: 2400 ms, TE: 20 ms, FOV: 206*123*220 mm (ap, fh, rl), flip angle: 90 degrees, voxel dimension: 1.7*1.7*3 mm, data matrix: 128*128*41. The T1-weighted structural MRI acquisition parameters were as follows: TR: 6 ms, TE: 2.9 ms, FOV: 256*256*176 mm (ap, fh, rl), flip angle: 9 degrees, voxel dimension: 1*1*1 mm, data matrix: 256*256*176.</p>
        <p id="p0075">Twenty of the age-matched control participants were scanned with the PPA group’s protocol and 21 with the PSA group’s protocol and the two subgroups were combined to maximize sample size. However, we also repeated the analyses including the scanning protocol as a covariate and, despite this reduction in power, obtained comparable outcomes (see <xref rid="s0195" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material</xref>s 7).</p>

        <title>Quantifying structural damage</title>
        <p id="p0080">For each PPA and PSA participant, a summary statistic of the total amount of structural damage was calculated to examine whether functional connectivity abnormalities identified in subsequent analyses were related to total structural damage. For each PPA participant, the total structural damage was indexed by the inverse of global gray matter volume calculated as the total gray matter volume divided by intracranial size using tissue segmentation results of FSL. For each PSA participant, as an index of structural damage we used the stroke lesion volume which was calculated as size of the lesion mask co-registered to standard MNI space. The lesion of each PSA participant was manually traced on their T1 images with T2-weighted FLAIR images used to improve tracing accuracy. These lesion masks were then co-registered into standard space using the transformation parameters calculated from the T1 images.</p>
        <p id="p0085">We also examined the spatial distribution of gray matter atrophy of the PPA group using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis carried out with FSLVBM (<xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Douaud et al., 2007</xref>) following the standard workflow. Specifically, the PPA group was compared to the 20 controls who were scanned with the same MPRAGE protocol as the PPA group (see <italic>Participants</italic>). Comparisons were conducted using a permutation-based voxel-wise GLM in FSLVBM with isotropic Gaussian kernel (sigma = 3 mm) spatial smoothing, including age and year of education as covariates. Voxel-wise results were corrected for multiple comparisons with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE).</p>
        <p id="p0090">In addition, to consider possible effects of gray matter atrophy in the PSA group, we also evaluated gray matter volume in PSA using the same methods as were used with the PPA group described above, but excluding lesioned areas. Details of the VBM analysis are described in <xref rid="s0195" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material 2. And</xref>a global atrophy value was calculated for each PSA participant as the inverse of total gray matter volume divided by intracranial size using tissue segmentation results of FSL, with lesion volume excluded from both.</p>

In FSL, functional images were first registered to a subject’s T1 image using boundary-based registration, then to standard MNI space. For the PSA participants, the stroke lesions were masked out during co-registration. A number of independent components were estimated by MELODIC in FSL to be used as confound variables when calculating FC (see the next section). Each participant’s in-scanner motion was quantified by the root-mean-square (rms) value calculated by MCFLIRT and used as a confound variable in group comparisons.</p>

            <title>Estimating functional connectivity (FC)</title>
            <p id="p0100">For all analyses, functional connectivity (FC) was calculated using the preprocessed time-series co-registered to MNI space. The following confound variables were regressed out from the time-series: 12 motion parameters, averaged time-series of the white matter and the CSF segmented by FAST in FSL, and the first three MELODIC independent components that were identified as motion-related by AROMA (<xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Pruim et al., 2015</xref>) together with visual inspection (see <xref rid="s0195" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material 1</xref> for summary of the MELODIC and AROMA results). FC values were then estimated with Pearson’s correlation (with Fisher’s z-transform). The functional connectomes across multiple runs for a participant were averaged. The analyses were conducted using the Python package <italic>Nilearn</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nilearn.github.io" id="ir005">https://nilearn.github.io</ext-link>).</p>
            <p id="p0105"><underline>Inter-hemispheric, homotopic FC (Analysis 1).</underline> For evaluating homotopic functional connectivity, we used the AICHA atlas (<italic>Atlas of Intrinsic Homotopic Areas,</italic>
<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Joliot et al., 2015</xref>) that was specifically developed to study homotopic FC and included 174 pairs of homotopic cortical parcels. For each PSA participant, voxels within the stroke lesion mask were excluded prior to calculating FC. Additionally, for each PSA participant, parcels with &gt;75 % overlap with their lesion mask were excluded from subsequent statistical analyses. Across the 174 homotopic connections no individual connections were excluded from the statistical analyses, but for any given connection the number of excluded participants ranged from 0 to 12 (mean = 1.8+/-2.7), with the Rolandic Opercular Gyrus being the most lesioned. This resulting in only modest variability in degrees of freedom across connections.</p>
            <p id="p0110"><underline>Intra-hemisphere FC (Analysis 2).</underline> For these analyses, we constructed whole-brain connectomes using the Power atlas (<xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2011</xref>) that consisted of 235 cortical 5 mm-radius nodes (subcortical and cerebellar nodes were excluded for the current study). For each participant, nodes with &gt;50 % overlap with their lesion and/or CSF mask were excluded, resulting in 181–234 total nodes per individual in the PSA group and 224–235 for individuals in the PPA group. Note that as for the homotopic FC, all nodes were included in the group analysis with only the degrees of freedom varying slightly across the nodes.</p>
            <p id="p0115"><underline>Connectomes for evaluating the hemispheric symmetry of FC changes (Analysis 3).</underline> The analysis goal was to evaluate the degree to which the patterns of within-hemispheric FC changes, identified in Analysis 2, were similar (symmetrical) in the two hemispheres. However, since the Power atlas did not have a 1–1- correspondence of nodes in the two hemispheres, for each node in each hemisphere (from the Analysis 2 connectome), we generated a node at its mirror location in the opposite hemisphere, resulting in a connectome with a total of 235 pairs of symmetrical nodes. No nodes were excluded from the group analysis but after considering lesioned/atrophic tissue, there were a total of 357–469 nodes per individual in the PSA group and 445–470 for those in the PPA group.</p>

        <p id="p0120">Lower than normal homotopic FC has been shown to be a salient FC feature in stroke (<xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Tao and Rapp, 2020</xref>). Here we examined homotopic FC in the post-stroke aphasia (PSA) and PPA groups to investigate if PPA exhibited the same characteristics as PSA. First, we compared the average homotopic FC strength across all 174 cortical pairs of homotopic regions from the AICHA atlas between each neuropathological group and the control group. Second, for each neuropathological group, we characterized the spatial distribution of the homotopic FC changes across the brain by comparing the FC strength of each homotopic connection with those of healthy controls. Third, to examine the behavioral relevance of the homotopic FC changes, we evaluated their relationship with behavioral measures of language and executive functioning. For the latter analysis, we calculated an average homotopic FC change value for each participant in each group by averaging the FC change values for the abnormal homotopic connections identified from the previous step. As an overall indicator of language performance we used the language sub-score of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Knopman et al., 2008</xref>) for the PPA group and the WABAQ (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Kertesz, 2006</xref>) for the PSA group. To index executive functioning, we used the Trail Making Test (A + B, <italic>Army Individual Test</italic>
<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Battery, 1944</xref>) for the PPA group and the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (<xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Raven, 1941</xref>) for the PSA group, a test that heavily relies on working memory and cognitive control (<xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Prabhakaran et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Rao and Baddeley, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Sánchez-Cubillo et al., 2009</xref>).

        <p id="p0125">The between-group comparisons were carried out with linear regression with Group as an independent variable and amount of in-scanner motion as the covariate. The connection-wise results were corrected for the 174 homotopic connections using the FDR correction (<italic>alpha &lt; 0.05</italic>). For the evaluation of the relationship between homotopic FC changes and behavior, regression analyses were carried out in which each participant’s average FC strength was predicted by the behavioral scores of language and executive function tasks described above, with amount of structural damage and in-scanner motion included as covariates. The regression analyses were carried out with the <italic>lm</italic> function in R.</p>

To examine this, we first conducted an analysis of all individual connections to obtain a panoramic view of the intra-hemisphere FC changes; we refer to this as a “connection-based” analysis. To do so, for each intra-hemispheric connection we compared FC strength for the PSA and PPA groups with the control group using independent t-tests. For the Power atlas, there are 6327 connections within the left-hemisphere, and 7625 within the right hemisphere. The results were FDR corrected for the total 13,952 connections (alpha &lt; 0.05).</p>

          <p id="p0135">For a more in-depth comparison of the FC changes between the two neuropathological groups, we focused on nodal properties (i.e., FC properties of each brain region/node). We used nodal values, rather than connection-based values, because a nodal scale of data compression represents an intermediate level of granularity that preserves information for each brain region while also providing reasonable interpretability. For example, a nodal-based analysis allows one to see quite easily which regions are driving the dis/similarity between the two groups. Specifically, we examined four different nodal measures, two based on mean FC strength and two graph-theoretic measures, thus providing two measures of FC properties at both global and local scales.</p>

        <p id="p0140">First, for each node, we calculated its <underline>mean-FC</underline> strength as the average FC of its connections with other nodes. Moreover, as the resting-state functional connectome is known to consist of multiple functional networks, we separated each node’s connections into <italic>within-</italic> and <italic>between-network</italic> connections based on a reference network organization identified with 38 older participants (&gt;50 yo, mean age = 65+/-10) from a publicly available dataset NKI-Rockland (<xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Nooner et al., 2012</xref>, see <xref rid="s0195" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material 3</xref> for details). As depicted in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a, the reference organization consisted of 6 networks that we refer to, based on their neuroanatomical distribution, as: Occipital, Dorsal Frontoparietal (dFP), Perisylvian, Frontoparietal (FP), Temporal, and Default Mode Network (DMN). With the reference network, we calculated one global and one local <underline>mean-FC</underline> measure for each node: the <italic>global, between-network</italic> mean-FC value of a node corresponded to the mean FC of the connections between the node and every other node outside its own network (global FC); The <italic>local, within-network</italic> mean-FC value corresponded to the mean FC of a node’s connections with all other nodes within its own network (local FC) (see <xref rid="s0195" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref> for a schematic illustration of the FC measures). Note that we calculated mean-FC strength values by averaging both positive and negative FC values. We did so because there is no clear consensus in the literature on the best approach for dealing with negative FC values and averaging is a very common approach. Additionally, this approach was consistent with the empirical observation that, in this data set, the negative FC values were overall lower in magnitude than the positive ones (for details, see SFig. 14).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The reference functional network organization and the analysis flow.

Those nodal FC <italic>t</italic>-maps served as the bases for Analyses 2b and 3.

For each of the four measures described above, the nodal values of each neuropathological group were compared to the control group using linear regression with Group as an independent variable and amount of in-scanner motion as the covariate, generating a whole-brain, nodal <italic>t</italic>-map for each neuropathological group that represented differences between that group and the control group. We will refer to the differences in FC between each neuropathological group and the control group as <bold>FC changes</bold> and to the nodal <italic>t</italic>-maps that represent them as <bold>FC-change maps.</bold> We then examined how similar the two groups’ overall FC changes were by correlating (Pearson’s r) their FC-change maps within each hemisphere separately (See <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b for illustration of this analysis). These correlations were calculated for each of the four FC measures and their statistical significance was evaluated with 10 K permutation testing. Results were further Bonferroni corrected for the 8 comparisons (4 measures*2 hemispheres).</p>

        <title>Analysis 3: Comparison of the hemispheric symmetry of FC changes for the PPA and PSA groups</title>
        <p id="p0160">Lastly, we examined the degree of similarity between the two hemispheres’ FC changes for both the PPA and PSA groups. For each PPA and PSA participant, we calculated a <italic>LH-RH change symmetry</italic> score for each of the four FC measures as follows: For each node, we first computed its z-score against the control group value, then we correlated (Pearson’s r) the z-scores between the 235 homologues nodes in the left and the right hemisphere to obtain a participant-specific <italic>LH-RH change symmetry</italic> score for each of the four FC measures (See <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b for illustration of this analysis). Scores for the PPA and PSA groups were compared with linear regression with Group as an independent variable and in-scanner motion included as a covariate. Results were Bonferroni corrected for the four FC measures.</p>
        <p id="p0165">Because the hemispheric <italic>symmetry change score</italic> values were based on the FC change values (i.e., z-scores), they indexed the symmetry of the FC changes relative to the neurotypical controls. In addition, therefore, we also examined the raw FC symmetry using the original nodal FC values for each participant and compared the values of each neuropathological group to the control group.</p>

        <p id="p0180">The examination of the FC strength of 173 cortical homotopic pairs based on the AICHA atlas revealed that, on average, the PSA group’s homotopic connectivity values were significantly lower than controls (<italic>t = -4.42, p = 2.71e-5</italic>) consistent with the “stroke phenotype” reported in previous studies (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Klingbeil et al., 2019</xref>; Joshua Sarfaty <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Tao and Rapp, 2020</xref>).

<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a). In other words, for the PSA group, activity across homotopic regions were less synchronized than in neurotypical controls and for the PPA group, the reverse pattern was observed. Furthermore, the distributions of abnormal homotopic FC connections were also very distinct for the two groups with a more widespread and more anterior distribution in PPA and a more posterior and lateral distribution in PSA (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b).<fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Inter-hemispheric homotopic functional connectivity changes for the two neuropathological groups (Analysis 1).

        <p id="p0185">To determine if these homotopic FC patterns had any behavioral relevance, we examined their relationship with behavioral measures. Because the two neuropathological groups were recruited for different studies, they shared few behavioral tests. We thought it could nonetheless be useful to consider two broad cognitive areas that were assessed in both groups (albeit with different specific tests): executive functioning and language. For the PPA group, who had overall higher-than-normal (elevated) homotopic FC values, for the significantly abnormal connections (shown in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b), higher average homotopic FC values were found to be correlated with lower executive performance (longer Trail reaction times, p = 0.0065), but uncorrelated with language proficiency (CDR-language p = 0.72, <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c). Similar to the findings based on the CDR-language scores, scores from other language tasks (i.e., repetition, naming) were not correlated with the abnormal homotopic FC (see <xref rid="s0195" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material 8</xref>). In contrast, for the PSA group, who had overall lower-than-normal homotopic FC values, for the significantly abnormal connections, higher average FC values were correlated with better language performance (WABAQ p = 0.0077) but were uncorrelated with executive functioning scores (Raven: p = 0.52, <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). The other language tasks (i.e., repetition, naming) showed similar effects as the WABAQ (<xref rid="s0195" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material 8</xref>). Additionally, the total amount of structural damage was uncorrelated with abnormal homotopic FC for either group (PPA atrophy: p = 0.27; PSA lesion volume: p = 0.27, atrophy of RH: p = 0.27). Detailed statistics of these analyses are reported in <xref rid="s0195" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material 4</xref>.</p>
        <p id="p0190">In sum, although homotopic FC patterned in opposite directions for the two groups (abnormally high in PPA and abnormally low in PSA), for both groups better behavioral performance was associated with closer-to-normal levels of homotopic FC. Furthermore, the abnormal homotopic FC values showed behavioral relevance that was consistent with their anatomical distribution—medial frontal homotopic abnormalities in PPA were associated with executive processing performance and lateral temporal/parietal homotopic abnormalities in PSA were associated with language performance. The fact that these strikingly different FC patterns were associated with different cognitive functions in the two groups despite their overall similarity in terms of left hemisphere damage distribution and language profiles will be discussed in the General Discussion.</p>

        <title>Analysis 2a. Intra-hemispheric functional connectivity changes in PPA and PSA</title>
        <p id="p0195">This analysis examined connection-based changes of intra-hemispheric FC for each neuropathological group. As depicted in <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, for both PPA and PSA, we observed both increased and decreased FC relative to the controls. For PPA, while there were many more connections with decreased compared to increased FC across the brain (286 vs 46), the numbers of decreased/increased connections were similar for the two hemispheres (decreased: 152 LH, 134 RH; increased: 46 LH, 61RH). The PSA group exhibited a more similar total number of increased and decreased connection (70 vs 51) but there was a striking hemispheric difference such that decreased FC connections were heavily concentrated in the left-hemisphere and increased FC connections were largely in the right-hemisphere (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. decreased: 63 LH, 7 RH; increased: 19 LH, 32RH). Overall, these results do not provide clear support for the proposed “stroke phenotype” feature of increased ipsi-lesional FC, since for the PSA group the FC increases were concentrated in the RH and for the PPA group they are distributed similarly across both hemispheres. Furthermore, both groups also exhibited large numbers of connections with reduced FC values .<fig id="f0020"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Intra-hemisphere, connection-wise functional connectivity (FC) changes of the PPA (top) and the PSA group (bottom).

        <p id="p0200">We also examined whether the abnormal intra-hemispheric FC values (separately analyzing the elevated and reduced values for each group) were related to the amount of structural damage in each hemisphere respectively. We found that, for PPA, the abnormal FC values were not related to amount of atrophy in either hemisphere (see Table S3). For PSA, we observed that reduced FC in the RH was related to greater RH atrophy (r = −0.45), and no significant correlations were found with lesion volume (see Table S3).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="p0235">To better understand the consequences of stroke and progressive brain disease for the brain’s functional reorganization and neuroplastic responses, we examined the functional network organization of two groups of individuals, one with primary progressive aphasia (PPA, non-fluent variant) and another with post-stroke aphasia (PSA). More specifically, we set out to evaluate the hypothesis that the two diseases may differ with regard to two stroke phenotype features proposed in <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al (2016)</xref>: decreased inter-hemispheric and increased intra-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC). In order to be in a position to draw stronger inferences about the contribution of disease type to any observed FC changes, we selected groups that were well matched in terms of locus of neuroanatomical damage (left frontal and anterior parietal lobe, <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and aphasia profiles (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Using resting-state fMRI, we examined four FC properties, two each at global and local network scales. Our key findings were as follows: (1) With regard to inter-hemispheric homotopic FC (hemispheric synchronization), the PSA group exhibited lower than normal levels, consistent with the Seigel et al. phenotype feature, whereas the PPA group exhibited higher than normal FC between homotopic areas. These changes were found to be associated with different behavioral patterns (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). (2) With regard to intra-hemispheric FC, in the primarily damaged left hemisphere, both groups showed complex patterns of FC increases and decreases (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) which, nonetheless, were highly correlated across the two groups for all the four FC measures (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast, in the relatively intact right hemisphere, the two groups showed distinct FC change patterns with the PPA group exhibiting FC changes that mirrored those in the left-hemisphere, whereas PSA exhibited a markedly different pattern of FC changes in the right hemisphere compared to the left (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>); (3) Importantly, across all four FC measures, the PPA group showed significantly more symmetrical changes across the two hemispheres compared to the PSA group (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Together, the results reveal similar FC properties in the heavily damaged left hemisphere for both stroke and progressive aphasia. Otherwise, despite similar language profiles and damage distributions, the two groups exhibited distinctive patterns of inter-hemispheric FC symmetry and synchronization,</p>

        <title>Functional connectivity between the hemispheres (hemispheric synchronization)</title>
        <p id="p0240">Homotopic FC measures the degree to which the fMRI time-courses of homologous brain regions of the two hemispheres are correlated and, thus, can be seen as reflecting the degree of synchronization (or integration) between homologous brain regions of the two hemispheres. <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al. (2016)</xref> proposed that a decrease in homotopic FC was a key phenotypic feature of stroke. In the current study, our finding of significantly lower than normal homotopic FC for the PSA group (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) provides further support for the claim. The current findings are also consistent with those we reported in <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Tao &amp; Rapp (2020)</xref>. While the previous study and the current one involved a largely overlapping set of PSA individuals, the neural measures were entirely different. <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Tao &amp; Rapp (2020)</xref> analyzed background connectivity extracted from task-based BOLD obtained while participants were carrying out a spelling task in the scanner while, in the present study, resting-state BOLD was analyzed. The finding of similar results with different neural measures and different stroke groups at both sub-acute and chronic stages strengthens the claim that decreased homotopic FC may well be a characteristic feature of stroke.</p>
        <p id="p0245">Importantly, the analyses revealed opposite patterns in PSA and PPA, with the PPA group exhibiting a significant increase in homotopic FC relative to controls that was also significantly higher than that observed in the PSA group (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, the two neurological diseases resulted in highly distinctive FC changes with regard to the synchronization of resting-state activity across homologues areas. This is consistent with our prediction that the two diseases would differ regarding fundamental FC features, despite the overall similarity of the groups in terms of language profiles and damage distribution.</p>
        <p id="p0250">The behavioral relevance of these homotopic FC changes was supported by their significant association with behavioral measures. For the PSA group, which showed lower than normal homotopic FC, lower FC values were associated with lower language scores (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>d). For the PPA group, which exhibited higher than normal homotopic FC, higher FC values were associated with worse executive performance (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c). In sum, for both groups, more abnormal homotopic FC values (either elevated or reduced) were related to worse behavioral scores. Of further interest is the fact that the two groups showed complementary patterns: for the PSA group the homotopic FC changes were unrelated to executive function scores, while for the PPA group they were unrelated to language scores.<xref rid="fn2" ref-type="fn">2</xref> This complementary pattern of association between homotopic FC changes and behavior is likely related to the different neurotopographical distributions of the significant homotopic FC changes, namely, the PPA group exhibited a largely medial and anterior distribution of elevated homotopic FC, while the PSA group’s reduced homotopic levels were concentrated in lateral temporal and posterior areas (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b). In other words, behavioral performance was linked to FC changes in brain areas associated with the correlated cognitive functions such that executive function performance was associated with homotopic FC changes in the medial/anterior regions that are often associated with executive functions, while language performance was linked to homotopic FC changes involving (temporal and parietal) language-related areas.<xref rid="fn3" ref-type="fn">3</xref> Note that despite contrasting overall patterns of elevated and depressed homotopic FC in the two groups, a few connections were identified with reduced homotopic FC in the PPA group when scanning protocol was included as a co-variate (supplementary analyses, SFig. 10), and a small number of connections were identified with elevated homotopic FC in the PSA group (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b, also SFig. 6, 10). Thus, there may exist a small number of homotopic connections with values that are different from the overall patterns. It is likely that specific cohort characteristics (e.g., lesion size and location, disease progression) play a role in whether these values emerge as statistically significant in any given sample. It will be useful for future research to examine the homotopic FC patterns in each group in more detail as any variability may constitute a source of information regarding underlying neurophysiological mechanisms.</p>

        <title>Similar patterns of left-hemisphere FC changes</title>
        <p id="p0255">The second stroke phenotype feature proposed by <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al (2016)</xref> was increased FC between ipsi-lesional functional networks. In that regard it is worth noting that <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Tao &amp; Rapp (2020)</xref> already reported a complex pattern of ipsi-lesional left hemisphere FC changes in the stroke group they studied and pointed out that even <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al (2016)</xref> had not reported a consistent FC pattern in the ipsi-lesional hemisphere. In fact, the significant result Siegel et al. reported was limited to the FC between the dorsal attention network and the default mode network. Thus, this second proposed stroke phenotype feature had already not received strong support, somethingwe confirmed in the current study.</p>
        <p id="p0260">We found a complex picture that included both FC increases and decreases in the left hemisphere (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Both groups actually exhibited an overall decrease in left hemisphere FC, although there were also a small number of statistically significant FC increases as well. What was most salient, however, was the similarity of the left-hemisphere FC change patterns for the two groups (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In fact, for the four nodal FC measures, at both local and global scales, there were strong and highly significant correlations between nodal FC values across the two groups (r values ranged from 0.4 − 0.7) in the heavily damaged left-hemisphere. This similarity of the left-hemisphere FC profiles across the groups seems to suggest (at least for these FC measures) that the different characteristics of the two diseases (e.g., the nature of the structural damage and the disease trajectories) may not have been highly relevant in the left hemisphere and that, instead, the <bold>location</bold> of damage (regardless of its etiology) was the primary driver of the neuroplastic FC changes we observed. Note that we also found that the overall magnitude of structural damage (global gray matter atrophy and lesion volume for PPA and PSA, respectively) was not a significant predictor of the left-hemisphere FC changes (<xref rid="s0195" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material 4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Different patterns of right-hemisphere FC changes</title>
        <p id="p0265">The original stroke phenotype study (<xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2016</xref>) did not report significant FC effects in the contralesional hemisphere in their analysis of post-stroke FC changes. However, it is worth noting that their sample was extremely heterogenous and included individuals with either left or right hemisphere stroke at the subacute stage (&lt;2 weeks). In contrast, the current investigation that involved only chronic (&gt;6 months) left hemisphere stroke and a more behaviorally homogeneous population. Here we found that both PPA and PSA groups exhibited significant FC changes in the right hemisphere (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). For the PSA group these consisted almost entirely of FC increases relative to controls, while for the PPA group the right hemisphere changes consisted primarily of FC decreases. Furthermore, even the FC increases were distributed quite differently for the two groups, as they were concentrated in ventral regions in PPA and primarily in dorsal areas in PSA. Thus, in contrast to the strong similarity of the FC changes for the two groups in the left hemisphere, the two groups exhibited quite different patterns of FC changes in the right hemisphere (see <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The contrast between the two hemispheres in terms of between-group similarity is captured quantitatively by the finding that for three of the four FC measures (all except CC) the correlations of FC changes between the two groups were significantly lower in the right hemisphere than in the left (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
        <p id="p0270">A key question concerns the cause of these right hemisphere differences between the two groups. One possibility to consider is that the FC changes in the RH are driven by different degrees of structural damage in the RH. However, we did not find that the FC changes in the RH were related to the extent of structural damage except for the finding that for the PSA group, reduced RH FC was moderately related to greater RH atrophy (r = -0.45, uncorrected p = 0.03, see Table S3), and the same trend was also evident in the PPA group (r = -0.3, uncorrected p = 0.11, see Table S3). Thus, the divergent RH FC patterns of the two groups are not readily explained by differences between the groups with regard to structural damage. This suggests an alternative account, raising the possibility that the divergence between the two groups in terms of FC patterns could have been driven by differences in the time-course of the two diseases that may have resulted in different patterns of functional reorganization. This is a hypothesis that would especially benefit from longitudinal empirical studies as well as computer simulation work.</p>

        <title>Differences in the inter-hemispheric symmetry of FC changes</title>
        <p id="p0275">The differences between the PSA and PPA groups with regard to the functional synchronization of the homotopic regions described above (i.e., homotopic FC, <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), imply that the two groups also differ in the degree to which changes in one hemisphere mirrored those in the other (i.e., hemispheric symmetry). The question of hemispheric symmetry of FC changes was examined in more detail in Analysis 3 which went beyond examining connectivity between homologous areas, to a more comprehensive examination of multiple measures of FC changes within each hemisphere in order to examine the degree to which changes in one hemisphere were reflected in the other. This detailed analysis of hemispheric FC symmetry revealed that across all four FC measures, the FC changes exhibited by the PPA group were significantly more similar across the hemispheres than they were for the PSA group (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In other words, the PPA group experienced more symmetrical FC changes than did the PPA group. Moreover, we found no statistically significant correlations between the degree of FC symmetry and the extent of structural damage (Analysis 3). The finding of robust differences in the hemispheric symmetry of FC changes between the two groups may well represent the most significant contribution of this work to our understanding of the characteristic (or phenotypic) FC responses of the brain to these different neurological diseases.</p>

        <title>Differences in hemispheric symmetry and synchronization: Underlying mechanisms?</title>
        <p id="p0280">Stroke and progressive neurological disease differ along various dimensions making it extremely difficult to determine which dimension/s is/are responsible for both the similarities and differences in the neuroplastic responses we have reported for the two groups. Despite this difficulty, the issue is of fundamental importance and, therefore, merits some discussion. Here we bring together the relevant evidence (albeit limited) from this investigation regarding the nature of the structural damage, the location of the structural damage and the temporal trajectories of the diseases.</p>
        <p id="p0285"><underline>Nature of the structural damage.</underline> Compared to progressive neurological disease, stroke clearly produces a more severe focal structural disruption to the brain, directly destroying contiguous regions of gray matter and often creating white matter disconnections. Particularly in the chronic stage it can additionally produce diffuse gray and white matter atrophy (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Brodtmann et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Crofts et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Egorova-Brumley et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, in progressive neurological disease, although damage is typically concentrated in a disease “epicenter” (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Rogalski et al., 2011</xref>), damage is more diffuse than in stroke even within highly affected regions as these areas are typically not fully destroyed but continue to contain neurons and their connections. While we are not in a position to draw strong conclusions about the contribution of these differences in the nature of the structural damage to the FC differences we have reported, we believe that it is worthwhile to review some of the potentially relevant evidence from this study.</p>
        <p id="p0290">First, in various analyses we evaluated the contribution of the magnitude of damage to the FC patterns we have observed. For PPA, the magnitude of structural damage was quantified as gray matter atrophy, and for PSA it was quantified as the stroke infarct (and we also considered atrophy volume for PSA). The rationale for these analyses was that if the nature of the damage was a key factor in accounting for the observed FC changes, more damage would likely be associated with greater FC changes. However, contrary to this prediction, across these analyses we found little evidence of significant relationships between FC changes and the magnitude of structural damage (see Supplementary Material 4).</p>
        <p id="p0295">Second, we speculated that if the nature of the structural damage were critical in determining FC patterns, then the two groups would differ in their FC patterns more in the left hemisphere where the structural damage was concentrated. However, we found instead that the FC patterns for the two groups were more highly correlated in the heavily damaged left hemisphere and differed more in the right hemisphere (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
        <p id="p0300">In sum, while these observations by no means fully address the possibility that differences in the focal/diffuse nature of the structural damage is the mechanism underlying the group differences in FC changes that we have reported, it is nonetheless the case that they do not especially support this hypothesis.</p>
        <p id="p0305"><underline>Temporal disease dynamics.</underline> Although increased homotopic FC synchronization and inter-hemispheric FC symmetry have not been specifically previously evaluated in PPA, in healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease a loss of hemispheric specificity and greater “homogenization” of activation patterns have been proposed to be signature functional changes (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Goh, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Meinzer et al., 2009</xref>). Relatedly, symmetrical functional changes have been reported in PPA (<xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Mandelli et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Ranasinghe et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
        <p id="p0310">With regard to lifespan changes in lateralization of function, from childhood to adulthood brain areas supporting higher cognitive functions have been shown to become increasingly lateralized (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Olulade et al., 2020</xref>), presumably reflecting functional specialization and neural differentiation. However, starting in later middle age this trend may reverse with more distributed and bilateral activation patterns (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Cabeza, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Meinzer et al., 2009</xref>) and increasing levels of inter-hemispheric synchronicity (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Avelar-Pereira et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2010</xref>). The reasons for this “re-emergence” of greater hemispheric symmetry in aging is debated. Some have proposed a general process of de-differentiation (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Cabeza, 2002</xref>), while others, including some working on preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease, have suggested that some of these neural changes may be compensatory and precede overt behavioral decrements (for reviews see <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Hillary and Grafman, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Stargardt et al., 2015</xref>). The fact that de-differentiation across the hemispheres has been observed both in progressive brain disease and healthy aging suggests that they might be a response to a gradual time-course of damage. In the context of progressive neurological disease, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Desmurget et al. (2007)</xref> specifically speculated that these characteristics may be due to plasticity mediated by a gradual “supervised learning process” that allows for the reshaping of proximal and distal functional networks. With regard to behaviora consequence, they suggestthat, after a long pre-clinical period of changes that help maintain behavioral integrity, the gradual damage exceeds neuroplastic capacity and behavioral deficits emerge. Despite these intriguing similarities, the extent to which progressive neurological disease and aging share similar neoplastic changes and underlying disease kinetics is a topic that clearly merits further careful attention.</p>
        <p id="p0315">In terms of stroke, the increased FC asymmetry between the hemispheres that we found is consistent with other previous reports indicating that in post-stroke aphasia, the ipsi-lesional LH often shows hypo-connectivity while the RH often shows hyper-connectivity that may normalize or persist throughout the chronic period (<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Hartwigsen and Saur, 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Saur et al., 2006</xref>). These findings support the conclusion that after stroke, the contra-lesional hemisphere undergoes functional changes that are distinct from those that occur in the ipsi-lesional hemisphere. Interestingly, similar findings have also been reported in the context of tumor resection (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Almairac et al., 2021</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Coget et al., 2018</xref>). While tumor resection may typically occur following a more prolonged period of neural disruption than stroke, both stroke and resection include major, abrupt neurological changes. Thus, similarities in FC outcomes between the stroke and tumor resection support the hypothesis that abrupt, unilateral focal damage may trigger functional dissociations between the two hemispheres.</p>
        <p id="p0320"><underline>The location of structural damage.</underline> The two previous sections focused on possible explanations for the observed <italic>differences</italic> in the FC changes across the two groups. However, also potentially relevant to understanding underlying mechanisms are the similarities in FC changes that we observed. The fact that these changes were so similar in the heavily damaged left hemisphere (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) suggests that neither the nature of the structural damage nor the different temporal disease trajectories can provide a full explanation. Instead, the patterns of similar FC changes across the groups seem likely to be the result of the location of the structural damage rather than factors related to damage etiology. In other words, the similar spatial damage distributions of the two groups produced similar FC changes. Because specific brain regions participate in specific functional and structural networks, their damage may trigger functional reorganization patterns that are independent of the nature of the damage. Examining other PSA and PPA groups with different damage epicenters (e.g., semantic and logopenic variant PPA) will be important for determining the extent to which the specific FC features we have observed in this study are linked to specific damage location or to the disease etiologies more generally.</p>
        <p id="p0325">In sum, while the available evidence regarding underlying mechanisms of the FC differences we have documented in stroke and neurodegenerative disease is very limited, it does suggest that the distinct functional changes of the two groups observed in the right-hemisphere and in inter-hemispheric relationships were not driven by the nature of the structural damage (diffuse vs focal). Instead, we have argued that disease time-course remains a viable hypothesis. However, as the spatial and temporal features are overlapping for the current two groups (i.e., abrupt disease onset and focal damage vs slow development and diffuse damage), it is extremely difficult to disentangle the two factors. Importantly the results do suggest that the location of damage is a relevant factor for understanding the FC similarities observed in the heavily damaged left hemisphere. Understanding the possible contributions and interactions between these factors clearly will require further examination including, importantly, longitudinal studies of FC changes in diseases with different damage time-courses, damage types and damage locations.</p>

      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p id="p0330">Limitations include that, within PPA, we examined only the non-fluent PPA variant. Examination of other PPA variants will be necessary to determine if the features we observed for PPA generalize across the disease or are restricted to the non-fluent variant. More generally, the study of additional diseases and conditions (e.g., anoxia, slow-growing tumors, vascular brain disease) will allow further disentangling of the contribution of damage type and disease trajectory. Finally, a more comprehensive and detailed examination of FC-behavior relationships would be very valuable, although it was clearly beyond the scope of this paper that was focused on documenting and describing robust FC changes. Despite the limited investigation of FC-behavior relationships, the fact that different patterns of homotopic FC changes in the two groups were associated with different cognitive functions (executive functions in PPA and language in PSA), does underscore the behavioral relevance of FC changes and provides some initial insights regarding the nature of the reorganization that results from the different neuropathologies.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p id="p0335">In this study we identified shared and distinct features of the functional neuroplastic responses of two neuropathological conditions -- stroke and neurodegenerative disease. We specifically examined two groups of individuals with post-stroke and progressive aphasia with regard to the two stroke phenotype features proposed by <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al. (2016)</xref> -- decreased inter-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) and increased intra-hemispheric FC. We found that the two diseases differed from one another clearly and substantially regarding inter-hemispheric, homotopic FC. However, with regard to the second stroke phenotype feature we found that neither group provided a exhibited a consistent pattern of increased intra-hemispheric FC. We did find, however, that the two groups were strikingly similar in terms of their patterns of left hemisphere FC but differed in their FC patterns in the right hemisphere. Overall, we found that generally similar distributions of left hemisphere damage in the two etiologies resulted in similar functional connectivity changes within the left hemisphere. However, abrupt onset, focal disease produced greater independence in hemispheric responses, while a slowly developing diffuse damage resulted in more symmetrical changes across the hemispheres as well as more synchronized activity between them. These findings constitute novel evidence regarding the specific patterns of functional reorganization associated with stroke and neurodegenerative disease. They not only underscore the importance of disease location in shaping neuroplastic responses, they raise the possibility that the temporal time-course of damage progression may also play a significant role in the brain’s response to damage.</p>

        <p id="np040">Functional connectivity analyses serve to evaluate the strength of functional relationships between brain areas, with connectivity operationalized as the degree of correlation of neural activity between brain areas. Functional connectivity analyses, compared to approaches that evaluate mean activation or other functional characteristics of specific brain areas, provide a means for evaluating the degree to which different brain areas are integrated or segregated and how these relationships are affected by neurological disease.</p>

        <p id="np045">While we acknowledge that it would have been preferable for both groups to have been tested on the same language and executive function tasks, that was not possible given that the data were collected from different studies. Nonetheless, we would note that as researchers we typically draw inferences across studies that do not use the same tasks. In other words, we assume that inferences about language and executive functions can be valid across a range of tasks measuring these skills.</p>

        <p id="np050">We note that while it is true that some values for the PSA group were excluded from analysis (parcels of a participant if&gt;75% of the parcel is damaged), and hence some parcels have a lower degree of freedom for the PSA group, it is very unlikely that this complementary pattern between PSA and PPA was due to greater exclusion of participants from the analysis anterior nodes due to the primarily anterior lesions of the PSA group, for the following reasons: 1) No parcels were completely excluded from the analysis, instead individual participant values were excluded for the PSA group. The participant level exclusion could introduce lower statistical power (decreased sample size) in the results which would be unlikely to increase the probability of significant effects; 2) the PSA group’s most lesioned areas (i.e., MCA territory) and the regions that had elevated levels of FC in the PPA group do not overlap. In other words, the regions shat showed elevated FC in the PPA group did not have decreased statistical power due to missing data-points in the PSA group. Thus, this is an unlikely explanation for the group differences we observed.</p>
