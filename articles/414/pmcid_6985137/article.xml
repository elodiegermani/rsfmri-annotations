        <p id="Par1">Patient stratification is critical for the sensitivity of clinical trials at early stages of neurodegenerative disorders. In Huntington’s disease (HD), genetic tests make cognitive, motor and brain imaging measurements possible before symptom manifestation (pre-HD). We evaluated pre-HD stratification models based on single visit resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data that assess observed longitudinal motor and cognitive change rates from the multisite Track-On HD cohort (74 pre-HD, 79 control participants). We computed longitudinal performance change on 10 tasks (including visits from the preceding TRACK-HD study when available), as well as functional connectivity density (FCD) maps in single rs-fMRI visits, which showed high test-retest reliability. We assigned pre-HD subjects to subgroups of fast, intermediate, and slow change along single tasks or combinations of them, correcting for expectations based on aging; and trained FCD-based classifiers to distinguish fast- from slow-progressing individuals. For robustness, models were validated across imaging sites. Stratification models distinguished fast- from slow-changing participants and provided continuous assessments of decline applicable to the whole pre-HD population, relying on previously-neglected white matter functional signals. These results suggest novel correlates of early deterioration and a robust stratification strategy where a single MRI measurement provides an estimate of multiple ongoing longitudinal changes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par2">The detection of treatment effects in clinical trials is partly limited by the individual differences in the population under study. In neurodegenerative disorders, enrichment strategies to decrease sample heterogeneity and identify subjects likely to respond to treatment are important for the efficiency and success of clinical trials, especially for early interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Given the high dimensionality of neurological data, computational approaches including machine learning techniques appear particularly promising for detecting individual differences in clinical populations by integrating distributed information, providing stratification of subjects for predictive or enrolment purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par3">Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurological disorder caused by an expansion in the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat region in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The earliest symptoms are related to changes in mood and cognitive ability, followed by lack of motor coordination, unsteady gait, and chorea, ultimately leading to dementia and death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. If we take into consideration that clinical damage associated with the disease is potentially irreversible, early intervention is imperative. For this to happen, trials with patients at early stages should be tailored towards individuals who will develop a steep deterioration, since testing experimental early treatments on stable individuals can produce misleading results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par4">The availability of genetic tests has enabled large neuroimaging studies, such as PREDICT-HD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and TRACK-HD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, which have followed patients and controls over several years, even before motor-based diagnosis. These cohorts provide opportunities for moving beyond descriptive statistical observations toward assessments that provide predictions at an individual level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. (Note that in the context of predictive modelling, “prediction” refers to the ability to make assessments on previously-unencountered individuals, not necessarily forecasts of future events). Cross-validated strategies are a step toward that goal, where different sets of subjects are used for training a model and for testing its individual predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In that sense, it is critical that the signals distinguishing individuals are reliable across successive measurements that are repeated on time scales that are short with respect to the expected rate of change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, but also that learned patterns are shown to be robust, e.g. valid across sub-cohorts from different imaging sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par5">In neuroimaging, structural correlates of HD such as striatal atrophy have received most attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a more recent development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and, since then, most analyses have been restricted to specific subnetworks or considered few regions, or seeds. However, functional brain networks are scale-free<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, i.e. their degree distributions follow power laws spanning several orders of magnitude. This phenomenology can only be observed on networks with a large number of nodes such as voxel-level resolution networks. In addition, functional signals and networks of neurobiological significance have been recognized recently in white matter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, previously-overlooked correlates of disease progression may be found by analyses designed to reflect these major aspects of functional networks.</p>
      <p id="Par6">Track-On HD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> is an extension of the TRACK-HD study that included yearly rs-fMRI data for up to 3 years in more than 200 pre-manifest HD (pre-HD, i.e. before diagnosis based on motor symptoms) subjects and healthy controls. Images are accompanied by a wealth of cognitive and motor measures, most also acquired during preceding TRACK-HD visits, in combination spanning up to 7 yearly measurements. Such a rich dataset allows for the estimation of subtle longitudinal changes in cognition and motor control, allowing subjects to be compared to their own performance baselines, and enabling analyses of population heterogeneity for a stage at which systematic brain differences from controls are mild<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, because performance on different tasks might rely on the same affected neural systems, it is possible to identify combinations of measures for which longitudinal changes covary, potentially boosting behavioural signal-to-noise and isolating common brain structures responsible for cognitive decline.</p>
      <p id="Par7">Here, we evaluate the potential of single rs-fMRI scans for stratification of pre-HD individuals with respect to cognitive/motor decline, which has never been tested. We built functional connectivity density (FCD) maps (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) from a Track-On HD cohort of 153 subjects (74 pre-HD, 79 healthy controls) at the voxel-level. We first established test-retest reliability of multivariate FCD measures. We then trained cross-validated predictive models (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) to segregate pre-HD subpopulations according to cognitive/motor longitudinal trajectories (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) along multiple dimensions. To establish robustness of predictive power, we used a leave-one-site-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) approach. The resulting models suggest a stratification strategy that considers disease progression in terms of longitudinal rates of change along different cognitive dimensions, and where a single MRI scan provides such information, otherwise measurable over years.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Brain measures, models, and cohort. (<bold>a</bold>) Functional connectivity density (FCD) maps. A voxel-wise correlation matrix is computed from BOLD time courses and functional links are defined as above-threshold correlations. A voxel’s degree, defined as the number of its associated links, is a simple measure of centrality. We refer to the logarithm of degree (plus one) as FCD. (<bold>b</bold>) Multivariate cross-validated models. Subjects were assigned a label defined by a measure of cognitive/motor decline after correcting for healthy age/sex expectations (fast vs slow decline, excluding intermediate subjects during training), or by genetics (pre-HD vs control). Subjects from three of the four imaging sites (all but one) were included in the model training set. Performance of the model was estimated on subjects from the remaining site, and the process was iterated for every site (leave-one-site-out cross-validation, LOSO-CV). Test-site validation was quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Additionally, for cognitive stratification, the Spearman rank correlation of the continuous output of classifiers vs cognitive decline rates was estimated using all subjects from test sites. (<bold>c</bold>) Patient cohort. Participants belonged to the Track-On HD study. Two rs-fMRI samples were used per subject. Longitudinal change in performance on 10 cognitive and motor tests was evaluated, including measurements from the immediately preceding TRACK-HD study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2020_58074_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e358"/></fig></p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p id="Par8">We included 153 participants from the four Track-On HD study sites in this analysis, belonging to one of two groups: 74 individuals without manifest HD (before diagnosis by a physician based on motor symptoms) but carrying the mutant HTT gene and 79 roughly age- and sex-matched controls (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for demographics).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Cohort demographics.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Controls</th><th>Pre-HD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>N</td><td>79</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Sex (Female)</td><td>30</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Age (mean ± STD)</td><td>49 ± 11</td><td>42 ± 10</td></tr><tr><td>CAG</td><td>—</td><td>43 ± 2</td></tr><tr><td>CAP</td><td>—</td><td>48 ± 8</td></tr><tr><td>Expected years to disease onset</td><td>—</td><td>11 ± 4 (minimum: 5)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>CAG: number of CAG repeats in the HTT gene.

Here we use the formula CAP = 100 × AGE × [(CAG − 35.5) ÷ 627], i.e. normalized so that score at disease onset (diagnosis based on motor symptoms) is approximately 100.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
        <p id="Par9">Exclusion criteria for analysis were as follows: manifest disease at any point before MRI acquisitions, age below 18 or above 65 (unless previously part of the TRACK-HD study), history of major psychiatric, neurological, or medical disorders, or severe head injury. These criteria are part of the Track-On HD study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, we excluded left-handed individuals, as known rs-fMRI lateralization differences in motor regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> are outside the focus of this analysis, as well as those with fewer than two visits with rs-fMRI scans. Furthermore, we excluded subjects based on scan motion or unsatisfactory registration to standard template (see below, and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for detailed numbers).</p>
        <p id="Par10">The Track-On HD study was approved by local ethics committees (Leiden site: Medical Ethical Commission of Leids Universtais Medisch Centrum; Vancouver site: Clinical Research Ethics Board at the University of British Columbia; London site: National Research Ethics Service of the National Health Service (NHS) London; Paris site: Comité de Protection des Personnes Ile De France VI, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital) and all participants gave written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Cognitive/motor measures</title>
        <p id="Par11">On each visit, participants (both controls and pre-HD patients) were administered several motor and cognitive tests. For consistency with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, the following tests were considered: Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), self-paced tapping, grip-force variability, map search, Stroop test, spot change test, cancelation test, mental rotation, indirect circle tracing, and counting backwards. Detailed description of tasks and their outcome measurements is provided elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (see Supplementary Information for a brief summary). Tests were administered on each yearly visit in most cases (up to 3 in Track-On HD). Several tests were also included in the immediately preceding visits from the previous TRACK-HD study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, in which case up to seven time points were available (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, distribution of visits for each task in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par12">To quantify longitudinal cognitive change for asymptomatic HD patients, we computed the slope of longitudinal performance change for each task. The underlying change is not necessarily linear; however, slopes are used as the simplest measure of subtle decline given the few time points per subject and measurement noise. All sessions in which a given subject was administered a test were included in the slope estimation, including those preceding fMRI acquisitions.</p>
        <p id="Par13">For consistency, we defined the sign of all task measures such that a negative longitudinal slope would indicate decline.</p>
        <p id="Par14">As we were interested in cognitive decline beyond the effects of healthy aging sex or age, we removed variance associated with these covariates. Linear effects of sex and age were estimated and removed using data from healthy controls.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>Robust principal components for cognitive/motor measurements</title>
        <p id="Par15">Different tasks involve overlapping skills and brain circuits. Therefore, their longitudinal slopes share with each other a portion of inter-subject variability (i.e., they covary). To find measures of degeneration along different <italic>effective</italic> dimensions (that is, reflecting decoupled aspects deterioration), we computed decorrelated combinations of slopes via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), based on their covariance matrix. To reduce sensitivity to the presence of outliers, we used Minimum Covariance Determinant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, a robust method to estimate the covariance matrix. Units of the slopes of different tasks are different, so we also normalized slopes of each task by its interquartile range to produce a dimensionless quantity that could be combined with the other tasks.</p>
        <p id="Par16">We performed the PCA procedure twice: 1) First, both pre-HD subjects and controls were included, and the slopes were corrected (see below) for effects of normal aging and sex estimated from healthy subjects (using the age at the time of acquisition of the first functional image). This allowed a visualization of pre-HD and control trajectories, to confirm longitudinal differences were observable. 2) A second PCA included only slopes from pre-HD subjects, to best capture heterogeneity within this population. These are the principal components (PCs) we used for stratifying the pre-HD population (see “Discretization of cognitive/motor trajectories” below, and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> for a flowchart).</p>

        <title>MRI data Acquisition</title>
        <p id="Par17">3T MRI data from 2 different scanner systems (Siemens Tim Trio and Philips Achieva) distributed across four acquisition sites were acquired, as described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, including multiple design measures before and during acquisition to maximize data homogeneity across sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par18">In brief, T1-weighted image volumes were acquired using a 3D MPRAGE acquisition sequence with the following imaging parameters: TR = 2200 ms (Siemens)/7.7 ms (Philips), TE = 2.2 ms (S)/3.5 ms(P), FA = 10° (S)/8° (P), FOV = 28 cm (S)/24 cm (P), matrix size 256 × 256(S)/224 × 224(P), 208(S)/164(P) sagittal slices to cover the entire brain with a slice thickness of 1 mm (no gap 1 mm isotropic voxels).</p>
        <p id="Par19">For rs-fMRI, whole brain volumes were acquired with a TR of 3 s using a T2*-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: TE 30 ms, FOV 212 mm, flip angle 80°, 48 slices in ascending order (thickness: 2.8 mm, gap: 0.5 mm, in plane resolution: 3.3 × 3.3 mm) and bandwidth of 1906 Hz per Px. 165 time points were acquired for 8:20 minutes. All data passed visual inspections centralized by IXICO.</p>

The first 5 time points of the fMRI time series were discarded to exclude unsteady acquisitions. Slice-timing correction was applied followed by rigid realignment to the volume in the middle of the series (motion-correction).

Elastic net regularization is a penalty term that automatically performs variable selection, reducing overfitting. Unlike other variable selection terms such as LASSO, elastic net can select more features than the number of training samples (critical when the number of features is much larger than available samples), and is more stable when correlated features are present. Logistic regression was chosen over other linear classifiers due to good optimization convergence when combined with elastic net penalty using a SAGA optimizer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> on similar datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, but model performance is similar to a standard support vector machine.

This metric has the advantage that it is a measure of a continuous output, independent of the choice of a decision threshold, and robust to imbalanced classes. We computed the AUC for each test site and averaged them. For robustness of the estimation to outliers, we repeated the computation with bootstrap resampling (random resampling with replacement, 10<sup>5</sup> resamples) of the test subjects, and reported the median value. In the case of stratification models, it should be noted that the AUC tests whether a pattern of ongoing decline is successfully learned, but not its application to the general pre-HD population.

We defined three subgroups for each single task or PC projection: fast, intermediate, and slow, which corresponded respectively to subjects below, in-between, or above half a robust estimate of the standard deviation of decline away from the median. The robust estimate of the standard deviation was defined as the standard deviation of a normal distribution with the same interquartile range as the observed distribution of decline, making it insensitive to outliers. This threshold was chosen because, while being the same for all tasks, it divided the pre-HD population approximately into terciles. We performed cross-validated classifications between the extreme subgroups (fast and slow) on the basis of FCD maps (stratification models). Subjects with a slope or PC projection in-between these extreme ranges were not included in the classification of the two subgroups. This was the case for roughly one third of the subjects, the exact number depending on the PC or task (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).

The ‘optimized’ VBM protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> of the FMRIB Software Library (FSL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> was used to evaluate grey matter patterns, as detailed in a previous study on the TRACK-HD cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. For each subject a T1-weighted image was used along with masks estimated from concurrent T2-weighted volumes to do brain extraction of the raw T1-weighted volume. The resulting images were then segmented into 3 tissue partial volumes (grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations) that represent the probability of each voxel belonging to a given tissue. Grey matter concentration (GMC) volumes of each subject/visit were nonlinearly normalized to the MNI standard space using FSL’s FNIRT routine (without normalization by the Jacobian determinants). The resulting GMC images were down-sampled to the resolution of FCD maps using linear interpolation to preserve their range. For each voxel the linear effect of GMC on FCD across subjects was estimated (i.e., a voxelwise covariate). For each subject at each voxel, the expected FCD based on the local GMC was subtracted from the observed FCD. The residuals constituted local-atrophy-controlled FCD maps. We used this atrophy-controlled FCD maps in multivariate detection of pre-HD (vs controls), and stratification models, for comparison of the resulting predictive power, and their associated weight maps. In addition, we evaluated full-brain GMC maps in terms of their multivariate predictive power to differentiate pre-HD vs control subjects, and stratification of the population with a LOSO-CV scheme, identically as done with FCD maps.</p>

More that 67% of the baseline maps had their top correlation with the follow-up map from the same subject (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), two orders of magnitude above chance expectations (1 in 153, i.e. 0.65%, red line in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

        <p id="Par46">We then evaluated the reliability of FCD maps for reflecting a neurologically meaningful difference, that of pre-HD vs controls. Classification based on presence or absence of mutated HTT gene is ideal to study within-subject reliability: genetic labels have virtually no associated noise, and are strictly stable across visits. Moreover, because functional differences are mild in gene-carriers far from symptom onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, the sensitivity to test-retest fluctuations is expected to be higher than for strong neurological signatures. We trained binary classifiers using sex- and age-corrected FCD maps validated using LOSO-CV to ensure robustness to site differences. The resulting AUC (0.64, p = 0.00082, permutation test, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) was compatible with mild but detectable signatures of pre-HD. Subjects classified correctly with the first FCD sample were highly likely to be classified correctly also with the second sample (95% consistency for pre-HD, p &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>; 76% consistency for controls, p = 0.0007 permutation test; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), indicating high consistency for correct classifications. Moreover, the whole transition matrix was dominated by the diagonal, so consistency of errors was also well above chance levels (63% for controls, p = 0.0007; 69% for pre-HD, p &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>, compare to chance matrix in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), suggesting misclassifications were driven by reliable FCD heterogeneity and not random noise. Together, the observed consistency suggests high test-retest reliability of multivariate FCD patterns from visits separated up to 2 years, and motivates the study of individual variation within the disease, which is consistently observed but not captured by group differences.</p>

        <p id="Par52">Binary classification of subjects from the extreme subgroups based on cognitive slopes from single tasks was possible for several tasks: SDMT, cancelation task, and paced tapping. The strongest results were observed for the SDMT task (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Visual inspection of the ROC curve (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, AUC: 0.73, p = 0.0023, permutation test) shows the predictive power resided in the correct identification of cases with highest confidence (vertical and horizontal segments near the extremes). The result suggests robust information in FCD maps about ongoing cognitive decline.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>FCD stratifies pre-HD by longitudinal cognitive decline.

        <p id="Par53">That validation tested whether brain patterns of ongoing decline could be learned, but not its application to the larger pre-HD population. However, the binary classifier can provide information in a setting where a patient might not belong to either subgroup but to the intermediate range not considered during training. This is because linear classifiers provide a continuous output: the (signed) distance to the decision hyperplane (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). To validate the usefulness of this measure in the whole pre-HD population, we computed on each test site the Spearman rank correlation between the distance to the decision hyperplane and the cognitive slope using all pre-HD subjects, and taking an average across sites (see Methods, “Validation of continuous classifier output for pre-HD stratification”). The average correlation was significant for the SDMT (Spearman’s rho = 0.41, p = 0.00005, permutation test) and the cancelation tasks (Spearman’s rho = 0.27, p = 0.00464, permutation test). This is illustrated for the SDMT task in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>. We note that the out-of-sample correlations that can be achieved are limited by noise in cognitive slopes. As a reference, an optimistic estimate for the SDMT task (see Supplementary Information) indicates a ceiling for correlations at around 0.6. The results suggest the continuous output of the classification models can be informative for stratification by longitudinal decline of subjects from the whole pre-HD population.</p>
        <p id="Par54">What neurological signals underlie these predictions? We inspected the voxel-level correlations between FCD measures and SDMT slopes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), which revealed patterns of association between SDMT decline and WM functional connectivity. These included clusters around the basal ganglia (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, top row), but mostly consisted of increased FCD on bilaterally-symmetrical WM extensions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, center row), and also reduced FCD on cortical regions, notably left temporal cortex (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, bottom row). These observations reveal the spatial extent of signals related to early cognitive decline, and suggest WM as a source of functional signals associated with it in pre-HD.</p>
        <p id="Par55">The finding that stratification was possible for decline along more than one individual task could indicate the existence of multiple distinct decline signals, or simply one shared signal that underlies change along the individual tasks. We used the PCs of cognitive slopes to investigate whether stratification was possible along components of decline that were uncorrelated from each other, keeping in mind that because PCs are orthogonal by design they combine tasks with different signs, limiting interpretability. Stratification was possible, using the same LOSO-CV scheme, for three PCs (1, 4, and 5), in which models successfully distinguished extreme subgroups of decline (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The first component combined most tasks with positive signs, providing a summary of global decline. While the others are harder to interpret, we note PC 4 combined SDMT, cancelation, and self-paced tapping with the same sign, which were the tasks that showed best individual results. This suggests stratification along individual tasks might not be a consequence of a single dominant direction of decline, and instead stratification along multiple measures survives in decorrelated decline components.</p>

        <title>Robustness of FCD patterns to non-functional covariates</title>
        <p id="Par56">The goal of our analyses was not only to establish the predictive power of FCD maps but also to interpret them as reflecting functional signals. Therefore, even if predictions have been validated across imaging sites, we also verified the robustness of the identified patterns when controlling for non-functional sources of variation. In particular, we trained the main multivariate classification algorithms presented above (pre-HD vs. controls and stratification by SDMT decline) after correcting FCD features by a local atrophy measure (grey matter concentration as estimated by voxel-based morphometry, see Methods), removing variance attributable to scanning sites (even if there were no group differences on any of them, as assessed by chi-squared tests, see also Methods for details on harmonization), and skipping FCP map normalization by its median. Detection of pre-HD signatures (vs. controls) with these alternative FCD maps had similar predictive power (AUC: 0.64, p = 0.0005, permutation test), and the classifier weights showed a similar cluster in the globus pallidus (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). Performance of stratification by SDMT change was again comparable to the original model (AUC: 0.69, p = 0.007 permutation test; Spearman’s rho = 0.37, p = 0.00025, permutation test) and the voxel weights of the classifier revealed similar clusters (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>) on white matter, while grey matter (GM) clusters on the temporal lobe were no longer observed, indicating perhaps concurrent GM atrophy. We also evaluated full-brain GMC maps (including WM voxels and with the same resolution as FCD maps), in terms of multivariate detection of pre-HD change (AUC 0.52, p = 0.378), and stratification by SDMT slopes (AUC 0.53, p = 0.39; Spearman’s r: 0.09, p = 0.24), showing low predictive power. Taken together, these observations suggest that the predictive patterns found are unlikely to be a reflection of local atrophy, site, or effects of normalization choice.</p>
        <p id="Par57">We also considered effects of in-scanner motion, as quantified by the mean framewise displacement (Methods, “Removal of motion associations”). Both groups had very similar motion distributions (pre-HD vs controls, p = 0.77, Mann-Whitney U-test, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). We computed motion associations with cognitive decline rates (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>), which was significant for the SDMT (Spearman’s rho = −0.32, p = 0.006) and “spot the change” tasks (Spearman’s rho = 0.28, p = 0.02). Head motion association was not sufficient (e.g. “spot the change” task) nor necessary (e.g. cancelation task) for stratification results. We performed direct controls for FCD features in SDMT stratification (see Methods, “Removal of motion associations”). Both model performance and brain patterns were robust to this control (AUC: 0.73, p = 0.0009, permutation test; Spearman’s rho = 0.35, p = 0.00031, permutation test; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par58">Finally, we considered whether addition of CAG repeats to the FCD features improved the stratification results. Results with these combined features were almost identical (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par59">We investigated the reliability and stratification power of FCD in pre-HD using a cross-validated multivariate approach. FCD patterns showed high within-subject reliability. We found that longitudinal slopes provided a sensitive measure of early cognitive decline and FCD features could be used to stratify the population across multiple components of change. Together, these results highlight the potential of FCD as a tool with valuable applications.</p>
      <p id="Par60">Relative to structural markers, the literature of resting state measurements in HD is relatively recent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Cross-sectional correlations of resting-state fMRI with clinical measures were reported on predefined components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. With that approach, cross-sectional group differences were observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> within the TRACK-HD study but longitudinal group-differences were not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The Track-On HD extension allowed for the investigation of putative compensation mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and relationships with the anatomical connectome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. A valuable step toward predictive applications has been a recent study combining structural and resting-state markers in 19 premanifest patients used to predict transition to the manifest state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Our goal was to further push the field from descriptive brain mapping toward predictive models that directly detect the population heterogeneity unexplained by genetic disease load, before manifestation.</p>
      <p id="Par61">Key for the usefulness of fMRI as a tool is verifying its robustness across known sources of variability such as sites and individuals. Site heterogeneity has been suggested to be a major challenge for robustness of models, and of LOSO-CV has been proposed as a methodology to ensure generalizability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This was the motivation behind our choice. However, it is possible that the efforts made to minimize site discrepancies during acquisition in Track-ON<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> make site differences unrepresentative of those found in other potential practical applications. In terms of within-subject consistency, concerns have been raised regarding the reliability of fMRI for biomarkers to be applied at the individual level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. The use of multivariate models avoid the important consistency issues of single links: models that rely on global patterns have been shown to be robust enough to enable individual fingerprinting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This allowed us to extend assessments from other studies of test-retest reliability for rs-fMRI in pre-HD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> to the individual level. We found that FCD maps contained a highly reproducible signature that identified individuals. This extends robustness to a new feature type, FCD, but also in time, since the scans considered were separated by one or two years. More important neurologically, we found that the mild pre-HD signatures are highly reproducible within-subjects (0.95 consistency in pre-HD subjects), highlighting the importance of sorting out the reproducible heterogeneity.</p>
      <p id="Par62">The single clearest signature of pre-HD in FCD was bilateral hyper-connectivity centred on the globus pallidus and its interface with the putamen. This is striking because the globus pallidus is not prominent in markers of volume change compared to the putamen. Anomalous FCD of the globus pallidus in the past was perhaps previously unobserved because of the use of predefined components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> or networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> that excluded this region. It was unperturbed when correcting by GMC. In fact, the same models using full-brain GMC maps did not significantly distinguish the groups. We note that GMC could distinguish groups with 70% accuracy in the larger TRACK-HD cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> in models that included only grey matter voxels, higher resolution voxels, and a different cross-validation scheme. Even then, the globus pallidus did not contribute to that discrimination. Interestingly also, the pallidus pattern seemed to be a generic signature of pre-HD, but did not appear to be relevant for the cognitive decline stratifications within the pre-HD population.</p>
      <p id="Par63">In contrast, the recurrent finding in our stratification by cognitive decline is the hyper-connectivity of white matter (WM). Although until recently disregarded as noise, there is no evidence against the detection of physiological BOLD signals in WM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. On the contrary, several studies have found reproducible WM activations in tasks requiring interhemispheric integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, and several features that speak to their physiological origin: they depend on diffusion anisotropy and fibre orientation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, on activity of connected cortical areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and alertness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In resting state fMRI, highly reproducible WM networks have been reported and are associated with combinations of known tracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Of particular interest, WM activations were reported in SDMT specifically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, the task where we found the largest WM associations. WM signatures have started only recently to be exploited as potential markers of brain disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This is the first demonstration of functional WM signals in HD. Future studies should focus on the mechanisms of white matter functional signals in neural degeneration.</p>
      <p id="Par64">We found SDMT to be more strongly associated with FCD features than any other measure, either individual tasks or PCs. SDMT has long been recognized as one of the best measures of early deterioration in HD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. In this dataset, it is the task that showed strongest group differences in longitudinal decline. It is possible that this sensitivity of the task to tracking progression, in combination with reliance on white matter integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, explains its advantage over the other tasks considered. PCs were meant to isolate different dimensions of cognitive change in an unsupervised way. In addition, they are orthogonal by design, and as a result of this constraint can mix tasks sensitive to disease progression with those that are not. These properties of the method could explain why a high-sensitivity task could have a stratification advantage over PCs.</p>
      <p id="Par65">The interpretation of the current results should not be considered separately from the limitations of this study. First, the cohort was restricted to premanifest participants, which limited our conclusions to the premanifest period and likely introduced a selection bias, as suggested by the strong anticorrelation between age and CAG repeats. Similarly, inclusion of only right-handed subjects, common in the neuroscientific literature, can limit clinical applications. In addition, cross-validated analyses could have overoptimistic results, particularly if care is not taken to exclude the possibility of “double-dipping”, as in the choice of model hyperparameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. While we made efforts to avoid such instances using nested-cross-validation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, conclusions should be validated on a separate, independent cohort. In terms of cognitive/motor changes, available data included visits that preceded rs-fMRI acquisition for the sake of maximizing power to detect changes. Because of that, one should not interpret our models as evidence of the ability to predict future decline but rather to detect ongoing cognitive change; and prediction in this context refers to the ability to make assessments for individuals not considered during model training. Similarly, AUC-based validations were based on binary labels that did not include the full pre-HD population and should not be taken as evidence of usefulness in more general clinical contexts. Correlations with continuous decline using the full population (our second validation) should be considered as effect sizes for that scenario. Finally, the signatures found by our models are partly a consequence of the type of model chosen. Multiple model types are possible, with different complexities. However, this is an issue for every analysis effort, even univariate comparisons, which assume a type of model implicitly. We used a linear model for its simplicity of interpretation.</p>
      <p id="Par66">Early progression of HD is usually modelled in terms of the CAP score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> and predictive models have used this, sometimes combined with cognitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> and brain measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, for the prediction of the age of diagnosis or conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Part of the value of our approach lies in its acceptance that degeneration trajectories are heterogeneous, placing individuals in a multidimensional space. Accordingly, we focused on the prediction of longitudinal change as opposed to estimating proximity to a given behavioural threshold, as schematized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Such multidimensional estimates could not only inform patient selection in clinical trials, but potentially be used for individualized quantification of treatment effect sizes and expected patient evolution from ongoing decline, increasing sensitivity.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Hypothetical application of FCD information about cognitive/motor change to individuals. A single fMRI measurement would be obtained on an individual. The corresponding FCD map would be projected onto pre-trained classifier weights which would help position the patient by expected decline along single cognitive/motor measures or combinations of them (similar to Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Patients in which ongoing change is expected could receive treatment and their evolution could be compared against an expected individualized trajectory, increasing sensitivity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2020_58074_Fig5_HTML" id="d29e1532"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par67">In conclusion, we found robust evidence for the usefulness of FCD as a stratification tool. This is critical because subjects showing signs of decline are unlikely to slow their course in the absence intervention. In this context, FCD provides a new window into the evaluation, in a single visit, of ongoing change, an important type of assessment for which few alternatives exist.</p>
