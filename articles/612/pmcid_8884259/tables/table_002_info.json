MNI coordinates are reported for each brain region that served as the seed voxel. Within each cluster, the increase in average correlation (z-score) with the responder seed compared to the nonresponder seed is estimated by \u03b2; a negative b denotes the cluster is more strongly correlated to the nonresponder seed.", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_002.csv"}
