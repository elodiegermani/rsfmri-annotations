        <p>Patients of acute ischemic stroke possess considerable chance of recovery of various levels in the first several weeks after stroke onset. Prognosis of functional recovery is important for decision-making in poststroke patient care and placement. Poststroke functional recovery has conventionally been based on demographic and clinical variables such as age, gender, and severity of stroke impairment. On the other hand, the concept of connectome has become a basis of interpreting the functional impairment and recovery of stroke patients. In this research, the connectome-based predictive modeling was used to provide predictive models for prognosing poststroke functional recovery. Predictive models were developed to use the brain connectivity at stroke onset to predict functional assessment scores at one or three months later, or to use the brain connectivity one-month poststroke to predict functional assessment scores at three months after stroke onset. The brain connectivity was computed from the resting-state fMRI signals. The functional assessment scores used in this research included modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI). This research found significant models that used the brain connectivity at onset to predict the mRS one-month poststroke and to predict the BI three-month poststroke for patients with supratentorial infarction, as well as predictive models that used the brain connectivity one-month poststroke to predict the mRS three-month poststroke for patients with supratentorial infarction in the right hemisphere. The connectome-based predictive modeling could provide clinical value in prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="p0025">Brain function is thought to be effected by the functional brain networks. Stroke impairs the physiology of the functional brain networks and leads to dysfunction of motor control, sensation, language, thinking, memory, etc. Poststroke treatment such as rehabilitation can help the patient to relearn the skills impaired due to the stroke. Through focused repetitive practice of a lost skill, the functional brain networks may undergo a circuit rewiring, so called neuroplasticity, to undertake the lost function. The effectiveness of functional recovery is assessed with various rating scores. For example, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Rankin, 1957</xref>) measures the degree of disability or the degree of dependence in daily activities. An mRS evaluation will result in one among the 7 scores ranging from score 0 for no symptoms at all to score 6 for being dead. Scores 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 denote no significant, slight, moderate, moderately severe, and severe disability, respectively (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Broderick et al., 2017</xref>). For another example, Barthel Index (BI) is used to assess a patient’s progress toward independence by evaluating the physical assistance required by the patient to perform activities (<xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Mahoney, 1965</xref>).</p>
      <p id="p0030">Timing is a crucial factor for a successful recovery. An earlier treatment will generally result in a better recovery of the impaired skills. A prognosis in the acute stage helps to direct the decision of poststroke medical treatment or rehabilitation on the basis of individual recovery potential (<xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Koch, 2021</xref>). However, prediction of stroke outcomes remains a clinical challenge despite numerous prediction tools have been developed (<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Stinear et al., 2019</xref>). For example, a multivariate linear regression model was developed for predicting BI score based on the patient age, sex, binarized Glasgow Coma Scale score, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and stroke subtype (<xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Douiri, 2017</xref>).</p>
      <p id="p0035">The connectome has recently been used to develop prediction models for researches of attention (<xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Yoo, 2018</xref>), cocaine abstinence (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Yip, 2019</xref>), anxiety (<xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Wang, 2021</xref>), propensity (<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Lu, 2019</xref>), loneliness (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Feng, 2019</xref>), etc. A connectome-based predictive model (CPM) (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Shen, et al., 2017</xref>) is built by selecting from the whole-brain data a set of interregional functional connections most relevant to the predicted target and using these selected as the predictors. There have been different definitions of function connectivity based on various data modalities (<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Eickhoff, 2015</xref>). In this research, the functional connectivity of two brain regions refers to the temporal correlation of their blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals assessed with resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI).</p>
      <p id="p0040">Depending on the number of brain regions of interest, there may be tens of thousands or even more functional connections in a whole brain. Among such a huge amount of functional connects, usually only a few are associated with the target parameter to be predicted (feature selection). To build a connectome-based predictive model of stroke outcome, a large amount of data must be provided to train the model. In the training process, a set of the most relevant functional connects will be identified to form a predictor of the CPM. The selection of functional connects and the model building of CPM is conceptually similar to the training process of machine learning of artificial neural network.</p>
      <p id="p0045">This research was aimed at devising a procedure of connectome-based predictive model for prognosis after acute ischemic stroke. Specifically, it would be interesting to investigate whether a predictive model can be derived solely based on the inter-regional connectivity.</p>

        <title>Subject recruiting</title>
        <p id="p0050">Acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to Landseed International Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan in 10 days of onset were recruited in the study. The study period was between Jan. 2015 and Dec. 2018. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Each patient recruited and his/her legal representatives were informed with the motivation and the aim of this research and the right of the recruited before a consent was signed by the legal representatives. The recruited patients received routine poststroke medical care including rehabilitation. As depicted in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the levels of disability and dependence were assessed with mRS and BI along with MRI acquisition at three stages—the day of stroke onset, one month after onset, and three months after onset. The collected MR images included T1-weighted (T1w) images to be used for defining anatomical regions of interest (ROI), diffusion-weighted images (DWI) for clinical inspect of infarct locations, and rs-fMRI for derivation of functional connectivity. The protocol of this research has been reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the hospital.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The three stages of MRI acquisition and functional assessment, followed by patient grouping for conducting connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>

        <title>Preprocessing of rs-fMRI</title>
        <p id="p0075">Preprocessing of rs-fMRI is to remove or at least reduce undesirable artifacts, noise, timing deviation, or spatial distortions, as well as to transform the original data to a standard format. It is essential before subjecting raw rs-fMRI data to further processing and analysis. To fulfill the functions of preprocessing, several software packages can be utilized, such as Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/" id="ir005">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>), Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://restfmri.net/forum/rest" id="ir010">https://restfmri.net/forum/rest</ext-link>) (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Song, 2011</xref>), and Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rfmri.org/DPARSF" id="ir015">https://rfmri.org/DPARSF</ext-link>). The preprocessing comprises multiple steps: (1) discarding the first 10 rs-fMRI scans to retrospectively accommodate the time for magnetization equilibrium and the subjects’ adaptation to the environment; (2) slice-timing correction to realign all slices in time to correct the time disparity in the multi-slice acquisition; (3) six-parameter rigid-body transformation to compensate for the head motion during acquisition, by which&lt;1-mm translation and&lt;1° angular rotation were attained in the resultant images; (4) co-registering the T1w image to the average rs-fMRI; (5) gray matter segmentation on T1w to help construct the deformation matrix for spatial normalization of the T1w image to a Montreal Neurological Institute space; (6) utilizing the deformation matrix to conduct spatial normalization of T1w and rs-fMRI followed by a resampling with a voxel size of 3 × 3 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>; (7) spatial smoothing using a Gaussian spatial filter with a 4-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM); (8) filtering with a 0.01–0.08 Hz passband to eliminate high-frequency noise as well as to detrend; (9) removal of spurious signals irrelevant to neural activities by regressing the nuisance covariates, including the six head-motion parameters, global mean signal, white matter signal, and cerebrospinal fluid signal.</p>

An element <italic>r<sub>ij</sub></italic> in the correlation coefficient matrix is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the functional assessment score and the connectivity between node <italic>i</italic> and node <italic>j</italic> over all the subjects. An element <italic>p</italic><sub>ij</sub> of the <italic>p</italic>-value matrix is the result of a significance test on the correlation coefficient <italic>r<sub>ij</sub></italic>.</p>

The elements of the pos-edge matrix or the neg-edge matrix corresponding to the edges with <italic>p<sub>ij</sub></italic> &gt; <italic>α</italic> are all assigned the value 0.

By conducting CPM separately on the 4 patient groups, 2 assessments (i.e., mRS and BI), 3 predictions (i.e., 1 → 2, 1 → 3, and 2 → 3), and 2 edge polarities (i.e., pos-edge and neg-edge), totally 4 × 2 × 3 × 2 = 48 predictive models were generated, as will be shown in <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. However, not all the predictive models thus generated can be used. Analysis of the statistical significance of the correlation between the real values and the predicted values of a functional assessment score was done to validate the predictive models. <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the results of the leave-one-out cross validation. Predictive models that lead to statistically significant correlation, i.e., with a relatively high correlation coefficient and a <italic>p</italic>-value lower than 0.05, would be considered significant.</p>

        <p id="p0115">By using the BrainNet Viewer program (State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China), the functional connectomes of the human brain can be represented with a ball-and-stick graph, where a ball represents a brain region and a stick represents the connectivity between two brain regions (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, a ball-and-stick brain net contained the edges that are considered relatively more relevant to the predictive models. In the cross-validation process for a certain predictive model, different edge patterns in pos-edge and neg-edge matrices were generated. We selected just a few edges that appeared relatively more times than most other edges in these different edge patterns. These selected edges constituted the ball-and-stick brain net shown in this paper.</p>

        <title>Function connectivity vs motor function</title>
        <p id="p0145">The ability to predict the possible course or outcome of brain functions is critical in the prognosis of poststroke care. Golestani et al. (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Golestani, 2013</xref>) found that patients with impaired motor functions had lower functional connectivity derived from resting-state fMRI, and the connectivity was reestablished if the patients recovered several days afterwards. Carter et al. (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Carter et al., 2012</xref>) observed contribution of decreased interhemispheric connectivity to neuromotor impairment after stroke. Puig et al. (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Puig, 2018</xref>) found that incorporating functional connectivity in their prediction of 90-day modified Rankin Scale would considerably increase the accuracy than only using the 3-day National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score. Min et al. (<xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Min, 2020</xref>) found that the patients with better functional outcomes have greater functional connectivity. Using functional connectivity based on resting-state fMRI is advantageous in that it requires less patient cooperation and avoids the influence by the difference in types of impairment or patients’ task performance. In addition, resting-state fMRI facilitates the study of multiple networks (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Golestani, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Carter et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

        <title>CPM</title>
        <p id="p0150">Previously, CPM has been used to predict or interpret brain functions or disorders. For example, it has been used to predict sustained attention ability (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Fountain-Zaragoza, 2019</xref>) and even changes of attention in minutes, days, weeks, or months (<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg, 2020</xref>). Yip et al. demonstrated the prediction of cocaine abstinence in the study of treatment outcomes of cocaine use disorders (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Yip, 2019</xref>). Other than the above-mentioned, this research applies CPM for predictive modeling for poststroke functional recovery, inspired by some related research findings. For example, researchers have found association of functional recovery with preserved functional connectivity (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Almeida, 2017</xref>) and decreased or increased connectivity in the contralesional hemisphere of stroke brains (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">De Bruyn, et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
        <p id="p0155">Brain functions are supported by widely distributed networks across brain regions. Hence, even if a stroke only causes local structural damage, dysfunction in remote regions may occur through network connections (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Carter et al., 2012</xref>). For example, a lesion in the area containing corticospinal tract not only can cause direct dysfunction but also can indirectly impair upstream function by changing the network connectivity (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Carter, 2012</xref>). The CPM method constructs predictive models considering all the connections in the whole brain to incorporate the effects from all parts of the brain. It is more advantageous than a prediction method based on clinical variables, which only reflect limited partial effects of the intricate brain connections.</p>
        <p id="p0160"><xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows that there were significant differences between the behavior scores at Stages 1, 2, and 3. As can be seen from <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, the evolution of the scores was divergent among the patients. In other words, the recovery of different patients progressed differently. Hence, to predict a behavior score at a later stage with a behavior score at a previous stage would be inaccurate. In contrast, with the significant connectome-based predictive models among the candidates in <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the brain connectivity instead of a behavior score was used to predict a behavior score at a later stage. This could result in more accurate prediction because the CPM method in this research picked predictive models consisting of the brain edges most relevant to the change of the behavior score.</p>
        <p id="p0165">As depicted in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, not only the models based on pos-edges but also those based on neg-edges could be selected as significant predictive models. Considering that the connectivity of a neg-edge negatively correlated with the functional assessment scores, it might seem unreasonable to use a neg-edge–based predictive model to predict a functional assessment score. In fact, this can be explained by the compensational mechanism of poststroke brain behaviors. After stroke onset, the connectivity of some other edges would be strengthened to compensate the edges that were impaired by the stroke attack. As the impaired edges gradually recover, the compensating edges will also recover (i.e., revert to their original connectivity) and this leads to negative correlations between the connectivity of the compensating edges and the functional assessment score. This hypothetical theory justifies the neg-edge–based predictive models; however, further researches may be needed to verify it.</p>
        <p id="p0170">As can be seen in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, the progress of the rehabilitation scores from Stage 1 to Stage 2 was quite different from that from Stage 2 to Stage 3. This could imply that the 1 → 2 predictability was different from the 2 → 3 predictability. Thus, for each patient group, significant models for 1 → 2 prediction and for 2 → 3 prediction didn’t necessarily concur.</p>
        <p id="p0175">The CPM method seems to possess different predictive ability for mRS and BI. This study found two significant predictive models for mRS, whereas only one for BI. Both mRS and BI are the most widely used functional outcome measures of neurological deficits. MRS is used to assess the overall disability or dependence of the patient’s daily activities. BI is used to assess the patient’s independence from physical or verbal help in feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, toilet use, transfers, walking, and stair climbing, and degrees of bowel and bladder control. BI is prevalently used for longitudinal follow-up poststroke, whereas there is a timing effect on the sensitivity in differentiating functional recovery with the mRS (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Cioncoloni, 2012</xref>). Due to mRS–BI discrepancies in the target behavior functions and the timing effects, that a significant model for mRS can be found does not ensure that a significant model for BI can also be found, and vice versa.</p>
        <p id="p0180">A predictive model constructed with the CPM method takes the inter-regional connectivity computed from the rs-fMRI signals to predict the functional recovery. The modeling and predicting is readily automated and can be harmoniously integrated into the modern intelligent clinical procedure.</p>

        <title>Brain nets</title>
        <p id="p0185">The brain nets shown in <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> contain balls and sticks that represent, respectively, the brain regions and the connectivity between regions. With 116 brain regions involved in the CPM procedure, the maximum number of edges in a brain net would be (116 × 116 – 116)/2 = 6670. Each brain net shown in <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> contains only about 20 edged, shown as the sticks, among the possible 6670 edges. These selected edges dominated the basis on which the predictive models were derived. The brain regions connected by these dominant edges in a brain net were supposed to be more relevant to the attributes of the functional assessment score.</p>
        <p id="p0190">As seen in <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, the dominant regions seemed to be distributed in a widespread brain territory, not reflecting the infarct lesions’ localness, concentration characteristic. This phenomenon would seem reasonable if we consider that the connections affected by stroke are not only limited to the vicinity of the infarcted lesion but also between remote regions in the ipsilesional and the contralesional hemispheres (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Rehme and Grefkes, 2013</xref>) and a stroke can compromise multiple brain functions not explainable by the focal damage alone (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Dørum, 2020</xref>).</p>
        <p id="p0195">The brain net in <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>(B) is for predicting BI of Group ST patients. The dominant nodes in this brain net were more concentrated in the posterior fossa, which is related to balancing and coordination of motor functions. Balancing and coordination are important factors affecting the score of BI. Hence, it is reasonable that a brain net for predicting BI has more dominant nodes in the posterior fossa.</p>
        <p id="p0200">The brain net in <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>(C) was for predicting mRS of Group ST.R. The dominant nodes in this brain net were mostly in the right hemisphere. This phenomenon corresponds with the fact that the patients in Group ST.R had supratentorial infarction in only the right hemisphere. This phenomenon was not found in the brain net in <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>(A) for predicting mRS of Group ST patients or the brain net in Fig. R(B) for predicting BI of Group ST patients, corresponding with the fact that Group ST patients had infarction in both the right and left hemispheres. Hence, the dominant nodes tend to appear in the infarcted hemisphere.</p>
        <p id="p0205">Group BS comprised patients with infarction in the brain stem, which has complex connection to cerebellum and neurons of cranial nerves besides corticospinal tracts. This could imply that Group BS requires predictive models beyond the complexity of the CPM developed in this research. This might explain why no significant predictive model was found in this research for predicting mRS or BI for Group BS.</p>
        <p id="p0210">Limitations.</p>
        <p id="p0215">There were some limitations of this research.</p>
        <p id="p0220">The first limitation was due to the mRS score. The recruited patients were limited to those with mRS between 2 and 4 points. The resultant predictive models would not be applicable to patients that score 0, 1, or 5 points in mRS.</p>
        <p id="p0225">The second limitation was due to the sample sizes. The sample sizes of the four patient groups were 38, 26, 12 and 17. With such sample sizes, it could not be affordable to divide the patients into subgroups for analyzing some confounding factors such as age, gender, infarct size and location, and NIHSS. Besides, small sample sizes might hinder the generation of significant predictive models. This was probably the reason why only 3 were significant among the 24 predictive models that were generated in the CPM procedure in this research. Possibly more significant predictive models could be generated if there had been more patients involved in the CPM procedure. In addition, the four patient groups consisted of imbalanced numbers of different genders. The gender bias might reduce the generalizability of the significant predictive models. Moreover, a small sample size could result in overfitted predicted models. An overfitted connectome-based predictive model would contain more than adequate number of edges to account for the behavior of the population. The extra edges would reflect the peculiarity of the data used in the training procedure, i.e., the model-building procedure shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. To alleviate the effect of small sample sizes, the leave-one-out cross validation was adopted.</p>
        <p id="p0230">The third limitation was due to the discrepancy in the assessment dates. The nominal assessment dates were specified as the day of stroke onset, one month and three months after stroke onset, respectively, for Stage 1, 2, and 3. However, the real assessment dates were 0–10 days, one month ± 7 days and three months ± 7 days after stroke onset, as indicated in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. This discrepancy in the assessment dates among different patients could be a source of prediction error.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p id="p0235">This research demonstrated that the connectome-based predictive models for predicting functional recovery outcome of acute ischemic stroke can be constructed with the CPM method. In this research, using the CPM method, 48 models were developed for predicting the functional assessment scores from the functional connectivity of a previous stage. Among these prediction models, three were found significant. For the patients with supratentorial strokes, one model was found significant for predicting BI at the third stage with brain connectivity at the first stage, and another one was found significant for predicting mRS at the second stage with the brain connectivity at the first stage. In the patients with right hemispheric supratentorial strokes, one model was found significant for predicting mRS at the third stage with the brain connectivity at the second stage. For the patients with brainstem strokes, none of the predictive models was significant.</p>
      <p id="p0240">From observing these models, we found that the significant model for predicting BI contained more nodes in the posterior fossa, whose function is related to balance and coordination. The significant model for predicting mRS reveals that more significant nodes tended to be distributed in the ipsilesional hemisphere.</p>
      <p id="p0245">In summary, the CPM method is a potential tool for constructing connectome-based models for predicting the outcome of poststroke functional recovery. This method is evident-based and can be easily automated. However, the results of this research were based on small samples and hence they might not be readily applicable clinically. Provided that the predictive models are derived from and crucially validated with large samples, the predicted functional assessment scores could possibly serve as objective bases in clinical prognosis.</p>
