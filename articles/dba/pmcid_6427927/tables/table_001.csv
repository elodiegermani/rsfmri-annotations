Measure,Definition
kmax,"Degree (k) of a node is the number of links connecting one node to another in the network, and maximum degree kmax indicates the highest value of node degree in the network"
Bmax,"Betweenness centrality (B) of a node indicates the number of shortest paths passing through the normalized node such that Bùúñ[0,1], and maximum betweenness Bmax indicates the highest value of betweenness centrality in the network"
d,"Diameter (d) identifies the longest distance, measured in number of edges, between any two nodes; d has a range from 2 to N-1"
Ecc,"Eccentricity (Ecc) of a node indicates the distance of a node with respect to any other node, in term of longest distance between them. Here, Ecc represents the average value (i.e., the arithmetic mean) for all nodes"
Ass,"Assortativity (Ass) describes node tendency to link to other nodes, characterized by the same or similar degree, which can be quantified by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient of the degrees of pairs of nodes connected by an edge"
K,"Degree divergence (K) is a measure of broadness of the degree distribution in the whole network, defined as the ratio between the variability and the average of node connections"
Lf,"Leaf fraction (Lf) is the ratio between the number of nodes with only one edge (i.e., ‚Äúend-points‚Äù in the graph) and the maximum possible number of edges (i.e., the number of nodes minus 1, N-1). Stars-type graph is defined by Lf = (N-1)/(N-1) = 1, while linear-type graph by Lf = 2/(N-1)"
