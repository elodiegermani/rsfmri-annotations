        <p>Pharmacological, optogenetic, and chemogenetic modulation of neuronal excitability of the dorsal, but not the ventral, hippocampus induces analgesia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.</p>

        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Accumulating evidence suggests hippocampal impairment under the chronic pain phenotype. However, it is unknown whether neuropathic behaviors are related to dysfunction of the hippocampal circuitry. Here, we enhanced hippocampal activity by pharmacological, optogenetic, and chemogenetic techniques to determine hippocampal influence on neuropathic pain behaviors. We found that excitation of the dorsal (DH), but not the ventral (VH) hippocampus induces analgesia in 2 rodent models of neuropathic pain (SNI and SNL) and in rats and mice. Optogenetic and pharmacological manipulations of DH neurons demonstrated that DH-induced analgesia was mediated by N-Methyl-D-aspartate and μ-opioid receptors. In addition to analgesia, optogenetic stimulation of the DH in SNI mice also resulted in enhanced real-time conditioned place preference for the chamber where the DH was activated, a finding consistent with pain relief. Similar manipulations in the VH were ineffective. Using chemo-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where awake resting-state fMRI was combined with viral vector-mediated chemogenetic activation (PSAM/PSEM<sup>89s</sup>) of DH neurons, we demonstrated changes of functional connectivity between the DH and thalamus and somatosensory regions that tracked the extent of relief from tactile allodynia. Moreover, we examined hippocampal functional connectivity in humans and observe differential reorganization of its anterior and posterior subdivisions between subacute and chronic back pain. Altogether, these results imply that downregulation of the DH circuitry during chronic neuropathic pain aggravates pain-related behaviors. Conversely, activation of the DH reverses pain-related behaviors through local excitatory and opioidergic mechanisms affecting DH functional connectivity. Thus, this study exhibits a novel causal role for the DH but not the VH in controlling neuropathic pain–related behaviors.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Besides the well-known roles in memory storage and spatial navigation,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> the hippocampus also plays central roles in emotional processes, stress responses,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> fear context attribution,<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and autonomic regulation.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Accumulating evidence, over the past 2 decades, continues to demonstrate differential organization of the hippocampus along its long axis (septotemporally or dorsoventrally in rodents and posteroanteriorly in primates) regarding extrinsic and intrinsic physiological properties, anatomical inputs and outputs, as well as genetic and functional differences.<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup> A prevailing viewpoint is that the dorsal (DH) (or posterior, PH) hippocampus is better implicated in episodic memory and spatial navigation,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> and the ventral (VH) (or anterior, AH) hippocampus is a critical component of the anxiety network<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> (although components of anxiety are also captured within the DH/PH<sup><xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>). Consistent with this viewpoint is evidence of a differential increase of neurosteroid precursors in the VH (relative to the DH) and the anxiolytic effects of hippocampal neurosteroids in neuropathic pain.<sup><xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref></sup> Involvement of the DH in acute and chronic pain phenotypes is also supported: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs microinjection into the DH induces antinociception<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and also by microinjection of carbachol, morphine, and bicuculline into the DH, whereas muscimol injections enhance nociception.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In keeping with these findings, multiple hippocampal dysfunctions have been identified in rodent models of neuropathic pain, including impaired synaptic plasticity, decreased expression of N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtypes, neurogenesis, instability of place cells, and reorganization of resting-state connectivity.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref></sup> Moreover, adult hippocampal neurogenesis appears a critical mechanism controlling the transition to chronic pain,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and hippocampal expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β increases in neuropathic rats, and its expression level is positively correlated with tactile allodynia (pain-like behavior).<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> These findings are complemented by observations in human pain patients, where low hippocampal volumes seem a feature of multiple chronic pain conditions<sup><xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup> and the hippocampal volume itself appears to be a predictive factor for transitioning from subacute to chronic back pain.<sup><xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup> Thus, hippocampal physiology and connectivity undergo large adaptations with the establishment of chronic pain. Yet, how these changes influence on the ability of the hippocampal circuitry to control pain behavior remains unclear, and whether the DH and VH are differentially involved in pain phenotypes remains unexplored.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that hippocampal adaptations with the transition to chronic pain, specifically after a peripheral neuropathic injury, would enhance the involvement of the hippocampal circuitry in pain behaviors. We test this hypothesis by studying the modulation of exaggerated tactile responses in mouse and rat models of neuropathic pain, after local activation of DH or VH neurons, with microinjection of glutamate, by optogenetic excitation using channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), or by enhancing depolarizing currents chemogenetically (PSAM/PSEM<sup>89s</sup>). We use wireless optogenetics to assess sensory and affective/motivational aspects of neuropathic pain (optodriven real-time conditioned place preference [opto-rtCPP]); and in rats, we combine chemogenetic manipulations with awake resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (chemo-fMRI)<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> to identify the impact of hippocampal connectivity in the modulation of neuropathic pain behaviors.</p>

        <p>For these experiments, we used Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 to 250 g and adult male C57BL/6 mice weighing 25 to 31 g. The animals were group-housed and had free access to standard chow and water. Some of the described experiments were performed in Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, whereas others were performed in Northwestern University, Chicago. At both locations, the animals were kept at 21 ± 2°C temperature and 30% to 60% humidity, under a 12/12-hour light/dark cycle. Handling and testing were performed during the light period. To minimize stress, they were handled regularly before surgery and behavioral testing. All studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Northwestern University or by the Local Animal Care Committee (Sun Yat-sen University) and followed the ethical guidelines for the investigation of experimental pain in conscious animals.</p>

Anesthesia was continued at a lower isoflurane concentration (1.5%-2.5%) sufficient to block motor responses to pinching the hind limbs. The head fur was shaved, and the eyes covered with ointment to prevent drying out and corneal infection. After disinfecting the skin overlying the skull, the scalp was cut longitudinally, and the skin retracted from the cranium. The head post was placed at the midpoint of the bregma and lambda and fixed to the skull with dental cement. The skin wound was treated with triple antibiotic ointment. The rats were then released from the stereotaxic frame and kept warm using a heat lamp.

          <p>For awake scanning, rats first received a surgical implantation of a head post to aid stabilization during scanning.

Subsequently, snuggle sacks were adjusted around the rats for a snug fit. Once acclimated to their snuggle sacks, the rats were transferred to cradles and then secured to cradles with Velcro straps. The head plate was affixed to the head and subsequently secured to sidewalls mounted on the cradle. Rodents were then acclimated to the head restraint with a graded training procedure. Once the rats became used to the device, their head was screwed to the head-plate that was securely mounted on the cradle. To reduce the stress induced by the MRI experimental environment, rodents were exposed to digital recordings of the sounds generated by gradient switching in the magnet during fMRI, so they were familiar with loud and sudden noise that mimics a typical MRI session. Rats were habituated to the body restrain system and the MRI environment in 30-minute sessions/day for 8 to 10 days, within a 2-week period. They were first habituated to the mock scanner box that simulated the MRI scanner environment and, during later times, to the MRI scanner. Rodents were rewarded with treats at the end of each session. The acclimation training was performed after the head-post implantation and before the SNI surgery, and it was repeated after surgery prior the collection of the imaging data.</p>

We used an in-house manually drawn template to identify CSF and white matter voxels in a standard brain image. Average time courses from all the white matter and CSF as well as those pertaining to global whole brain signal were extracted using the FSL fslmeants function.

        <title>3.1 Pharmacologic manipulation of hippocampal excitability</title>
        <p>To establish the role of the hippocampus in the neuropathic pain phenotype, we first tested the effect of local injection of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (21.2 pmol in 1 µL volume) into either the DH or the VH (ipsilaterally to the peripheral SNI) on tactile allodynia in male sham-operated and SNI-operated rats. We found that glutamate injection into the DH had a potent analgesic effect in SNI where the decrease in the tactile threshold was almost completely reversed (tactile threshold increased by &gt;9 folds; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), but the same injection had minimal effects in sham rats (tactile threshold increased only by ∼20%; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.09, Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Interestingly, the effect of a single injection in SNI rats lasted for up to 2 days, after which it was fully reversed to initial allodynia levels. This pattern was fully reproduced with a second injection, a few days after recovery from the first injection, where we observed complete relief of tactile allodynia for 2 days (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Reversal of tactile allodynia with glutamate injection in the DH (ipsilateral to SNI) was replicated in female rats and also when glutamate was injected in the DH contralaterally or bilaterally relative to the SNI side (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B350" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B350</ext-link>). We also found that the effect of glutamate injection into the DH was dose dependent, reducing the dose resulted in pain relief lasting only for 1 day (5.3 pmol in 1 µL), and this analgesia was abolished if the NMDA antagonist AP5 was injected 30 minutes before glutamate (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B), thus showing that the glutamate effect requires the activation of NMDA receptors. Next, we investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of the hippocampus would modulate tactile allodynia in SNI. To this end, 2 new cohorts of rats were microinfused with indiplon (5.3 pmol in 1 µL), a positive allosteric modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors,<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> using the same DH and VH coordinates as used for the glutamate injections. In contrast with the glutamate effect, indiplon injection into the DH had no effects in SNI rats but caused a transient proalgesic effect in sham rats (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Importantly, the glutamate effect was reproducible also in SNL rats (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E), a different model of neuropathic pain.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Next, we used the same pharmacological approach to test whether the modulation of the VH similarly affects pain perception in SNI and sham rats. In contrast with the DH data, neither glutamate (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A) nor indiplon (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C) injections into the VH produced any detectable effect on tactile allodynia. Taken together, the data show a clear dichotomy between the DH and VH with regard to the modulation of neuropathy-induced tactile allodynia. However, intrahippocampal drug injections have known pitfalls that complicate the interpretation of the functional outcomes. One drawback is that the speed and extent of the drug spread are hard to predict and to measure. Consequently, the effective drug concentration is unclear, which is an important concern particularly when dealing with desensitizing receptors. In addition, the precise time constant of the effect onset and offset relative to neuronal activity may be difficult to determine.</p>

(B) Coapplication of glutamate (5.3 pmol) with NMDA receptor antagonist APV in the dorsal hippocampus (5 nmol in 1 µL volume, 30 minutes before 5.3 pmol glutamate injection) diminished the effect of glutamate on SNI-induced tactile allodynia (n = 9 rats per group).

(C) In Sham but not in SNI rats, activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the dorsal hippocampus by infusion of indiplon (positive allosteric modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, 10 pmol in 1 µL volume) decreased the tactile thresholds (n = 6 rats per group).

        <title>3.2. Optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal activity</title>
        <p>To overcome, at least in part, uncertainties associated with pharmacology, we designed a set of experiments to selectively modulate hippocampal excitability using an optogenetic approach. To this end, AAV-ChR2-GFP was injected into either the DH or the VH of sham and SNI mice (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Acute slice recordings confirmed that ChR2 was expressed and functional in hippocampal neurons (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Similar to the pharmacological manipulations, tactile allodynia was inhibited by optogenetic stimulation of the DH, but not the VH (Figs. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C and D). Thus, both pharmacological and optogenetic activation of the DH (but not the VH) reversed tactile allodynia in SNI rodents. Note the pharmacologic manipulation of the DH and VH was tested at 7 and/or 11 days after SNI/sham surgeries, whereas continuous DH or VH optogenetic activation was tested at 28 and 23 days after SNI, respectively. Although the time from peripheral injury to optogenetic activation does not match between DH and VH experiments, the DH study resulted in analgesia was at a later time (day 28); thus, the negative results seen with VH stimulation (day 23) cannot be due to virus inefficiency. More importantly, DH-dependent pain relief at 28 days after SNI suggests that the DH control of neuropathic pain is persistent for a duration where the condition may be considered transitioning to a more chronic state.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>

(B) Slice recording shows depolarization and spiking evoked in GFP-positive dorsal hippocampal neurons with photostimulation. (C) On SNI day 28, continuous photostimulation of dorsal hippocampal neurons is sufficient to relieve tactile allodynia, at around 3 hours after dorsal hippocampus stimulation (20 Hz stimulation for 15 minutes, n = 7). No effect is observed in Sham mice (n = 9). (D) On SNI day 23, a similar but smaller effect was detected with ventral hippocampus stimulation (20 Hz stimulation for 15 minutes). Hippocampal stimulation is ineffective on Sham mice (n = 5 mice per group).

        <p>Tactile allodynia, however, only represents one of many symptoms of neuropathic pain. To investigate whether other behaviors are similarly modulated, we took advantage of <italic toggle="yes">wireless real-time place preference</italic> (opto-rtCPP) experiments to test whether optogenetic stimulation of the hippocampus affects place preference in SNI mice. It should be noted that opto-rtCPP has the added advantage that both the hippocampus stimulation paradigm and behavior assessment are fully automated; thus, obtained results should be minimally contaminated with operator influences. In keeping with the findings on tactile allodynia, optogenetic activation of the DH, but not the VH, induced strong preference for the stimulated chamber in SNI, but not sham, mice (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Therefore, opto-rtCPP uncovers motivated behavior exhibiting preference for DH (not VH) stimulation only in SNI (not sham) mice. Thus, all the data concur that activation of the DH, but not the VH, improves pain-related phenotypes in neuropathic animal models, without apparent effects in sham-operated animals.</p>

        <title>3.3. Chemogenetics and functional magnetic resonance imaging</title>
        <p>To prove DH neuronal engagement in neuropathic pain and investigate the identity of the neuronal network underlying the effects induced by hippocampal modulation, we combined chemogenetic tools with awake resting-state fMRI in rats. The chemogenetic approach, in contrast to pharmacological or optogenetic methods, is a more subtle and specific assessment of the role of infected neurons in a given condition, as it tests whether unmasking of positive modulation of endogenous excitability of neurons infected by PSAM (by PSEM<sup>89s</sup>) would modify a given behavior and also identify related functional circuitry (chemo-fMRI). Thus, the approach establishes that the infected neurons are engaged in the task and that the level of their excitability (rather than direct activation) is linked to the behavior. To this end, we infected the DH bilaterally at 4 sites, hoping to improve the probability of observing behavioral and fMRI outcomes during increased excitability. First, we verified the efficiency of the viral-mediated expression of excitatory (5-HT3 channel-coupled) PSAM in the DH (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A) by testing the effect of the PSAM agonist PSEM<sup>89s</sup> (10 µM) on intrinsic excitability of infected hippocampal neurons (Figs. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B and C). Next, we activated the DH by injecting PSEM<sup>89s</sup> (30 mg/kg; i.p.). We found a robust analgesic effect (an increase in the allodynic threshold of the injured paw) in SNI rats, which was never detected in PSAM-infected rats that received saline injections or in PSEM-injected sham-operated rats (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D). Thus, chemogenetic, optogenetic, and pharmacological activation of the DH all have similar effects. Finally, we tested whether the DH effect on tactile allodynia could be linked to the activation of opioid receptors. To this end, we treated PSAM-expressing SNI and sham rats with either saline or the µ-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (5 mg/kg; 30 minutes after a 30 mg/kg PSEM<sup>89s</sup> i.p. injection; Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E). After another 30 minutes, we tested tactile allodynia. Interestingly, naloxone completely abolished the analgesic effect of PSEM<sup>89s</sup> injection, showing that the analgesic effect of DH stimulation requires the activation of µ-opioid receptors. No effect of PSEM<sup>89s</sup> or naloxone was detected in sham rats (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F).</p>

(E) Experimental timeline: Rats were first injected with AAV9-SYN-PSAM-L141F-Y115F-5HT3HC-GFP virus into the bilateral dorsal hippocampus (∼4 weeks before SNI/Sham surgeries). One day before SNI/Sham injury, tactile thresholds were assessed (baseline VF). Spared nerve injury/Sham surgeries were then performed unilaterally. Five days after surgery, tactile thresholds (−1 hour) were assessed, and afterwards, rats received PSEM<sup>89s</sup> injections (i.p.) followed by another i.p. injection of either naloxone or saline 30 minutes after. Tactile thresholds were assessed 1 hour after the first injection. Two days later, rats that had received PSEM<sup>89s</sup> and naloxone were injected with PSEM<sup>89s</sup> and saline, and vice versa, and tactile thresholds were assessed again. (F) PSEM<sup>89s</sup> injection in the virus expressed SNI rats (n = 16) showed a reduction of SNI-induced tactile allodynia. This effect was fully abolished by naloxone.

        <p>Next, we aimed to identify the brain network mediating the effect of hippocampal activation on the neuropathic pain phenotype. We paired chemogenetic activation of the DH with resting-state fMRI in awake rats, chemo-fMRI (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). Spared nerve injury rats expressing PSAM in the DH received an i.p. injection of either PSEM<sup>89s</sup> or saline; they underwent Von Frey testing and then received 2 complete resting-state fMRI scans. Because the PSEM<sup>89s</sup>-induced analgesia peaked at 1 hour after injection (Supp. Fig. S1, available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B350" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B350</ext-link>), the 2 scans were completed between 60 and 90 minutes from the injection. Three hours later, the rat cohorts were swapped so that those that had received saline injections now received PSEM<sup>89s</sup> and vice versa, and they underwent the same protocol (injection, Von Frey test, 2 scans; Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). Again, chemogenetically increasing excitability of the DH significantly blunted the SNI-induced tactile allodynia, and we then analyzed the impact of the chemogenetic activation of DH on whole brain functional network properties. We used data from both scans 1 and 2 to enhance statistical power. By examining the difference in FC of 4 seeds (PSAM injection coordinates) within the DH when the rats received either saline or PSEM<sup>89s</sup>, we identified multiple brain areas where connectivity with the DH was either increased or decreased following chemogenetically increasing excitability of the DH (Figs. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B and C). Overall, we observed twice as many connections increasing in strength than decreasing (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D). Regarding the 4 DH nodes, increased connectivity was mainly found with cortical targets, whereas decreases mostly concerned subcortical structures (Table S2, available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B350" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B350</ext-link>).

Four or 5 days after surgery, tactile thresholds (T0) were assessed, and the rats scanned for resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI); immediately afterwards, rats received either saline or PSEM<sup>89s</sup> injections (i.p.), retested for tactile thresholds, and again underwent awake rsfMRI (2 consecutive scans).

We observe the SNI hind paw ΔThreshold is negatively correlated with the average ΔFC, but not for the non-SNI hind paw. Thus, we consider this brain regional FC a reliable outcome, indicating that high FC values in the region are related with high neuropathic pain (yellow circle at z = −2.8 mm in (A)). (D and E) Two additional brain regions identified in the discovery data could be replicated (yellow circles at z = −2.0 mm and z = 2.0 mm in (A)). In both regions, dorsolateral thalamus (D) and primary somatosensory cortex (limb region) (E), discovery and replication results show a positive relationship between ΔFC and ΔThreshold for the SNI hind paw, but not for the non-SNI hind paw. Thus, in these 2 regions, high FC values (in PSEM<sup>89s</sup>) are associated with decreased neuropathic pain. Only across-seeds group averages are displayed. SNI, spared nerve injury.</p>

Both the DH and VH projected to the PAG but the VH more densely than the DH.

        <p>The DH plays a well-established role in episodic memories.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> We recently demonstrated that the valence (positive and negative value) of memory traces within the DH is mediated by glutamatergic projections from the ventral tegmental area.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Thus, this pathway may be a route for reorganizing DH circuits with neuropathic pain, specifically regarding the motivational/emotional value control, which we could demonstrate in opto-rtCPP experiments. However, activation of the ventral tegmental area is not sufficient to induce reward-related behavioral responses,<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> suggesting that other additional inputs must also be involved. Regarding DH outputs and neuropathic pain, the chemo-fMRI evidence showed that increasing DH excitability leads to increased positive and negative FC to many brain targets, and FC to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex reflected changes in tactile allodynia, likely mediated through multisynaptic pathways because there are no known direct DH projections to these regions.</p>
        <p>Although activation of the VH did not modulate neuropathic pain, other evidence suggests that it undergoes reorganization and may contribute to anxiety/depression-type behaviors commonly associated with neuropathic pain. The VH exhibits neuroimmune activation after peripheral nerve injury and enhanced anxiety in susceptible animals.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Mice with persistent neuropathic pain show reduced active neural stem cells in the VH dentate gyrus and heightened anxiety, and fluoxetine increases the proliferation of active neural stem cells and alleviates anxiety without effecting tactile allodynia.<sup><xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref></sup> Complimenting these observations, we have shown a dissociation between neuropathic pain behavior and depression-like behaviors in transgenic mice, coupled with reduced neurogenesis and diminished learning abilities.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> We have also shown that the synaptic strength of VH projections to the nucleus accumbens medial shell (D2-receptor expressing spiny projection neurons) is enhanced after SNI, and increasing excitability of these neurons exacerbates neuropathic pain.<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> However, because activation of the VH did not modulate neuropathic pain, the VH to the accumbens synapses by themselves is not sufficient to modify neuropathic behavior. Altogether, it seems that both the DH and VH undergo reorganization with neuropathic pain; the DH circuitry undergoes deactivation and exhibits ability to control neuropathic pain, whereas the VH shows increased connectivity contributing to anxiety/depression-like behaviors.</p>

        <title>4.2. Chronic pain along the long axis of the hippocampus—human studies</title>
        <p>In parallel and complimenting the rodent studies, human neuroimaging studies show hippocampal structural and functional abnormalities in various types of chronic pain.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup> Our studies indicate that hippocampal volume<sup><xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup> and positive FC from the AH to the cortex<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> are both prognostic biomarkers for transition to chronic back pain. Moreover, a subportion of AH undergoes outward shape deformation in females transitioning to chronic back pain.<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> Importantly, a specific AH-cortex positive FC changes over time in proportion to changes in back pain<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> (which parallels increased VH-accumbens connectivity in SNI); a result recently replicated using a meta-analysis approach.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Thus, the bulk of prior evidence points to AH reorganization with chronic pain. Therefore, here, we re-examined our human data specifically to contrast FC between the AH and PH. The results indicate distinct reorganization for negative FC, demonstrating opposite patterns of reorganization in the AH and PH (in similarity to rodents with SNI). Earlier results indicate in chronic back pain that a specific PH regional shape is tightly related to the mismatch between experienced pain and its memory.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Thus, it is likely that the differences we see of PH-cortex negative FC may reflect pain memory distortions in back pain.</p>

        <title>4.3. What cellular mechanisms mediate the DH effect?</title>
        <p>Our results are consistent with older observations. Rodent studies show decreased excitability of dorsal hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons and increased GABAergic activity in the formalin pain model,<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and electrical stimulation of the DH leads to antinociceptive behaviors.<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> Abnormal hippocampal glutamatergic activity<sup><xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref></sup> and decreased hippocampal long-term potentiation are observed in neuropathic rats.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> After chronic constriction injury, hippocampal CA1 glutamate concentration is decreased, whereas GABA concentration is increased and correlated with pain thresholds.<sup><xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> Also, DH inhibition of the GABAergic system by bicuculline increases antinociception, whereas muscimol promotes pronociception.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Thus, microinjection of glutamate in the dorsal hippocampus may reverse neuropathic pain by rebalancing local excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitters.</p>
        <p>Spared nerve injury animals are unable to extinguish contextual fear, which is associated with decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired plasticity.<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> This may suggest that the same DH dysfunctions that drive neuropathic pain also mediate the failure to extinguish fear. Such mechanisms include impaired synaptic plasticity,<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> likely mediated by NMDA channels.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> In keeping with the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity, rather than simple cellular excitation, is critical for this effect; our present data show that NMDA blockade prevents the analgesia observed with DH activation. In addition, the persistence of the glutamate analgesia (consistent with the reduction of glutamate and glutamate transporter levels in the hippocampus in SNI<sup><xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref></sup>) further supports a critical role of long-term synaptic regulation. The potential site of this plasticity and its polarity remain unknown, but previous work shows LTP impairment in the DH.<sup><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> Interestingly, we found that analgesic effect caused in SNI rats by activation of the DH was abolished by naloxone. Although it is likely that the µ-opioid receptor sensitivity of the DH-dependent analgesia is the result of activation of descending modulatory pathways, hippocampal plasticity itself is modulated by endogenous opioids,<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> and the 2 modulations are not mutually exclusive.</p>

        <title>4.4. Advantages and limitations</title>
        <p>The main strength of our study resides in the consistency of the results obtained using multiplicity of approaches, models, and species. Each of the 3 brain modulation techniques used has advantages and disadvantages; the major advantage of the pharmacological modulation is that it identifies molecular targets (the ligand receptors) that mediate the observed effects. A potential problem, however, is that different cell types (including glia) are simultaneously affected; in addition, it is unclear how much tissue was affected. Optogenetic stimulation is typically used to activate specific axon terminals. Here, we used it to excite local cell bodies; it may be argued that our optogenetic results share some of the same concerns as in the pharmacological approach. A critical advantage of our experimental design was <italic toggle="yes">wireless</italic> optogenetic stimulation to assess <italic toggle="yes">real-time place</italic> preference. This approach allows assessing rodents' behavior in more physiological conditions than the traditional fiber-implanted systems<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and to determine the behavioral effects in real time. The chemo-fMRI approach is, to the best of our knowledge, the only one that allows the identification of changes in FC caused by selectively increasing excitability of a specific brain area. Thus, although each of our approaches has limitations, their combined use yielding convergent evidence imparts high confidence of main results.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Over a decade ago, we launched human and rodent studies to link hippocampal processes with chronic pain based on the theoretical formulation that chronic pain may be envisioned as a state of extinction-resistant emotional learning.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Current results are consistent with this concept but only indirectly. Our primary conclusion is that the DH is deactivated with neuropathic pain, which unmasks DH control of both tactile allodynia and motivational/affective properties of neuropathic pain. Thus, the DH/PH should be considered a critical hub for novel treatment options for chronic pain.</p>
