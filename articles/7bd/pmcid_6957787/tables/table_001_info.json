{"table_id": "tbl0002", "table_label": "Table 2.", "table_caption": "Demographic characteristics and neuropsychological scores of HC and MOF patients: Mean values of different variables are calculated and standard deviation are given in brackets. Neuropsychological evaluations assessed cognitive performance in four different domains: 1) Learning and memory - Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) Copy and Memory, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) Recall and Delayed; 2) Speed of information processing and attention - Stroop Word and Color, Trail Making Test parts A and B (TMT A-B), Brief Test of Attention (BTA), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT); 3) Executive functioning - Stroop Word and Color, Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (M-WCST Categories, Perseveration and Total Errors; 4) Language - Verbal Fluency Test (VFT) and Boston Naming Test (BNT). In general, for all the tests in this Table the higher scores reflect better performance (except for the M-WCST Perseveration, M-WCST Total Errors, TMT-A and TMT-B, where higher scores reflect a worse performance). Note that, in general MOF performed worse than HC, yet none of the tests provided significant group differences. * Three MOF patients and three HC did not consent to have the neuropsychological evaluation.", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_001.csv"}
