      <abstract>
        <p>Brain network models (BNMs) have become a promising theoretical framework for simulating signals that are representative of whole-brain activity such as resting-state fMRI. However, it has been difficult to compare the complex brain activity obtained from simulations to empirical data. Previous studies have used simple metrics to characterize coordination between regions such as functional connectivity. We extend this by applying various different dynamic analysis tools that are currently used to understand empirical resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to the simulated data. We show that certain properties correspond to the structural connectivity input that is shared between the models, and certain dynamic properties relate more to the mathematical description of the brain network model. We conclude that the dynamic properties that explicitly examine patterns of signal as a function of time rather than spatial coordination between different brain regions in the rs-fMRI signal seem to provide the largest contrasts between different BNMs and the unknown empirical dynamical system. Our results will be useful in constraining and developing more realistic simulations of whole-brain activity.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The development of more sophisticated models of the brain will allow us to address some of the most challenging questions in neuroscience, such as how the physical structure of the brain can give rise to behavior, consciousness, and memory. Our focus in this manuscript is on simulating the relatively slow brain signals that coordinate information transfer across large scales in the brain and that can be measured using fMRI. Previous measures used averaged measures of functional connectivity in the simulated brain signals to compare with the empirical signal. In order to extend previous findings, we use dynamic analysis techniques developed for these fMRI signals to understand more transient events that occur naturally during normal brain activity. We show that these dynamic properties are better in differentiating models from each other and from the measured brain activity. These results will be useful in constraining and developing more realistic simulations of whole-brain activity.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The complex activity patterns produced by the brain are critical for understanding behavior and the function of the central nervous system. To explain its complexity, studies have used <xref rid="def1" ref-type="def">resting-state fMRI</xref> (rs-fMRI) scans and <xref rid="def2" ref-type="def">functional connectivity</xref> (FC) analysis to describe the coordination between different brain <xref rid="def3" ref-type="def">regions of interest</xref> (ROIs) during rest, task, and other behavioral paradigms (Smith et al., <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In recent years, analysis of FC data has moved beyond looking at average statistical relationships maintained over the course of a long scan (average FC) to dynamic analysis methods that assume the coordination of brain activity changes on a moment-to-moment basis (Hutchison et al., <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Keilholz, Caballero-Gaudes, Bandettini, Deco, &amp; Calhoun, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Shakil, Lee, &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The anatomical connections of the brain are assumed to remain constant on these short timescales so that the time-varying coordinated activity plays out over the same framework of <xref rid="def4" ref-type="def">structural connectivity</xref> (SC) based on white matter connections over time (Cabral, Kringelbach, &amp; Deco, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Deco, Kringelbach, Jirsa, &amp; Ritter, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Shen, Hutchison, Bezgin, Everling, &amp; McIntosh, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The brain’s activity can be modeled as interactions of ROIs connected by a structural network, where the activity of eachROI is a function of the local state of processing plus the delayed activity of its network neighbors (Breakspear, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Sanz-Leon, Knock, Spiegler, &amp; Jirsa, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The resulting set of differential equations form a dynamical system that can be used as a generative model to simulate activity across the whole brain for a given state vector of ROI activity. Thus, <italic>dynamic</italic> FC can be thought of as the brain’s trajectory across the phase space of the underlying <italic>dynamical system</italic> (Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Deco et al., <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>Numerical simulations of this network of ROIs, known as the <xref rid="def5" ref-type="def">brain network model</xref> (BNM) (Sanz-Leon et al., <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), simulate spovntaneous neural activity in the absence of external stimuli. Without explicit external stimuli, as in rs-fMRI, there exists no time-locked measure or event that would allow for straightforward comparison across modalities. Instead, researchers have used measures that summarize activity throughout the brain, such as average FC, estimated through Granger causality or correlation, along with distance metrics or graph theoretic analysis to quantify similarity across modalities (Cabral, Hugues, Sporns, &amp; Deco, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Liang et al., <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Senden, Reuter, van den Heuvel, Goebel, &amp; Deco, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). At least 12 different BNMs have successfully reproduced the most prominent features of average FC (Cabral, Hugues, Kringelbach, &amp; Deco, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Hansen, Battaglia, Spiegler, Deco, &amp; Jirsa, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Sanz-Leon et al., <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Senden et al., <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Newer studies have tried to develop more complex BNMs to describe transient features observed in resting state, such as spontaneous switching between two FC states during rest in order to more faithfully simulate natural brain activity (Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Deco et al., <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Hansen et al., <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, as BNMs have become more sophisticated, dynamic analysis methods for rs-fMRI have also become more developed, leading to the question of which dynamical properties of rs-fMRI BNMs can reproduce. Many dynamic analysis methods have been applied to rs-fMRI and provide complementary views of the brain activity (Hutchison et al., <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Keilholz et al., <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The replication of these dynamic features using a generative model would provide new insight on how they might arise and what they could represent. At the same time, more stringent constraints based on dynamic rather than average rs-fMRI features would provide better discrimination between different models and between different parameterizations of the same model.</p>
      <p>The following study compares the dynamics observed in rs-fMRI to the results of the same analysis methods applied to two BNMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We simulate two different types of BNMs with delayed inputs, the Kuramoto oscillator model and the Firing Rate model, and then apply four of the most common <xref rid="def6" ref-type="def">dynamic analysis techniques</xref> to compare features found in the simulated data with those found in rs-fMRI scans (Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). We chose the Kuramoto and the Firing Rate models because they have been shown to be robust, have relatively few parameters to optimize, and exhibit different dynamical properties that we expect to lead to differences in analysis output (Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Deco, Jirsa, &amp; McIntosh, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Moreover, the Firing Rate model is more simplistic in the dynamics it can reproduce, and we expect it to serve as a contrast to the more complex Kuramoto model (Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). To characterize the models and compare them with empirical data, we chose four analysis techniques that test the signal for states, repeating events, or trajectories that are representative of its higher order spatiotemporal structure. We chose these techniques in order to span the spectrum of analyzing the signal by the patterns in the spatial domain and patterns in the temporal domain. In addition, we simulated models at different parameter settings in order to understand how dynamics evolve as a function of the parameter. We used this to evaluate how well the analysis techniques compared with average FC in guiding model selection.</p>

          <p>General workflow. We used DTI data to generate the length and weight matrix between ROIs of our specified atlas. Using this structural connectome, we generate data using the different neural mass models and transformed into the BOLD signal via the Balloon-Windkessel model. To compare with empirical fMRI data, scans from HCP were preprocessed and parcellated using the same atlas. The final preprocessing of filtering, global signal regression, and normalization was done jointly for all sets of data. The final data were then analyzed with each of the different dynamic analysis techniques.</p>

        <p>All BNMs are simulated on the same structural network but are different from each other on how they describe the evolution as a system of differential equations. Moreover, since both models have been shown to reproduce average functional connectivity, we hypothesize that the BNMs will show convergence on properties that relate more to their structural connectivity and divergence on properties that describe more their transient dynamical nature. This comparison also allows us to identify which elements of the BNMs explain particular dynamic processes observed in rs-fMRI, providing insight into the potential neurophysiological sources of types of dynamics. The results will identify metrics that enable the development of more realistic models as well as provide guidance toward the underpinnings of relevant signatures in rs-fMRI data.</p>

        <title>Comparisons to Average Functional Connectivity</title>
        <p>We first demonstrate that the simulated models reproduce common metrics in brain network modeling: average FC and power spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The ordering of the ROIs seen in the figure is shown in Supplementary Table 1 (see Kashyap &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and is from Cabral et al. (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The BNMs were simulated using the same structural connectivity as an input, randomly initialized and numerically integrated to evolve the state space according to each specific model. To approximate the BOLD signal, they are then passed through the Balloon-Windkessel model that converts neural signal to its hemodynamical response (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="section">Methods</xref>). The methodology and parameter values are similar to those described in Cabral et al. (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and Cabral et al. (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and comparable reproduction of results are shown in Supplementary Figure 1 (Kashyap &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). We also simulated at very high and low global coupling levels to study the effect of parameterization on the other metrics. To quantify the similarity between the simulated FC matrices and the empirical FC matrix, we calculated the correlation between the two, a method that is extensively used in previous studies (Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Senden et al., <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Correlation was 0.37 between Kuramoto and rs-fMRI FC matrices, and 0.5 between Firing Rate and rs-fMRI FC matrices. These are in the range of values reported in earlier literature in other BNMs [0.3, 0.7] (Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Senden et al., <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). As expected, these correlation values are higher values than at very high and low global coupling levels (Supplementary Figure 2, Kashyap &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Power spectra were calculated for each ROI independently, then averaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, bottom right).

        <title>Point Process/Neural Avalanche</title>
        <p>In coactivation analysis based on the point process approach, all ROIs that cross a certain activation threshold (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="section">Methods</xref>; Tagliazucchi et al., <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) are examined at each time point to identify coactivation patterns. The bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows the coactivation data obtained for the Kuramoto simulation, the Firing Rate simulation, and empirical rs-fMRI data. Each value in the matrix represents the fraction of co-occurrences between two ROIs. The matrices are compared with the respective average FC matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, top row), and all three signals show a high degree of correlation (&gt;0.9) between the two different analysis techniques. This is because average FC can be calculated by a handful of events, as shown by Tagliazucchi et al. (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Moreover, from Supplementary Figure 2 (Kashyap &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), point process/coactivation rates seem to behave identically at different parameter settings, further suggesting they are measuring similar structure in the data. The Firing Rate coactivation rates are again closer to the coactivation rates of the empirical data than the Kuramoto model, which is similar to the results observed with the average FC anaylsis.</p>

        <title>Quasiperiodic Pattern Algorithm Comparison</title>
        <p>The quasiperiodic pattern (QPP) finding algorithm estimates a recurring spatiotemporal pattern that occurs throughout resting and task states. It consists of a characteristic pattern dominated by the activation and inhibition of the regions that correspond to the default mode network (DMN) and task positive network (TPN) in a specific temporal sequence (Majeed et al., <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Majeed et al., <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Yousefi et al., <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The QPP templates obtained from the real data and from each simulation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> in a simplified format, where the color bar shows the level of activation or deactivation in each ROI as a function of time. For better visualization, please see the supplementary videos (Kashyap &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) that show the pattern as it evolves over a surface representation of the brain. The pattern in the rs-fMRI data is consistent with the QPP templates obtained previously (Majeed et al., <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Yousefi et al., <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p>

        <p>The QPP templates from the two models are very similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> top right and bottom left, correlation of 0.81), but have important differences from the empirical QPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, top left, correlation of 0.34, 0.33). In fact, the pattern in the simulated models seems to indicate a simple flip between two states, where a subset of ROIs is first active and then inactive. The boxy nature of the plot is due to the spatial ordering of the ROIs that was originally defined by their subnetwork connectivity, suggesting that these subcomponents are activating and deactivating together. The QPP obtained from the real data is more complex and demonstrates time lags between areas in addition to the alternation of states, suggesting that the power in the BOLD signal cyclically flows through a certain order of ROIs. The relative lengths of the simulated and the observed patterns are different as well. The QPP from the real data is approximately 20 s in length, in agreement with previous reports (Majeed et al., <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Yousefi et al., <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In contrast, both of the models give QPPs that are ∼12–13 s in length, despite the use of identical windows and the similar frequency content of the signals.</p>
        <p>At low and high global coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), the QPP pattern transitions from an unstructured noise-like template to a structured signal. The number of repeated patterns for a given window seems to depend on the strength of the coupling parameter for the Kuramoto model, where at higher coupling the pattern seems to shorten and repeat more often. For the Firing Model, the template pattern emerges from unstructured noise after a certain coupling strength.</p>

        <title>K-Means on Sliding Windowed Matrices</title>
        <p>To identify FC states that occur at different time points in the BOLD signal, we used k-means analysis to compare the sliding windowed FC of the real and simulated data. After k-means clustering (k = 7), we examined both the spatial composition of the resulting clusters (or states) and metrics that describe how the brain transitions between them (Allen et al., <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We have also explored cluster numbers k = 8 and 9; these are shown in Supplementary Figure 3 (Kashyap &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The results are similar across all metrics and all models. This is due to the number of actual clusters seen per individual simulation (Supplementary Figure 3, right column; Kashyap &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), which is constant across cluster numbers, suggesting that the methodology is measuring the intrinsic dynamic structure seen within the data, rather than arbitrarily dividing up the segments.</p>
        <p>The top row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> quantifies for each individual scan or simulation, starting at different initial conditions (<italic>N</italic> = 30), how many of unique states are visited, how long they dwell in each state, and how far apart (L2 Norm distance between cluster centers) these visited states are on average. The Firing Rate and the rs-fMRI each have an average of five states per individual scan and transition at similar rates, but the average distance between centroids is almost twice as large in the rs-fMRI states compared with the simulated data. Visually the Firing Rate centroids look very similar (Supplementary Figure 4, Kashyap &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), suggesting that the diversity of states encountered is still very low. The Kuramoto model produces states with similar distances between centroids as empirical data, but each instantiation seems to have fewer states compared with rs-fMRI. Most runs (66%) result in only a single state, but under certain initial conditions the Kuramoto model can exhibit transitions between two to three different states. The model also seems to dwell in these states longer than in the rs-fMRI and Firing Rate. The transition matrix for the empirical data shows that transitions are more evenly distributed between states than in the simulated data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, bottom row). The empirical rs-fMRI data have more transitions between states than in either simulated model. The Kuramoto and the Firing Rate are roughly around the same complexity seen in the transition matrices but far less than seen in the empirical signal. We quantified this by measuring the sparsity fraction by counting the number of transitions and dividing by the total number of possible transitions (Firing Rate has 0.55 transitions, Kuramoto has 0.52, and rs-fMRI has 0.86).</p>

The other parameters seem to have a nonlinear relationship with the coupling parameters as the dynamics of the system changes. None of the models have the complexity seen in rs-fMRI in terms of number of distinct states and large distances between their centers, but the one that seems the closest to the real signal is the Kuramoto model at medium coupling levels. Even though the BNMs seem to produce some state transition properties, these BNMs clearly have much simpler dynamics as compared with the rs-fMRI even when varying the parameters.</p>

        <title>Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA)</title>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> shows the reccurance plots for the empirical and simulated BOLD signal. These plots are calculated by correlating the pattern of activity at each time point with the pattern from every other time point. Diagonal lines that are parallel to the main diagonal represent repeating transistions that are seen throughout the scan, whereas vertical or horizontal blocks represent dwell periods during the scan. A cursory inspection of the three recurrence plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, top row) shows that the two models have far less repeating structure than seen in rs-fMRI. This relation is quantified by the bottom three plots that show the recurrence rate (left), entropy of diagonal lines (middle), and average length of diagonal lines (right). The reccurence rate seems to be much higher in the Kuramoto and empirical signal than in the Firing Rate model. However, the entropy and length of the lines (related to how different the states are and how long they linger) clearly separate the three datasets (bottom and right). Entropy and line length are highest in the real data and lowest in the Firing Rate simulation, with the Kuramoto simulation residing in between. The low entropy values for the Firing Rate data signify that the model does not have as many repeated trajectories as compared with the other modalitites.</p>

The reccurence rate that is most related to the number of events seen in reccurance plots is almost linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, middle column) for both models. At higher levels of coupling there seems to be a larger spread in the models (entropy rate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, right from middle column), as they seem to be more a function of initial condition than at low levels of coupling. The entropy levels and the average diagonal length seem to be much higher in rest than all of the models, suggesting longer, slower repeated trajectories in the real signal. Overall the technique is able to separate the emprical data and the models pretty robustly and shows a clear difference between the more simpler Firing Rate model and the more complex Kuramoto model, and at least one of the measures seems to vary linearly with the parameter selection.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Average Functional Connectivity and Power Spectra</title>
        <p>From previous studies using multiple models and parameterizations, it appears that certain properties of the simulated signal are most reliant upon the underlying structural connectivity rather than the model of activity used at each node (Bullmore &amp; Sporns, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Stam et al., <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In our study, these properties should be similar across models (which share identical structural connectivity) and in the real data. Average functional connectivity analysis is one of these properties. The structural connectivity matrices derived from diffusion tensor imaging and the respective functional connectivity estimates derived from resting-state fMRI have a correlation value of 0.45 as measured through our methodology, which is similar to what has been described before (Bullmore &amp; Sporns, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In fact, all three dynamical systems produce signals where functional connectivity is highly correlated with the structural input, leading to suggest that average functional connectivity is closely related to the underlying connectome. There are known differences between SC and FC; for example, an edge in FC between two nodes can be the result of a third process that drives the two structurally disconnected regions. However, most of the edges between the ROIs can be described as a function of how many white matter tracks run between them (Stam et al., <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Moreover, the frequency spectrum and the characteristic <inline-formula><mml:math id="m3"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> distribution are similar for both BNMs and the empirical rs-fMRI, suggesting that the spectrum is a property of the underlying structure of the network. The Firing Rate model reproduces the average FC better than the Kuramoto model, which might be due to overfitting since it has fewer parameters to optimize compared with the Kuramoto model. This matches well with previous reported literature where the Firing Rate model has produced FC matrices that have a large correlation (corr. = 0.8) by tweaking the input SC to maximize similarity to the output FC (Senden et al., <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Coactivation Patterns/Point Process</title>
        <p>The coactivation analysis also showed a shared feature across the empirical and simulated data. For all three datasets, coactivation patterns were strongly correlated with average functional connectivity. This is likely because functional connectivity is driven by processes that activate certain subnetworks of the SC together (Smith et al., <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This further strengthens the notion that SC and average FC are closely related. The global coupling parameter affects the coactivation rates in a similar way as for average FC, where low levels of coupling result in a very uncoordinated system, and high levels result in global networks that are highly active. Since the model parameters were chosen to fit average FC best, and it is easier to fit the Firing Rate model, it once again reproduces measures that are more faithful to empirical rs-fMRI compared with the Kuramoto model, probably for the same reason that it can better match the average FC of the empirical data. Regardless of the coupling parameters used, the coactivation patterns are similar to the average FC for both models.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>QPPs</title>
        <p>The successful detection of quasiperiodic patterns in both BNMs indicates that these network models capture at least some of the dynamical features of the brain’s activity. Unlike the previous sections of spatial metrics where the naïve Firing Rate model performed better than the Kuramoto model, the QPP templates for the two models are indistinguishable. On the other hand, there are substantial differences compared with the real QPP. The real QPP is more complex, with gradual switching at different time lags in different areas. The real QPP template is also longer in length than the ones from the BNMs, as the simulated model starts repeating itself before the end of the template. The length of the spatiotemporal pattern seems to be a function of the coupling parameter, especially in the Kuramoto model, where increased coupling leads to faster repetitions of the patterns. The overall spatial shape of the pattern (i.e., the areas involved in activation and deactivation) are quite similar across models and parameterizations, though none are as complex as the patterns in empirical data. We believe the incorporation of aspects of neural field models and Connectome Harmonics (Atasoy, Donnelly, &amp; Pearson, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Sanz-Leon et al., <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) into the existing BNMs may result in a more accurate reproduction of the spatial propagation because it would take into account surface propagation was well as network propagation. It could also be possible that the difference in QPP templates results from the unidirectionality of certain white matter connections or other properties that cannot be captured using standard tractography.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>K-Means Analysis</title>
        <p>Some dynamic properties appear to arise more from the complex interactions linked to the unique temporal description of activity in each ROI than from the underlying structural connectivity. These properties are likely to be different for each BNM, and from previous literature, the Kuramoto model has outperformed the Firing Rate model (Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The k-means algorithm on the windowed FC matrices revealed a complex network of states in the rs-fMRI data that each demonstrated distinct spatial patterns of connectivity between ROIs along with a complex web of transitions between them. In the Firing Rate model there are a similar number of states compared with rs-fMRI, but the distances between the states are much smaller compared with rs-fMRI, suggesting that it is more appropriate to consider the Firing Rate states as representing a single state artificially divided into multiple components. The state description in the Firing Rate model echoes previous findings because it is known that stable attractor states cannot be produced with only a linear set of differential equations (Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The Kuramoto model at very low levels of coupling has similarly many states that are close together. But at higher values the Kuramoto model, for some initial conditions, can produce transitions between states that are as spatially distinct as the rs-fMRI but limited to fewer states and a simpler transition matrix than the empirical signal. This suggests that BNMs can reproduce at least some of the dynamic states observed in rs-fMRI, although current models do not recapitulate the rich variety observed in empirical data. The Kuramoto model under certain parameters does better than the Firing Rate model and can produce complex state-like behavior.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Recurrence Analysis</title>
        <p>Recurrence analysis quantifies elements in the temporal structure of the data similar to clustering analysis on short FC matrices. Therefore, we predicted it to depend more on the dynamic description of the data rather than the shared spatial connectivity input. The Firing Rate model again exhibited the least complexity, the rs-fMRI data exhibited the most, and the Kuramoto model fell in between the two for the normal parameters. The empirical data have repeated trajectories that occur more often and are longer than either observed in the simulated BNMs. Out of the dynamic analysis metrics that were examined, the RQA metrics separated the three datasets the most effectively, whereas the average functional connectivity analysis exhibited the fewest differences. Moreover, the recurrence rate that quantifies the number of repeated temporal events seems to linearly depend on the coupling parameters for a certain range. This relationship is similar to average FC, which at low levels of coupling shows no structure and at higher levels of coupling shows increased network structure (Supplementary Figure 2, Kashyap &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Average FC and recurrence analysis both use correlation, except that one uses the space across rows that spans the ROIs, whereas the other uses the space of the columns that represent single time points in the BOLD data. Average FC, which examines coordination between ROIs, reveals a static network related to the input SC. Recurrence analysis that examines the time domain reveals properties that seem to be most unique to the formulation of each BNM. Recurrence analysis also is quick to compute and therefore could be a good addition to average FC as a metric for model selection, which is a very computationally intensive process. Together they can ensure that the model has roughly similar network component structure compared with rs-fMRI based on average FC, and similar temporal structure recurrence rates.</p>

        <title>Overall Discussion</title>
        <p>The goal of our exploratory study was to find better dynamic metrics to compare empirical rs-fMRI and the brain network models. We have chosen two different BNMs at three different parameterizations to provide an axis of contrast between the simpler Firing Rate model and the more complex Kuramoto model, which has been shown to reproduce more complex dynamic trajectories (Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The dynamic analysis techniques can be ordered in how much they analyze the structure in the spatiotemporal BOLD signal as a function of spatial coordination between regions or repeated temporal trajectories. The ordering in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> is not strict, but loosely goes from techniques that observe spatial patterns to those that observe temporal patterns. These two components seem to correspond to the two main components in the formulation of BNM: the structural network that provides input from connected ROIs and a description of the evolution of the state variables.</p>

        <p>The Firing Rate model outperforms the Kuramoto model on metrics that are more closely linked with spatial patterns, whereas the Kuramoto performs better on metrics that are linked with the temporal structure observed in rs-fMRI. We believe that the performance on spatial metrics, such as average FC and point process, is due to the Firing Rate model being easier to fit to the rs-fMRI because of its fewer parameters. Moreover, since average FC and the SC are similar, it is probably an easier task to match the FC output that is very closely related to the SC input. The temporal metrics reveal that the Kuramoto model has much richer dynamics than the Firing Rate model and is closer in reproducing features seen in rs-fMRI. Moreover, these differences are more likely due to the differences in the differential equation formulation of the BNM since it defines the network evolution. The BNMs seemed to perform also similarly between the QPP and the point process metric, suggesting that it might be an invariant property of all BNMs.</p>

        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p>Our modeling approach makes many simplifying assumptions that do not capture the true complexity of the brain. In the construction of the structural connectome, we assumed that all connections were bidirectional. This is a limitation of using tractography to build the structural network, since tractography cannot distinguish unidirectional connections. Moreover, estimates of fiber density for connections between regions that have very sharp angles or between regions that are spatially far apart are far lower than the true connectivity between these regions (Bullmore &amp; Sporns, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In our generative models we also assumed a homogeneity in the response of ROIs, in both their neural description, as well as their transformation using the hemodynamic Balloon-Windkessel model. Moreover, we did not simulate subcortical structures that are known to play a crucial role in the operation of the central nervous system. All these factors might change the association between dynamic metrics and the simulated BNM signal.</p>
        <p>We also examined only a single parameterization for only two BNMs. There are a variety of BNMs, some of which are likely to exhibit more complex dynamics than either the Kuramoto or the Firing Rate model (Sanz-Leon et al., <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Even different parameterizations of a single model can give rise to vastly different behavior (Hansen et al., <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). We chose to focus on the Kuramoto and Firing Rate models because of their relative simplicity, their thorough characterization, and the expectation that they would have dissimilar dynamic properties.</p>
        <p>There are also numerous dynamic analysis methods available for rs-fMRI (Keilholz et al., <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). We chose to focus on a few of the most common ones, but future work should certainly examine the use of other types of analysis to produce even more sensitive metrics. Moreover, our study does not look at methods to test these metrics and use the established correlation as distance function. We have also not explored the entire space of parameterization, so it is possible that these models can produce more realistic signals; however, based on previous results establishing these as close to optimum, the results are probably a realistic representation of their capabilities.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>We believe that either of the two more-temporal metrics, namely RQA or k-means, would be the most appropriate in evaluating BNMs in the future. The k-means approach is a stronger criterion to evaluate on, because the cluster centers as well as the state transitions between the model and the empirical signal would have to match in order to reproduce resting-state dynamics. However, the RQA approach is less computationally intensive and can used to quickly check the diversity in the temporal structure of the simulation and to assist the selection of parameters in the model. The QPP algorithm would be useful in evaluating properties of the network structure, as it seems to be common between the BNM. It probably would be more useful to evaluate models that incorporate more biophysical plausibility such as neural field models and connectome harmonics. The average FC and the point process do not reveal processes that are much more complex than the SC input, but they useful in the way they are currently used to sweep the parameters and bias the system.</p>
        <p>From the dynamic analysis perspective, the most distinguishable metric in rs-fMRI seems to be predicting the temporal structure of the signal. We already know how the different ROIs are connected as a network, but it is still a mystery how the signal evolves. BNM provides a mathematical framework for exactly how this signal might evolve, so it is appropriate to evaluate them by characterizing their temporal dynamics.</p>

        <title>Structural Connectome</title>
        <p>Using Human Connectome Project’s diffusion-weighted images (spin echo TR 5520 ms, TE 89.5 ms, flip angle 78, voxel 1.25 mm) from five random subjects (Van Essen et al., <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), we generated one average structural connectome. Tractography was performed using the freely available software MRtrix with maximum fiber length set to 250 mm (Tournier, Calamante, &amp; Connelly, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and parcellated using the Desikan-Killiany atlas (Desikan et al., <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). For each subject, their respective T1w images (TR 2,400 ms, TE 2.14, voxel size 0.7 mm) were aligned to the standard space; then the using the warping matrix we transformed the diffusion-weighted images. Probabilistic tractography then was run between each ROI and then pruned to generate 10 million fibers. To generate the estimates for the length and weight matrices from the tractography, we used the same methodology as Hagmann et al. (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The length between two ROIs was defined as the average fiber length of all fibers that went between them, and the weight was the number of fibers going between two ROIs normalized by the surface area of the receiving ROI. The atlas provides 84 cortical and subcortical ROIs, but we selected the same 66 cortical regions as in Cabral et al. (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) for comparison to previous work. The resulting matrices are shown in Supplementary Figure 5 (Kashyap &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). There are a few important differences between our tractography, the one from Hagmann et al. (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and the ideal tractography. Our current tractography, due to longer fiber lengths, has more interhemispheric connections than the one presented in Hagmann et al. (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, tractography is less sensitive to longer connections (Fornito, Zalesky, &amp; Breakspear, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and therefore the between-hemispheric connections were scaled by a factor of 4 to offset the known issue. Tractography is also less sensitive to fibers with sharp angles than to fibers with more straight angles, so for example it results in less connections between the two primary visual areas (ROIs 27–29) that have the sharpest bend in the corpus callosum (Fornito et al., <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The final weight matrix was normalized using the matrix norm function to be unit norm. The length matrix was divided by the mean conduction velocity 5.45 m/s to get the delay matrix. This set the mean delay to 11 ms in accordance with Cabral et al. (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>

          <p>The Kuramoto model is derived from an assumption that each neural population is in a closed periodic trajectory in phase space that represents its computational processing (Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It has been shown that it can then be modeled by a phasic oscillator that can be described by a single parameter, theta, that represents its location within a 2pi cycle. Inputs into these phasic oscillators perturb its trajectory, but it stays within its limit cycle. Each of these oscillators couples via the network and is driven to the same angle and thus synchronizes the oscillators as a function of the difference between the angles of neighboring oscillators.</p>
          <p>The Firing Rate model assumes that the mean firing rate of the neural populations is distributed in a Gaussian manner. This assertion is in accordance with the central limit theorem, which states that the sum of uncorrelated random processes converges to a Gaussian probability distribution, even if the individual processes are highly non-Gaussian. Inputs into this neural mass shift the mean firing rate to a higher firing rate. The mass shifted from its equilibrium tries to relax at the rate proportional to its own firing rate, keeping the system stable via negative feedback.</p>
          <p>For each model, the differential equations were numerically integrated with a time step function of 0.1 ms for a duration of 15 min to match the length of an HCP rs-fMRI scan. The first 20 s are thrown away to avoid transient effects from initial conditions. The choices for the values for all the parameters given in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> follow previous work by Cabral et al. (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and Cabral et al. (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), except that the values for k are slightly different than the ones in the paper to account for differences in the structural connectivity matrix. The values were slightly smaller for the Kuramoto (13 instead of 18) because there were more numerous connections in the newer tractography. The low coupling models were simulated for the Firing Rate at k = 0.3. The Kuramoto model had a low coupling of 3. The high coupling models were simulated at k = 60 for Kuramoto and k = 0.999 for Firing Rate. We simulated 30 individual runs at parameterization values from previous studies, and 20 runs each at high and low global coupling levels. Simulations of functional connectivity and the intermediate steps with the original Hagmann matrices and the comparisons with Cabral et al. (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) are given in Supplementary Figure 1 (Kashyap &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p>

          <title>Converting to BOLD.</title>
          <p>In order to compare the neural simulated data with the hemodynamic response measured from fMRI, we have to convert the high-frequency activity down to the low-frequency hemodynamic response. This is performed with the Balloon-Windkessel model, which is a quadruple differential equation model that in a neuronal input and calculates the blood flow and blood volume and uses that to estimate the fraction of the oxygenated blood to the deoxygenated blood (Friston, Harrison, &amp; Penny, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Stephan, Weiskopf, Drysdale, Robinson, &amp; Friston, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Supplementary Figure 6 (Kashyap &amp; Keilholz, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) shows the impulse response of the Balloon-Windkessel model, which looks roughly like the canonical hemodynamic response function. We used the same constants for our Balloon model as those given in Friston et al. (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). After passing the output of the BNMs through the Balloon-Windkessel model, it was then downsampled to the same sampling rate as the rs-fMRI data (0.72 s).</p>

          <title>Pre-processing rs-fMRI.</title>
          <p>For the rs-fMRI data we used 30 individual HCP scans (gradient echo EPI, TR 720 ms, TE 33.1 ms, flip angle 52, voxel 2 mm) that are each roughly 15 min long. The data came from the minimally processed pipeline and then were ICA denoised using the 300 ICA vectors that HCP provides. We then applied the same Desikan-Killiany atlas as used in the tractography onto the data and obtained the mean time series for each ROI. From then on, the same processing pipeline was applied for the simulated data and the real data, in order to keep the processing as similar as possible. These steps in order were z-scoring each time series, then band passing filtering the signal from 0.01 to 0.25 Hz, then global signal regression using a linear regression model, and then applying a final z-score step. These steps were selected in accordance with Cabral et al. (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>

        <p>The point process assumes that activity in an area triggers neural avalanches in regions that are involved in the information processing (Tagliazucchi et al., <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The signal is only interpretable at either its high levels of activation or very low levels of activation when it is coordinating information transfer with other elements in the network. Later models explicitly write out the mathematical formulation using impulse response and solve for a sparse representation of these coactivation patterns, which are thought to be unique computational trajectories across the brain (Karahanoğlu &amp; Van De Ville, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Liu &amp; Duyn, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). But in this analysis, we use Tagliazucchi’s methodology by quantifying when different ROIs cross the same threshold over time. We implemented this approach by recording when the activity at a certain ROI crosses a certain threshold and then counting how many other ROIs cross the same threshold within three time steps (0.72 s) of the original crossing. We normalize the co-occurrence rates to get a fraction by dividing by the total number of crossings at each ROI. We applied this analysis with two different thresholds, one at the mean of the signal and one at 1 standard deviation away, which for our normalized signals were at 0 and 1, respectively. Prior work that has shown that average functional connectivity is primarily driven by coactivation events (Tagliazucchi et al., <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>A second approach examines the quasiperiodic patterns of BOLD signal propagation over the course of the scan. The QPP algorithm identifies the most prominent repeating spatiotemporal pattern in the signal (Majeed et al., <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Majeed et al., <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In brief, the algorithm chooses a random chunk of the rs-fMRI data (20 s of data) and correlates it with the entire scan (Majeed et al., <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Time points with high correlation to the random chunk indicate repeated occurrences and are averaged together to form the new template. This process is iterated until the template converges. Since we use a random seed point as the original template, repeated runs of the algorithm produce QPPs with different phases. Therefore, in order to compare the patterns from the rs-fMRI and the simulated models, the QPP was circularly shifted to the point where maximum correlation occurred.</p>
        <p>Sliding window correlation followed by k-means clustering was applied to examine the brain states and transitions in each set of data (Allen et al., <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Using a sliding window length of 60 × 0.72 s, the Pearson correlation was calculated pairwise for all ROIs. The window was then advanced by one time point and the process was repeated until the window reached the end of the scan. This value is around the range used in previous work (Allen et al., <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Correlation values were Fisher-transformed to better approximate a normal distribution and the k-means algorithm was applied to cluster the data into seven groups using Manhattan distance based on previous studies (Allen et al., <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Clustering was repeated 30 times, and the best resulting clustering was chosen based on minimizing the total distance from the cluster centroids and the feature vectors in order to mitigate the effects of randomly choosing the centroid locations.</p>
        <p>Recurrent analysis was performed by calculating correlation of the spatial pattern of activity pairwise across all time points. We then thresholded the values at 0.3, based on literature search, and created recurrent plots (Bassett, Nelson, Mueller, Camchong, &amp; Lim, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Cabral et al., <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These metrics were calculated using freely available MATLAB toolbox (Ouyang, Li, Dang, &amp; Richards, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and their distribution for each type of data was plotted. Recurrence rate, entropy rate, and average diagonal length were measured. The recurrence rate is the rate that similar states occur throughout the scan, as seen in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E1">Equation 1</xref>. Entropy rate quantifies the difference between repeated states, as seen in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E2">Equation 2</xref>. The average diagonal length, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E3">Equation 3</xref>, measures how long these trajectories occur. Collectively they give us an insight into how often similar states occur, how different they are from each other, and how long each of these spatiotemporal trajectories persists.<disp-formula id="E1"><mml:math id="m9"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>where</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>is</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>the</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>recurrent</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>plot</mml:mtext><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:math><label>(1)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="E2"><mml:math id="m10"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>where</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>is</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>the</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>frequency</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>of</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>diagonal</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>length</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:math><label>(2)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="E3"><mml:math id="m11"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>ln</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>where</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>is</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>the</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>frequency</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>of</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>diagonal</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>length</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:math><label>(3)</label></disp-formula></p>
