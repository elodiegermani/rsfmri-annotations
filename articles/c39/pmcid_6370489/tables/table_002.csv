Analysis technique,Description,State variable,Spatial scale,Temporal scale
Point process/neural avalanche,FC is driven by discrete events in rs-fMRI when different ROIs coactivate together,Level of activity of a single ROI,Very similar to average FC and the SC input,Coordination is seen in the shortest scales (∼ 1 s)
Quasiperiodic pattern,A specific spatiotemporal pattern observed in rs-fMRI that repeats itself over the length of the scan,Phase during the spatiotemporal pattern template,Specific nodes go through a sequence of activation and inactivation,Pattern (20 s) Occur (2/3 per min)
Recurrent quantification analysis,A sequence of similar ROI activity and/or trajectories that appear to repeat over time,Level of activity across the whole network at a single point in time,Repeating firing patterns over time,Medium (∼ 10–20 s)
K-means clustering of FC matrices,Multiple stable FC states that transition between each other,Windowed FC matrices at ∼ 45 s,Local networks embedded in the larger SC that coordinate processing for a stable period of time,Longest (45 s–1 min)
