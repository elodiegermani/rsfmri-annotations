      <abstract>
        <p><bold>Objective:</bold> Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has been used to evaluate brain network connectivity as a result of intracranial surgery but has not been used to compare different neurosurgical procedures. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is an alternative to conventional craniotomy for the treatment of brain lesions such as tumors and epileptogenic foci. While LITT is thought of as minimally invasive, its effect on the functional organization of the brain is still under active investigation and its impact on network changes compared to conventional craniotomy has not yet been explored. We describe a novel computational method for quantifying and comparing the impact of two neurosurgical procedures on brain functional connectivity.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We used a previously described seed-based correlation analysis to generate resting-state network (RSN) correlation matrices, and compared changes in correlation patterns within and across RSNs between LITT and conventional craniotomy for treatment of 24 patients with singular intracranial tumors at our institution between 2014 and 2017. Specifically, we analyzed the differences in patient-specific changes in the within-hemisphere correlation patterns of the contralesional hemisphere.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> In a post-operative follow-up period up to 2 years within-hemisphere connectivity of the contralesional hemisphere after surgery was more highly correlated to the pre-operative state in LITT patients when compared to craniotomy patients (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0287). Moreover, 4 out of 11 individual RSNs demonstrated significantly higher degrees of correlation between pre-operative and post-operative network connectivity in patients who underwent LITT (all <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Rs-fMRI may be used as a quantitative metric to determine the impact of different neurosurgical procedures on brain functional connectivity. Global and individual network connectivity in the contralesional hemisphere may be more highly preserved after LITT when compared to craniotomy for the treatment of brain tumors.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is an imaging technique that has provided significant insight into the functional organization of the brain in both healthy and pathologic states. Functional MRI is based on measurements of changes in T2<sup>∗</sup> signal that are dependent on the oxy/deoxyhemoglobin ratio; referred to as the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. Traditionally, responses to experimental paradigms have been averaged across trials to investigate the topography of specific brain functions. However, even when no cognitive, language, or motor tasks are being performed, networks of brain regions demonstrate synchronous BOLD fluctuations (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Biswal et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hacker et al., 2019</xref>). Extensive analyses of the correlation patterns of BOLD fluctuations have revealed networks such as the somatosensory, language, visual and auditory networks, among others (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, these resting-state networks (RSNs) correspond anatomically to the topography of task-based fMRI activity (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hacker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2020</xref>). In the research setting, rs-fMRI has been used to evaluate network connectivity in disease states such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, providing insight into the impact of these diseases on brain function (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Greicius et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hacker et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke have been correlated with inter-hemispheric connectivity measured using rs-fMRI. In a study of 13 patients who experienced subcortical stroke, rs-fMRI scans were taken at predetermined time points and compared with those from matched controls. The functional connectivity between the contralesional primary sensorimotor cortex and the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortex in patients who experienced stroke was found to initially decrease then increase over time and correlated with clinical recovery of motor function (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that functional connectivity and neuroplasticity can be dynamically quantified after neurologic injury using rs-fMRI. Importantly, this demonstrates that the contralateral, non-lesional, hemisphere is useful in measuring changes in RSNs from intracranial lesions. Combined with diffusion tensor imaging for tractography, rs-fMRI is an emerging tool for preoperative neurosurgical planning as well as an intra-operative navigational technique for avoidance of eloquent structures (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Dierker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Roland et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Leuthardt et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
      <p>Post-neurosurgical changes in network connectivity have been evaluated using rs-fMRI in several select applications, including after deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease, corpus callosotomy for epilepsy, and laser ablation of seizure foci (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kahan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Boerwinkle et al., 2018</xref>). In all instances of studying rs-fMRI in neurosurgical procedures, the surgical intervention was intended to modify neural circuitry and rs-fMRI was used to describe those circuitry changes. However, there has not been a quantitative approach to comparing the functional impact of multiple surgical techniques in treating similar pathologies. With new and more widespread use of minimally invasive procedures such as stereotactic laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) to treat intracranial lesions, there is a need for quantifying and comparing the functional impact on brain connectivity to that of conventional open craniotomy.</p>
      <p>LITT is a minimally invasive, ablative neurosurgical procedure that has gained significant traction over the past decade. Despite first being described by <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bown (1983)</xref> the technique has only more recently become viable due to the development of MRI thermometry, which allows for real time monitoring of temperatures distant from the laser probe (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">De Poorter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Hawasli et al., 2013</xref>). The ability to create targeted, conformal thermal lesions in a minimally invasive manner makes LITT an attractive option for treating numerous central nervous system (CNS) lesions. LITT has been described for the treatment of epileptic foci, primary and metastatic brain tumors, and radiation necrosis, with new indications continuing to be developed (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hawasli et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Torres-Reveron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Mohammadi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kamath et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bijanki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Hafez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Remick et al., 2020</xref>). For example, rs-fMRI has been used at our institution during stereotactic LITT procedures both to plan a trajectory that avoids traversing eloquent cortex and to create an ablative lesion that spares eloquent cortex (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Salehi et al., 2018</xref>). Anecdotally, LITT is presumed to be less disruptive to the overall functional brain connectivity because of the lack of brain retraction and manipulation which occur during open craniotomy, but the details of the differences in functional impact of LITT vs. standard craniotomy have not yet been quantified.</p>
      <p>In this work, we demonstrate for the first time the use of a simple yet reproducible quantitative approach using rs-fMRI to illustrate the differences in impact that two surgical approaches have on the functional organization of the brain in patients with singular intra-axial brain tumors. Specifically, we show that the within-hemisphere resting-state Pearson correlation coefficients <italic toggle="yes">contralateral</italic> to the lesion in craniotomy and LITT patients can be directly compared and quantified while overcoming the challenges of tumor mass effect and post-surgical changes and while taking into account individual patient variations.</p>

        <p>All aspects of this retrospective cohort study were approved by the Human Research and Protection Office Institutional Review Board (IRB) at our institution. Data including patient demographics, surgery types, surgery dates, radiation dates, rs-fMRI accession numbers, and tumor characteristics were retrospectively collected from patients who underwent craniotomy and/or LITT for intra-axial tumors between 2014 and 2017. Informed consent was not obtained due to the retrospective nature of the study. Treatment characteristics included whether patients underwent radiation between scans, prior stereotactic needle biopsy only, LITT, and craniotomy. Tumor characteristics included whether the tumor was intra-axial, type (metastatic or intrinsic glial neoplasm), WHO grade (if applicable), and volume (taken from radiology report). These characteristics were used to match patients between groups. Patients with evidence of bilateral tumor involvement, midline shift, or prior cranial surgery (except stereotactic needle biopsy) were excluded. Patients with post-operative imaging up to 2 years were considered. Statistical analysis of continuous and categorical variables of patient and tumor characteristics were performed using the two-tailed Student’s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test and two-tailed Fisher’s exact test, respectively, to calculate statistical significance (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>All imaging was performed with a 3T Siemens Trio scanner. Patients were instructed to keep their eyes open and look at a single focus point during image acquisition. All patients remained awake during the scans. Structural imaging included one T1-weighted MP-RAGE [repetition time (TR) = 2,000 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.5 ms, flip angle = 12°, voxel size 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm] and one T2-weighted turbo-spin echo sequence [TR = 9,000 ms, TE = 115 ms, flip angle = 120°, voxel size 1.0 × 1.0 × 2.5 mm]. Rs-fMRI was acquired using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast (TR = 2,070 ms, TE = 25 ms, flip angle = 90°, voxel size 4.0 × 4.0 × 4.0 mm). Two runs of 200 frames each (∼14 min total) were acquired in each subject.</p>

        <title>Resting-State Functional Connectivity Preprocessing</title>
        <p>fMRI preprocessing followed previously published preprocessing methods to ensure that artifacts were removed and that data was normalized (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Shulman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Leuthardt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Seitzman et al., 2020</xref>). This step corrected for head movement, normalized signal intensity across scans, and performed atlas transformation. Volumetric BOLD time series were registered to an isotropic 3 mm atlas space. In addition, spatial smoothing and voxel-wise temporal smoothing was performed for each run. Temporal frequencies &lt; 0.1 Hz were retained. Time series sampled from regions of cerebrospinal fluid and white matter were used to reduce erroneous variations by regression of nuisance waveforms derived from motion correction. The whole-brain signal was removed as a nuisance regressor. Finally, frame censoring was performed. Volumetric frames in which the root-mean-square of voxel intensities within brain regions changed significantly compared to the previous frame (&gt;0.5% of root-mean-square voxel intensities), the frame was censored to minimize the impact of head motion on functional connectivity computations. Scans were excluded if they failed preprocessing due to significant.</p>

        <title>Resting-State Functional Connectivity Analysis</title>
        <p>A publicly available set of 300 cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar ROIs,<sup><xref rid="footnote1" ref-type="fn">1</xref></sup> described in detail by <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Seitzman et al. (2020)</xref>, was used in this study (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Seitzman et al., 2020</xref>). This link also included a list of coordinates and consensus functional network labels. These ROIs and their corresponding network assignments were determined using a combination of seed-based correlation analysis and network community detection. The seed-based correlation analysis was performed to examine the spatial and temporal relationships between ROIs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In short, after image acquisition and preprocessing, the BOLD time series for each seed ROI were calculated as a correlation with all other ROIs in the brain, resulting in a Pearson’s r matrix 300 × 300 in size. Community detection was used to determine the functional network membership of each ROI using the Infomap algorithm (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the 300 ROIs were assigned to one of 14 functional network communities: default mode, frontoparietal, cinguloopercular, salience, dorsal attention, ventral attention, visual, auditory, somatomotor dorsal, somatomotor lateral, parieto-medial, striatal orbitofrontal amygdalar, medial temporal lobe, and unlabeled. Because the latter 3 networks were less well-defined in literature, we selected to examine the former 11 well-defined networks for our study. A system called the Translational Imaging Portal (TIP), a customized version of the Extensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT) imaging informatics software platform, was used to perform preprocessing and functional connectivity analysis (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Leuthardt et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

        <p>Given that postsurgical changes such as edema, pneumocephalus, hemorrhage, craniotomy plating systems, and other sources of artifact can produce noise that can significantly alter the BOLD signal, the entire hemisphere ipsilateral to the tumor was excluded in the correlation analysis.

        <p>Histograms were generated to illustrate the group-wise 2-dimensional correlation coefficients of the pre-operative and post-operative contralesional hemispheres (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) and 11 RSNs (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) among patients who underwent craniotomy and those who underwent LITT. A correlation coefficient closer to 1 implies a network that is more similar to that of the pre-operative state. In our primary analysis, we found that the contralesional hemisphere showed a significantly higher degree of correlation between pre-operative and post-operative connectivity in the patients who underwent LITT compared to those who underwent craniotomy (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0287).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>LITT has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of intracranial lesions (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). We have previously reported the outcomes and safety profile in using LITT as a frontline treatment for glioblastomas, metastases, low grade gliomas, epileptic foci, and radiation necrosis (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kamath et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Salehi et al., 2018</xref>). While the thermal effects on tissues within the ablation target and the surrounding brain have been characterized, the impact of LITT on intrinsic functional organization of the brain, and specifically when compared to craniotomy, had not yet been explored (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Mohammadi and Schroeder, 2014</xref>). Here we pilot a novel approach to quantify and compare the hemispheric and individual RSN changes from two surgical approaches while taking into account tumor mass effect, post-surgical changes, and individual patient variability. We found that relative to open craniotomy for tumor resection, LITT may have less of an impact on overall functional architecture, as measured by rs-fMRI connectivity. We found that in the follow-up period up to 2 years (average approximately 6 months) after surgery, the contralesional hemisphere and 4 RSNs showed a statistically significant difference in patients who underwent craniotomy vs. those who underwent LITT. Using this computational method, we found that the overall post-surgical brain functional connectivity in patients who underwent LITT was more similar to the pre-operative state than in patients who underwent craniotomy. These findings may not only provide evidence for the assumption that LITT may disrupt brain functional connectivity less than craniotomy, but that this analytical approach using rs-fMRI may be a useful objective tool for quantifying and comparing the effects that different neurosurgical interventions can have on the functional organization within a patient’s brain.</p>
      <p>Based on prior literature, it is reasonable to believe that rs-fMRI changes are clinically meaningful. In a longitudinal study of patients with Parkinson’s disease, for example, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Olde Dubbelink et al. (2014)</xref> found that FC changes were more pronounced in certain brain regions that corresponded to clinical measures of cognitive decline over time, which was independent from aging effects from the control group. Moreover, FC changes using rs-fMRI may also reflect the effect of therapeutic intervention. A randomized trial of cognitive rehabilitation in Parkinson’s disease found that the intervention group showed increased FC between the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left inferior temporal lobe, which correlated with measures of executive function. These effects in both FC and cognitive function were preserved at 18-month follow-up (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Díez-Cirarda et al., 2018</xref>). These findings suggest that FC may correlate with neurocognitive status and serve as a diagnostic tool to monitor clinical change over time. As the overall practice of LITT continues to grow, it is important to understand the neurophysiological and neurocognitive consequences of this technology. The extent of network disruption in LITT as it compares to open resection can have implications not only on recovery after surgery, but potentially on survival. Preservation of motor and speech function after surgery have been show to predict overall survival after glioblastoma resections (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">McGirt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gulati et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>In considering rs-fMRI and network connectivity as it relates to the intervention, several variables as it relates to surgery were taken into consideration to best enable a fair comparison between the two interventions. First, laser ablation alters blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability which may have implications on glial-neuronal interactions that drive the BOLD signal. Our previous work has shown evidence that the BBB may be disrupted by hyperthermia, that peaks at 1–2 weeks after surgery and resolves by 4–6 weeks (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Leuthardt et al., 2016</xref>). To reduce the potential effect of BBB permeability on BOLD signaling that might have unintended impact on detecting differences between RSNs, we selected scans from the most recent timepoint in order to minimize the impact of these changes when multiple post-operative scans were available. Second, the treated hemisphere is subject to a number of confounding variables that could impact network organization. The mass effect of the intracranial lesion on surrounding structures, peritumor edema, surgical plating systems, and post-surgical changes have posed challenges when studying RSNs. Prior studies investigating the changes in RSNs when there is brain asymmetry have used comparison methods using the <italic toggle="yes"><underline>contralesional</underline></italic> hemisphere only (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we used a similar approach, isolating and analyzing the within-hemisphere connectivity of RSNs of the contralesional hemisphere. This analytical technique makes the assumption that the intracranial pathology impacts the FC of the contralesional hemisphere, and importantly, this effect is indirect and nontrivial. This assumption is advantageous for the ease of mathematical analysis, but also indicates that local tissue disruption may have secondary global effects.</p>
      <p>This study has several limitations including its retrospective nature, small patient cohort, and the lack of correlations to neurocognitive outcomes that might have clinical implications as mentioned above. Direct comparison of resting-state changes between craniotomy and LITT assumes similar baseline tumor characteristics, but in clinical practice there are likely inherent differences between these treatment groups such as tumor location and tumor volume which factor into the decision of which surgery is pursued. Therefore, the main limitation of this study is the inherent mismatch between treatment groups. However, this is the first study to use a quantitative approach to comparing the effect of open and minimally invasive tumor surgery on functional connectivity and to show that LITT may be less disruptive to intrinsic networks than conventional craniotomy using rs-fMRI as a quantitative metric. We demonstrated that analyzing the within-hemisphere connectivity within the contralesional hemisphere can be a useful strategy when comparing RSNs in the setting of mass effect, and patients serving as their own control can help reduce the individual variability when comparing patient groups. Future studies are warranted and include validating these results using patient cohorts matched by tumor location, volume, and type, quantifying the time course of RSN recovery after surgery, and correlating these changes to neurocognitive outcomes.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The purpose of this study was to use a novel method to quantify and compare changes in functional network connectivity in patients who underwent craniotomy and LITT for the treatment of intra-axial brain tumors. Global hemispheric connectivity and 4 individual RSNs were more well-preserved in patients who underwent LITT than those who underwent craniotomy in a follow-up period up to 2 years. Larger studies are warranted to validate these results and to determine their clinical implications.</p>
