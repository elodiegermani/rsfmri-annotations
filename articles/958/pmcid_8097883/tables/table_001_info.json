{"table_id": "Tab2", "table_label": "Table 2", "table_caption": "Summary of included articles analysing resting-state functional connectivity in healthy participants or patients without vascular cognitive impairment. We report imaging and clinical characteristics of patients included in each study, key steps in the acquisition and pre-processing of BOLD data, analysis of functional connectivity, and FC patterns found to be associated with CSVD. Descriptive statistics as extracted from articles are reported as range (min\u2013max) and/or mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation. Missing information is indicted by empty brackets ([]). Reported are clinical characteristics of patients included in each study, details about the quantification of white matter hyperintensities, key steps in the analysis of functional connectivity, and FC patterns found to be associated with CSVD. Arrows indicate increased (\u2191) or reduced (\u2193) values, as well as positive (\u2197) and negative (\u2198) associations", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_001.csv"}
