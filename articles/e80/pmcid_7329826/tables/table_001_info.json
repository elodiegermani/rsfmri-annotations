Network diameter is the length of the longest geodesic distance between two nodes in the network. Modularity is a measure of how easily a network segregates into smaller subnetworks; large values represent networks that segregate easily into smaller communities. Mean path length is the mean geodesic distance between any two nodes in the network; smaller values are representative of more \u201ctight-knit\u201d networks. Reciprocity defines the proportion of connections in a directed graph that are mutual connections. Graph density gives the ratio of the number of connections (edges) and the number of possible connections in the network; higher values indicate that a larger number of possible connections have been made.", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_001.csv"}
