          <title>Background:</title>
          <p>Cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the two major constituents of cannabis with contrasting mechanisms of action. THC is the major psychoactive, addiction-promoting, and psychotomimetic compound, while CBD may have opposite effects. The brain effects of these drugs alone and in combination are poorly understood. In particular, the striatum is implicated in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, but it is unclear how THC and CBD influence striato-cortical connectivity.</p>

          <p>Study 1 (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 17; inhaled cannabis containing 8 mg THC, 8 mg THC + 10 mg CBD or placebo) showed strong disruptive effects of both THC and THC + CBD on connectivity in the associative and sensorimotor networks, but a specific effect of THC in the limbic striatum network which was not present in the THC + CBD condition. In Study 2 (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 23, oral 600 mg CBD, placebo), CBD increased connectivity in the associative network, but produced only relatively minor disruptions in the limbic and sensorimotor networks.</p>

          <title>Outcomes:</title>
          <p>THC strongly disrupts striato-cortical networks, but this effect is mitigated by co-administration of CBD in the limbic striatum network. Oral CBD administered has a more complex effect profile of relative increases and decreases in connectivity. The insula emerges as a key region affected by cannabinoid-induced changes in functional connectivity, with potential implications for understanding cannabis-related disorders, and the development of cannabinoid therapeutics.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cannabis is a prevalent and commonplace drug that has been used by humans for thousands of years for recreational, spiritual, and medical purposes. The pharmacology of cannabis is complex, with almost 150 known cannabinoid compounds present in naturally occurring cannabis plant matter (<xref rid="bibr39-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Hanuš et al., 2016</xref>). The two major naturally occurring cannabinoids are Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the major psychoactive compound and is responsible for the majority of the subjective and cognitive effects (<xref rid="bibr18-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Curran et al., 2002</xref>), including feeling ‘stoned’, amnesia, anxiety, and psychotomimetic effects (<xref rid="bibr20-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">D’Souza et al., 2004</xref>). THC is thought to exert its effects primarily by partial agonism at the CB1 receptor (<xref rid="bibr67-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Pertwee, 2008</xref>).

      <p>Cannabis is currently moving towards a decriminalised or fully legal status in a number of jurisdictions. There is also renewed interest in the medical uses of cannabinoids, with growth in their medical licencing (<xref rid="bibr32-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Hasin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr56-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Lucas and Walsh, 2017</xref>), particularly for the treatment of chronic and neuropathic pain (<xref rid="bibr54-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Leung, 2011</xref>) and mental health conditions (<xref rid="bibr83-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Walsh et al., 2017</xref>). As use of cannabinoids in medical contexts becomes more widespread, it is vital to understand the intricate pharmacological and physiological mechanisms behind their potential therapeutic effects. One brain system known to be strongly affected by both acute and chronic use of cannabis of particular relevance to therapeutic, recreational, and harmful effects is the dopaminergic system and associated brain regions, principally the striatum (<xref rid="bibr7-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Bloomfield et al., 2019</xref>). The density of CB1 receptors is medium to high in striatal regions (<xref rid="bibr34-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Glass et al., 1997</xref>) and previous work has shown reductions in striatal dopamine function in cannabis users (<xref rid="bibr6-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Bloomfield et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr75-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Tomasi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr79-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Van de Giessen et al., 2017</xref>), and selective dopamine release in the limbic sub-division of the striatum with an acute THC challenge (<xref rid="bibr11-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Bossong et al., 2015</xref>). Functional and behavioural data have also shown that cannabis can acutely modulate striatal responses to hedonic stimuli (<xref rid="bibr31-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et al., 2018</xref>), and impair reward learning (<xref rid="bibr52-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Lawn et al., 2016</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence implicate the striatum in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders (e.g. <xref rid="bibr45-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Howes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr50-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Karcher et al., 2019</xref>) and the nucleus accumbens in the limbic striatum in particular is the central region in influential theories of addiction (e.g. <xref rid="bibr25-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Everitt and Robbins, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr69-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Robbins and Everitt, 2002</xref>). Recent work examining the effects of cannabinoids on striato-cortical connectivity has shown a mix of effects, particularly in terms of the directionality (i.e. increases or decreases in connectivity). Both <xref rid="bibr36-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Grimm et al. (2018)</xref> and <xref rid="bibr17-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Crane and Phan (2021)</xref> report increases (with CBD and THC, respectively) while others have reported decreases (<xref rid="bibr58-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr68-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Ramaekers et al., 2016</xref>). These inconsistencies in previous studies may arise from differences in the doses, the method of administration, the analysis methods used or a number of other methodological factors. Fully characterising and clarifying the effects of THC and CBD on the striatum is therefore vitally important for understanding its role in the pathophysiology of disorders, and as a means to evaluate potential cannabinoid treatments.</p>
      <p>We therefore sought to investigate the effects of cannabinoids on functional connectivity of the striatum, using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). First, we examined the effects of vaporised herbal cannabis with and without CBD on connectivity in three striatal sub-divisions. In a second study, to isolate the effects of CBD, we investigated the effects of oral CBD versus placebo in the same regions. Our first hypothesis was that THC will disrupt/reduce striato-cortical functional connectivity particularly in the limbic striatal sub-division. Our second hypothesis was that CBD would ameliorate these effects when delivered in combination with THC, so any significant reductions in connectivity seen would be less spatially extensive in the brain. Our third hypothesis was that CBD administered alone would also reduce connectivity in these networks, but likely with a qualitatively different pattern of functional modulations of brain regions to THC or THC + CBD.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present data (from two studies, with different subjects, dosing and administration routes) collectively demonstrate extensive effects of cannabinoids on striatal functional connectivity networks. In Study 1, effects on the limbic striatum were specific to the inhaled THC condition, with disruptions (relative decreases in connectivity with the active drug condition) seen in the anterior insula, and areas of the striatum itself. Effects of the different drug conditions on associative striatal connectivity were both widespread, and somewhat dissociated, with both strains disrupting dorsal regions (anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and motor cortex), but the inhaled THC condition also specifically affecting more ventral regions (frontal operculum and insula). Regions affected in the sensorimotor striatum analysis were somewhat similar, with perhaps less of a dorsal/ventral dissociation between the two conditions. In Study 2, the effect of 600 mg oral CBD is noticeably weaker and less widespread, with disruption of connectivity in the analyses of limbic and sensorimotor seed-regions only seen in localised regions in one hemisphere (the insula/lateral frontal lobe and the cerebellum, respectively). Intriguingly, the analysis of the associative striatum connectivity in Study 2 showed a result of opposite polarity; a relative increase, or enhancement of connectivity, in parietal regions as a result of the drug administration.</p>
      <p>Overall, it is clear cannabinoids (in particular, inhaled THC) can have profoundly disruptive effects on striatal functional connectivity. The effects of 600 mg oral CBD are relatively minor when administered alone, but inhaled CBD effectively blocks or attenuates the effects of THC when administered together at a ratio of 1.25:1, in the limbic striatum. Effects of the two active treatments in the associative striatum network are broadly similar, with the main difference being a selective effect of the THC-only condition in the insula, suggesting CBD may attenuate the effect of THC specifically in the insula. In the sensorimotor striatum network, the distribution of regions affected by the two treatments is not obviously different. The finding in Study 2 that CBD actually increases associative striatum connectivity is consistent with the result in Study 1 of an ameliorating effect of the CBD on the disruptive effects of THC in the associative striatum, when administered together. The oppositional effect of CBD (i.e. increasing functional connectivity in this network) is perhaps not sufficient to fully counter the disruptive effect of THC, at least with the dosing ratio used in Study 1. The specific effect of the inhaled pure-THC (THC) condition on the limbic striatum here is mirrored by a key previous result (<xref rid="bibr11-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Bossong et al., 2015</xref>) which showed that only the limbic striatum showed reliable dopamine release with a THC challenge, indexed by [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This study used synthetic (therefore, pure) THC as the acute challenge; the present data therefore extend this result by suggesting that CBD may potentially block the release of dopamine produced by THC in the limbic striatum in cannabis containing THC and CBD. A complementary result is provided by <xref rid="bibr58-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al. (2019)</xref> who showed that THC increased glutamate concentrations in the striatum, and this was closely related to reductions in striato-cortical functional connectivity. CBD alone may also have effects on limbic striatum connectivity, as seen in Study 2, where the (right) insula is also significantly modulated by the oral CBD condition. This result is perhaps inconsistent with the interpretation developed above, but may reflect differences in the pharmacodynamics of CBD when it is administered alone compared to in combination with THC; there may be complex, perhaps synergistic, effects when administered together. Alternatively, it may reflect differences in the dosing, administration method, subjects, or other factors which differ between the two studies (see discussion of limitations below).</p>
      <p>This may be significant, as the limbic striatum consists of the nucleus accumbens and the head of the caudate. The nucleus accumbens is one of the primary substrates known to be heavily involved in the formation and maintenance of addiction (<xref rid="bibr69-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Robbins and Everitt, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr70-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Berridge, 1993</xref>, <xref rid="bibr71-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; <xref rid="bibr81-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Volkow et al., 2007</xref>). The increasing concentration of THC in modern cannabis (which also often has relatively low levels of CBD; <xref rid="bibr29-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Freeman and Lorenzetti, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr65-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Niesink et al., 2015</xref>) is thought to be a major factor in the increase of cannabis related-health issues, in particular dependence (<xref rid="bibr30-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Freeman and Winstock, 2015</xref>). The finding here that CBD blocks the disruptive effect on limbic striatum connectivity is also consistent with previous behavioural work showing that CBD attenuates the appetitive and incentive-salience effects of THC and other drugs (<xref rid="bibr44-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Hindocha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr64-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, these various findings suggest a possible physiological mechanism whereby THC promotes dopamine release in the ventral striatum (possibly via the increase in glutamate concentrations reported by <xref rid="bibr58-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 2019</xref>), making users who consume relatively pure-THC strains vulnerable to addiction. However, in users of more balanced strains containing CBD, the acute dopaminergic and addiction-promoting effects of THC on the ventral striatum may be ameliorated, or perhaps blocked entirely. This ‘buffering’ effect of CBD is also consistent with the previous results reported from this (Study 1) cohort (<xref rid="bibr31-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr52-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Lawn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr82-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Wall et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
      <p>The finding of a relative increase in connectivity with the CBD condition (in the associative striatum analysis; Study 2) is mirrored by a recent similar finding in <xref rid="bibr36-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Grimm et al. (2018)</xref>, which also used oral administration and the same dose as the present data (600 mg oral CBD). These authors showed a relative increase in frontal-striatal connectivity with CBD, and speculate that this might account for the antipsychotic effects of CBD, as fronto-striatal connectivity effects are a common finding in studies of schizophrenic patients (e.g. <xref rid="bibr26-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Fornito et al., 2013</xref>). Another converging result is that of <xref rid="bibr72-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Rzepa et al. (2016)</xref> which used the CB1 neutral antagonist tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV). This study showed increased connectivity within the executive control network; usually conceived as a network sub-serving attentional and cognitive processes involved in task engagement. CBD also may be a negative allosteric modulator at CB1 receptors (<xref rid="bibr13-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Chesney et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr51-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Laprairie et al., 2015</xref>), and here we show increases in connectivity in the associative striatum; the region of the striatum most associated with cognitive functions and brain regions. Recent studies in clinical populations also support this narrative, showing normalisation of striatal connectivity with a single dose of CBD in schizophrenia patients (<xref rid="bibr66-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill et al., 2021</xref>), and partial normalisation of brain responses in task fMRI paradigms with CBD in a group at high-risk for psychosis (<xref rid="bibr5-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharyya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Davies et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr84-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). One limitation of this interpretation is that the regions of the associative network which show increases with CBD in Study 2 (the posterior cingulate and posterior parietal lobe) are not the same regions which show decreases in connectivity in Study 1 (sensorimotor cortex and areas in the frontal and temporal lobes; all more anterior). Again, this inconsistency may be because of complex effects of the two compounds when co-administered, or because of methodological differences between the two studies.</p>
      <p>We also see marked effects on the insula, across all three networks examined in Study 1, and for the limbic striatum network in Study 2. The insula is a key hub in the salience network (<xref rid="bibr35-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Goulden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr74-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr77-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Uddin, 2014</xref>), and recent work using combined PET and fMRI methods has identified a link between mesolimbic dopamine systems and the salience network (<xref rid="bibr60-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">McCutcheon et al., 2019b</xref>). Previous work on the data from Study 1 (<xref rid="bibr82-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Wall et al., 2019</xref>) also showed a reassuringly convergent finding of connectivity from an insula seed-region (salience network) to part of the putamen. Connectivity between the striatum and the salience network has also been shown to be affected in psychotic disorders (<xref rid="bibr50-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Karcher et al., 2019</xref>), and striatal-salience network connectivity has been shown to be increased in individuals exposed to chronic psychosocial stressors (a key hypothesised factor in the development of psychosis; <xref rid="bibr59-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">McCutcheon et al., 2019a</xref>). Previous reported work on this cohort (Study 1) has also shown that both strains of cannabis increase the self-report of psychotic-like symptoms (including thought and perceptual distortion, and cognitive disorganisation; <xref rid="bibr63-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Mokrysz et al., 2020</xref>). Subjective effects of the CBD dose in Study 2 were minimal (<xref rid="bibr9-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Bloomfield et al., 2020b</xref>), and no measures of psychotic-like effects were acquired. Prominent theories of schizophrenia highlight the role of (striatal) dopamine in aberrant salience attribution (<xref rid="bibr46-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Howes and Nour, 2016</xref>), and this has been supported by experimental evidence from patients (<xref rid="bibr12-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Ceaser and Barch, 2016</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest a role for striatal-salience network connectivity in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders, and further suggest that compounds that specifically target these systems (such as CBD) may be useful therapeutically.</p>
      <p>The insula is a large anatomical region, and has also been implicated in a wide variety of functions apart from salience processing, including interoception, pain, emotional and empathic functions, time-perception, decision-making and auditory/speech functions (for a review, see <xref rid="bibr78-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Uddin et al., 2017</xref>). Its role in interoception is particularly well-described (<xref rid="bibr15-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Craig, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bibr16-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and may provide a plausible alternative interpretation of the effects seen here; namely that they are related to the subjects’ interoceptive awareness of the physiological effects of the drug. This interpretation may seem somewhat more prosaic; however, interoceptive and time-perception dysfunctions in the insula may also play a role in a number of disorders (<xref rid="bibr80-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Vicario et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting the findings may still be of useful clinical or therapeutic significance.</p>
      <p>To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report in human subjects of data from THC, THC + CBD and CBD acute challenges, achieved using a unified set of analysis methods, and with all comparisons performed in a placebo-controlled, double-blind design. These are important strengths as they serve to eliminate at least some of the divergence of methods used in previous studies in this area which have provided somewhat inconsistent results (<xref rid="bibr36-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Grimm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr58-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 2019</xref>). However, as the data come from two separate studies, a direct comparison between each of the treatment conditions is compromised by the use of different cohorts of subjects, and different routes of administration (inhalation in Study 1, oral dosing in Study 2), formulations (cannabis-based on Study 1, synthetic in Study 2), and doses. The different doses and administration procedures almost certainly led to differences in pharmacokinetics and overall bio-availability of the drugs. Other differences between studies were scanner model and field strength (1.5 Tesla in Study 1, 3 Tesla in study 2), data acquisition protocol and length of the scan. For these reasons, we opted not to make direct statistical comparisons between the two studies. This means that no explicit controls for these extraneous factors (scanner field strength, dosing, etc.) are required; however, it does render any comparisons between the two studies strictly qualitative. For the participants, Study 1 aimed to recruit subjects who were occasional or light cannabis users in order to minimise anxiety or other adverse reactions to the acute dose used in the study. In comparison, Study 2 sought to recruit subjects who were relatively inexperienced with cannabis or other recreational drugs (&lt;5 occasions previous use). Clearly, these are somewhat different samples, and this further constrains cross-study comparisons. Sample sizes in both studies were also relatively small, but the within-subjects design of both studies is an advantageous feature. The age of subjects in both studies is also somewhat restricted, with young adults recruited in the opportunity samples used (mean ages of 26 years and 24 years in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively). While this places limits on the generalisability of the findings to other age groups, it does accurately reflect the natural history of cannabis use, which tends to peak in late adolescence and early adulthood, and decline from the mid-20s (<xref rid="bibr22-02698811221092506" ref-type="bibr">Degenhardt et al., 2016</xref>). No explicit consideration of extraneous factors such as age, sex, alcohol and/or nicotine use was attempted; the small sample size in both studies meant that, for example, splitting the data by sex and conducting a between-groups comparison would be impractical. Clearly, these factors would be important for future larger studies to consider.</p>
      <p>Cannabinoids exert a major acute effect on striato-cortical functional connectivity, with effects on striatal connectivity with the insula particularly evident across all three drug conditions. These effects on the limbic striatum in particular, and its connectivity with the insula (and by implication, the salience network), are likely a crucial finding in our evolving understanding of the acute brain effects of cannabinoids. A key question for future research is understanding how these acute effects translate into longer-term effects in chronic users, what role these striato-cortical connections may have in the pathophysiology of cannabis use disorder and cannabis-related psychosis, and what therapeutic options might usefully target them. These questions will grow increasingly more urgent as cannabis seems likely to continue its transition to quasi-legal or fully legal status in a growing number of jurisdictions.</p>
