"Input: (1) Lmin, the minimum distance between two change points; (2) Mmax, the maximum number of changepoints; (3) κ value."
"1. For 0 ≤i≤n−Lmin+1 and i+Lmin≤j≤n+1, calculate ℒ(ti,tj)."
"2. Initialize H(tj∣0)=ℒ(tj+1,tn+1),j=0,…,n−Lmin+1."
"3. For 1≤s≤Mmax and 0≤i≤n−s−Lmin, update"
"H(ti∣s)=mini+Lmin≤j≤n−(s−1){ℒ(ti+1,tj)+H(tj∣s−1)}."
"Record the locations of s change points that yield H(t0|s), denoted by 𝒥^s."
"4. For 1 ≤ s ≤ Mmax, find"
M^=argminsH(t0∣s)+2rlog(n)κ(s+1).
The corresponding estimated switch point set is τ^=𝒥^M^.
Output: τ^ and M^.
