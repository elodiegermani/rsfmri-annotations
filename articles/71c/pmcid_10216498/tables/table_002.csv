Dieter et al. (2017) [???],"48 participants comprising healthy controls (n = 23, females =13), internet gaming addicts (n = 13, females = 2) and SNS addicts (n = 12, females = 6).",25.9,Yes,Assessment of Internet and Computer game Addiction checklist [???].,"Participants completed an Emotional Stroop Task (EST) with socially anxious, positive, negative and neutral words whilst undergoing fMRI.",No group differences in ACC activity were found.When viewing socially anxious words internet gaming addicts had reduced activity in the left middle and superior temporal gyrus compared to social network addicts.,High
Leménager et al. (2016) [???],"57 participants comprising healthy controls (n = 19, females = 12), pathological internet gamers (n = 19, females = 5) and pathological SNS users (n = 19, females = 10).",26.1,Yes,Assessment of Internet and Computer game Addiction checklist [???].,"While undergoing fMRI participants completed a self-retrieval paradigm, in which they rated the extent to which self-concept-related characteristics described their self, ideal, and gaming avatar.","When making self-reflections (vs. ideal-reflections) pathological SNS users had reduced activation in the dorsal striatum, thalamus and the inferior/middle frontal gyrus (vs. controls).Reduced activity in these regions was correlated with symptom severity.",Moderate
"Meshi, Morawetz and Heekeren (2013) [???]",31 Facebook users (females = 17).,23.1,No,Facebook Intensity Scale [???].,"While undergoing fMRI participants completed a task in which they received gains in reputation and observed the gains in reputation of another person, and a separate card task where they played for a monetary reward.",Activity in the left NAc in response to gains in self reputation (vs. observing reputation gains of others) predicted Facebook use.Whereas activation of the NAc in response to monetary gains did not predict Facebook use.,High
Nasser et al. (2020) [???],"30 Instagram users categorised as problematic users (n = 15, females = 5) vs. healthy controls (n = 15, females = 8).",21.9,Yes,Modified short Young’s Internet Addiction Test [???].,Participants completed a fMRI-based cue reactivity task with negative or positive valenced Instagram selfie images and neutral landscape image cues.,Negatively valenced cues produced increased activation of the precuneus in problematic users.Activation in the right MPFC in response to addiction-related cues was negatively correlated with Instagram addiction score.,Moderate
Peters et al. (2021) [???],"150 healthy adolescents and young adults (11–21 years old, females = 80).",15.7,No,,"During fMRI, participants rated themselves on 60 traits related to academic, physical and prosocial characteristics, and also indicated how their peers would judge them on the same traits.Longitudinal questionnaires assessing positive and negative outcomes were collected at 1- and 2-year follow-up.","Increased SNS use was associated with medial PFC activity during self-judgements (vs. reflected-peer-judgements), and increased activity when making judgements about physical traits.SNS use or medial PFC activity had no long-term effect on clinical symptoms, prosocial behaviour or self-concept clarity.",High
Sherman et al. (2016) [???] a,32 Instagram users (females = 18).,16.8,No,,"Participants completed a paradigm that simulated Instagram use whilst undergoing fMRI.‘Instagram photos’ were displayed (including some of the participants own photos), and each appeared with a high or low number of likes.Participants decided whether to like each photo or move on.","Viewing photos with a high number of likes was associated with increased activity in the precuneus, MPFC, left temporal pole, lateral occipital cortex, hippocampus, NAc, caudate, putamen and thalamus.Participants had greater activity in bilateral NAc when viewing own photos with many likes.Decreased activity in regions implicated in cognitive control was found when participants viewed risky photos.",High
"Sherman, Greenfield et al. (2018) [???] a","58 Instagram users, comprising 32 high school (females = 18) and 26 university students (females = 17).",16.8 vs. 19.9,No,,The fMRI task was the same as Sherman et al. [???].,"Replicating Sherman et al. [???], university students showed greater bilateral NAc activity when viewing their own photos that had received many likes.Bilateral NAc activity increased linearly with age in the high school sample, but not in the university sample.Viewing risky images was not associated with decreased activity in regions responsible for cognitive control in the university sample.",High
"Sherman, Hernandez et al. (2018) [???] a","Same sample as Sherman, Greenfield et al. [???].",16.8 vs. 19.9,No,,"The fMRI task was the same as Sherman et al. [???]; however, in this study, the researchers examined neural responses when participants provided ‘likes’ to others, rather than when they viewed the images.","When participants ‘liked’ a photo they showed activation in the ventral striatum, vmPFC, dorsal striatum, thalamus, bilateral insula/OFC, hippocampus, amygdala, ACC, inferior frontal gyrus and the bilateral intraparietal sulcus.",High
"Su, Zhou, Gong et al. (2021) [???] b",30 TikTok users (females = 14).,23.7,No,Modified Young’s Internet Addiction Test [???].,Whilst undergoing fMRI participants were shown TikTok videos including generalised recommended videos for new users and personalised recommended videos for experienced users (taken from their personal TikTok account).Participants had not seen any of the videos before entering the scanner.,"When viewing personalised videos participants showed increased activity in parts of the DMN.Parts of the DMN also showed enhanced coupling with primary visual and auditory areas, and decreased coupling with precuneus and cingulate cortex when viewing personalised videos.",High
"Su, Zhou, Wang et al. (2021) [???] b",Same sample as Su et al. [???].,23.7,No,Modified Young’s Internet Addiction Test [???].,"The fMRI task was the same as Su et al. [???]. However, in this study, the researchers used graph theory analysis to investigate functional connectivity between ROIs within the DMN, dorsal and ventral attentional networks (DAN/VAN), the frontal-parietal network (FPN) and the salience network (SN).","Both personalised and generalised videos enhanced connectivity in the DAN-FPN-DMN pathway.Whereas personalised videos also increased connectivity in the DAN-VAN-DMN pathway.Additionally, both video types resulted in reduced coupling between the SN and VAN as well as between two subsystems in the DMN.",High
Turel et al. (2014) [???] c,20 Facebook users (females = 10).,20.3,Yes,Modified Online Video Game Addiction Scale [???].,Participants completed a Facebook-specific Go/No-Go task whilst undergoing fMRI.,"Bilateral ventral striatum activity on Facebook-go trials was positively correlated with addiction scores.However, activity in the inhibitory control system (i.e., ACC and PFC) on Facebook-No-Go trials was not correlated with addiction score.",Moderate
Wikman et al. (2022) [???],"92 healthy adolescents and young adults (17–20 years old, females = 52).",18.7,No,,Participants completed a task simulating Facebook use whilst undergoing fMRI.Participants had to agree or disagree with either neutral or controversial statements and then received positive or negative peer feedback on their opinions in the form of Facebook comments.,"Negative feedback was associated with increased VLPFC, MPFC, and anterior insula activity.Positive feedback was associated with greater activity in regions including the posterior insula, TPJ, precuneus and PCC.No association with real-world SNS use.",High
Zhang and Qu (2020) [???] d,28 Weibo users (females = 14).,21.2,No,,"Participants viewed positive, negative and neutral microblog messages mimicking those on Weibo whilst undergoing fMRI.Participants decided whether to repost or not repost each microblog.","Reposting negative microblogs increased activity in postcentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and TPJ.Reposting emotionally valenced (vs. neutral) microblogs resulted in increased activity in DLPFC, insula, precuneus and TPJ.",Moderate
