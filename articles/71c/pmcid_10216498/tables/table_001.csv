"Hu, Cui et al. (2022) [???]","70 males categorised as heavy (n = 30) vs. light (N = 40) SNS users based on time spent on Weibo, TikTok, and Kwai.",20.9,No,,Participants surfed Weibo or read a science fiction novel on their phone after baseline recording and before a second fMRI recording.,"Reading SNS posts reduced functional connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN), but increased connectivity between the DMN and visual network.",Moderate
"Hu, Yu et al. (2022) [???]","49 males recruited from the same pool as Hu, Cui et al. [???], categorised as heavy (N = 30) vs. light (N = 19) SNS users.",21.0,No,,Longitudinal design.Light SNS users were instructed to increase their use to 2 h per day for 4 weeks before undergoing a second fMRI session.,Difference in functional connectivity between two groups was attenuated after light users increased their SNS use.Increased SNS use had widespread impact on almost all brain networks.,High
Lee et al. (2021) [???] a,"88 smartphone users categorised as healthy controls (n = 49, females = 17) vs. problematic users (n = 39, females = 10).",22.6,Yes,Korean Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale [???].,Analysed ROIs in the dorsal and ventral attention network.,Problematic users had increased functional connectivity between the right middle occipital gyrus and the right intraparietal sulcus but reduced functional connectivity between the right frontal eye field and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.,High
Meshi et al. (2016) [???],35 Facebook users (females = 21).,25.7,No,Self-Related Sharing Assessment [???].,fMRI data was correlated with the degree to which participants share self-related information on Facebook.,"Functional connectivity between the MPFC and right DLPFC, CP and right DLPFC as well as between the CP and left OFC was associated with sharing personal information on Facebook.Whereas connectivity between the CP and left ATP was negatively associated with self-related sharing score.",High
Wilmer et al. (2019) [???],26 healthy SNS users (females = 15).,21.4,No,Mobile Technology Engagement Scale [???].,"Functional connectivity was assessed at ventral striatum, ventral medial PFC and DLPFC.","Higher connectivity between the ventral striatum and the ventral medial PFC was associated with greater mobile technology engagement. However, higher connectivity between the ventral striatum and DLPFC was associated with lower engagement.",Moderate
Zhang and Mo (2016) [???] b,28 Weibo users (females = 14).,21.2,No,,"Functional connectivity was assessed at MPFC, DMPFC and TPJ.After fMRI participants completed an experimental task in which they read valenced Weibo messages and decided whether to ‘repost’ or ‘not repost’ each message.","Reposting positive messages was associated with increased connectivity between right TPJ and right superior temporal lobe.Greater connectivity between left TPJ, left middle frontal lobe and right insula, and between left DMPFC and medial OFC were positively correlated with reposting negative messages.Connectivity between left TPJ and left ventrolateral OFC, and between bilateral DMPFC was positively correlated with reposting neutral messages.",Moderate
