          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Sciatica is a pain disorder often caused by the herniated disk compressing the lumbosacral nerve roots. Neuroimaging studies have identified functional abnormalities in patients with chronic sciatica (CS). However, few studies have investigated the neural marker of CS using brain structure and the classification value of multidimensional neuroimaging features in CS patients is unclear.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Here, structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was acquired for 34 CS patients and 36 matched healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed cortical surface area, cortical thickness, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (REHO), between-regions functional connectivity (FC), and assessed the correlation between neuroimaging measures and clinical scores. Finally, the multimodal neuroimaging features were used to differentiate the CS patients and HC individuals by support vector machine (SVM) algorithm.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Compared to HC, CS patients had a larger cortical surface area in the right banks of the superior temporal sulcus and rostral anterior cingulate; higher ALFF value in the left inferior frontal gyrus; enhanced FCs between somatomotor and ventral attention network. Three FCs values were associated with clinical pain scores. Furthermore, the three multimodal neuroimaging features with significant differences between groups and the SVM algorithm could classify CS patients and HC with an accuracy of 90.00%.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Discussion</title>
          <p>Together, our findings revealed extensive reorganization of local functional properties, surface area, and network metrics in CS patients. The success of patient identification highlights the potential of using artificial intelligence and multimodal neuroimaging markers in chronic pain research.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Sciatica is a pain disorder often caused by the herniated disk compressing the lumbosacral nerve roots, usually presenting as pain radiating from the low back down to the leg below the knee (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Porchet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Deyo and Mirza, 2016</xref>). About a quarter of adults in the USA have experienced low back pain in the past 3 months, and 30% of those accompanied sciatica (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2019</xref>). The global prevalence of sciatica varies from 1.2 to 43% (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Konstantinou and Dunn, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Finley et al., 2018</xref>), reflecting its ununified diagnostic criteria and diverse clinical manifestations. Pain caused by sciatica can easily progress to a chronic stage which may be either continuous or recurrent, and severely affects the quality of life and mental health (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Foster and Reddington, 2021</xref>). However, the pathophysiologic mechanisms of chronic sciatica (CS) are not clear, which restricts the development of therapeutic protocols.</p>
      <p>Previous neuroimaging studies have shown greater regional homogeneity (REHO) of the posterior cingulate (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) and lower functional connectivity (FC) between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>) in patients with CS compared with healthy controls (HCs). However, these functional abnormalities may not fully account for the pathophysiology of CS, because a large number of studies have found both functional and structural (e.g., cortical surface area) changes associated with chronic pain (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Seminowicz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Luchtmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">De Pauw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Niddam et al., 2019</xref>). Besides, multiple studies have suggested that communication between brain networks is changed in chronic pain patients, and connections across networks may reflect the presence of chronic pain (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hemington et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
      <p>Given these neuroimaging findings on chronic pain, we speculated that patients with CS may also have abnormal changes in structural properties or between-regions FC. In addition, previous studies have applied machine learning techniques to distinguish patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and HC using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) values (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). However, few studies have classified neuropathic pain patients from HC by multimodal neuroimaging features. The multidimensional neuroimaging features may serve as a bridge between clinical observations and neural mechanisms that can increase the understanding of CS as a complex and multifaceted pain-related disease.</p>
      <p>Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of CS using surface-based morphometry, local functional metric, and network FC analyses in patients with CS using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Besides, the relationships between neuroimaging measures and clinical symptom scale scores were examined. Furthermore, the diagnosability of the neuroimaging properties was evaluated utilizing a support vector machine (SVM) of machine learning techniques and neuroimaging features with significant differences between CS patients and HC.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>This study included 34 CS patients who meet the diagnostic criteria of sciatica (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2019</xref>) and 38 HC participants. Patients were recruited in the Dongzhimen Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine from December 2020 to May 2021. The study recruited participants through hospital outpatient, the WeChat official account (one of China’s popular social media platforms) of Dongzhimen Hospital, and brochures.</p>
        <p>The key inclusion criteria of CS people were: (1) 35–65 years old; (2) having unilateral radiating leg pain below the knee for more than 3 months, accompanied by a positive straight-leg raise test or corresponding neurological deficit (paresthesia, muscle weakness, or reflex abnormalities) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) confirmed disk herniation, (3) leg pain intensity on the visual analog scale (VAS) (0–100 mm) of 40 mm or higher (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 1997</xref>), (4) right-handed. The exclusion criteria were: (1) sciatica induced by other diseases than lumbar disk herniation, (2) having the severe spinal disease or severe progressive neurological symptoms, (3) having cardiovascular, liver, kidney, or hematopoietic system diseases, mental health disorders, or other severe coexisting diseases, (4) pregnant or lactating women or those planning to conceive during the trial. Additionally, 38 pain-free age- and sex-matched HCs were recruited from the same geographic area by public advertisement. All HCs also met the above exclusion criteria. In addition, HCs were asked whether had personal or family histories of pain disorders or had experienced any significant pain condition as the exclusion criteria.</p>
        <p>This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongzhimen Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (No. 2020BZYLL0803), and it was part of a study registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100044585). All participants provided written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki after study procedures were explained to them thoroughly. We collected MRI data from all participants.</p>

        <title>Clinical parameters</title>
        <p>After recruitment, the following clinical measurements were evaluated by CS patients within the day before the MRI scanning. VAS was performed to rate the extent of pain in the leg and low back. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fairbank and Pynsent, 2000</xref>) was conducted to identify self-reported function levels through examining perceived disability in 10 activities of daily living. Sciatica Frequency and Bothersomeness Index (SFBI) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Atlas et al., 1996</xref>) was used to assess the frequency and bothersomeness of sciatica with scores ranging from 0 to 24, respectively. The 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 2005</xref>) was administered to assess the quality of life in eight aspects, and the scores on the physical and mental components of the SF-36 will be summarized.</p>

        <title>Magnetic resonance imaging acquisition</title>
        <p>Magnetic resonance imaging images were obtained at a Siemens 3.0 T MRI scanner (Skyra, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a standard head coil at the Department of Radiology for Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Capital Medical University. The high-resolution T1 structural MRI (sMRI) was acquired using a gradient echo sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2,530 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.98 ms, flip angle (FA) = 7°, inversion time = 1,100 ms, field of view (FOV) = 240 mm × 240 mm, number of slices = 192, voxel size = 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm, and in-plane resolution = 256 × 256. And resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was scanned using echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: whole brain, TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 30 ms, FOV = 224 mm × 224 mm, FA = 90°, slice thickness/gap = 3.5/0.6 mm, voxel size = 3.5 mm × 3.5 mm × 3.5 mm, axial slices = 32, in-plane resolution = 64 × 64, and 240 volumes. The scan duration was 5 min for the T1-weighted image and 8 min for EPI scans for blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD)-based functional neuroimaging. We used comfortable foam pads to minimize head motion and earplugs to reduce noise interference. Before starting scanning, we instructed participants to keep their eyes closed, stay awake, avoid engaging in any specific thoughts and keep still.</p>

        <title>Quality control of magnetic resonance imaging data</title>
        <p>Visually checking image quality by a neuroradiologist (QR) to make sure there were no apparent structural abnormalities or artifacts present, and the images with head movement greater than 2 mm in any direction or head rotation greater than 1° were excluded. Two HCs were excluded from the study on account of excessive head motion (&gt;2 mm in translation or &gt;2.0° in rotation) during the rs-fMRI scanning. The two excluded participants were female, their ages were 48 and 54 years. As a result, 34 patients with CS and 36 HCs were included in further statistical analyses. Furthermore, we also extracted the mean framewise displacement (FD) (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Van Dijk et al., 2012</xref>) for each participant to measure the extent of head motion and compared them between the two groups. The Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> of non-parametric test result showed that there is no significant difference in head motion among the three groups (<italic>z</italic> = 1.575, <italic>p</italic> = 0.115).</p>

        <title>Structural magnetic resonance imaging data processing</title>
        <p>First, the ‘‘recon-all’’ command with --all --qcache options implemented in FreeSurfer (V6.0)<sup><xref rid="footnote1" ref-type="fn">1</xref></sup> was used to pre-process T1-weighted images, the key steps including motion correction, non-uniform intensity normalization, talairach transform computation, skull removal, volumetric segmentation, cortical surface reconstruction and so on. Mean cortical thickness and surface area were calculated for each of the 68 cortical regions of the Desikan-Killiany Atlas (34 per hemisphere). Cortical thickness was estimated for each participant using the distance from the white matter boundary to the corresponding pial surface (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Fischl and Dale, 2000</xref>). The cerebral surface area was calculated by mesh generation and surface triangulation. Then mean cortical thickness and surface area were extracted for each cortical region.</p>

      <sec id="S2.SS6">
        <title>Functional magnetic resonance imaging data processing and network analyses</title>
        <p>The fMRI data were pre-processed using the software MATLAB 2017 and the toolbox for Data Processing and Analysis for Brain Imaging (DPABI) (version 6.1)<sup><xref rid="footnote2" ref-type="fn">2</xref></sup> (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). For each participant’s image data, we discarded the first 10 volumes because of signal equilibrium, a total of 230 volumes for each subject were processed with the slice timing, motion correction, spatial smoothing (8-mm FWHM), and spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Then we re-sampled the data into 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm. Finally, after removing the linear trend, we applied a 0.01–0.08 Hz bandpass filter.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that ALFF was calculated without filtering during the pre-processing process, and REHO was not smoothed during the pre-processing but smoothed after it was calculated, to allow the data to be normalized, which would be conducive to statistical analysis and indicator standardization. ALFF and REHO values were calculated using the DPBAI toolbox. ALFF is used to detect the regional intensity of spontaneous fluctuations in the BOLD signal, REHO calculates the temporal homogeneity of the BOLD signal between a given voxel with neighboring voxels. These measures were selected to pinpoint the spontaneous neural activity of specific regions and physiological states of the brain. The ALFF measures the gross power of oscillations within a certain frequency range, using the DPBAI software and regions of interest (ROIs) defined by the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) ROI library. The calculation procedure: (1) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was used to convert all voxels from the time domain to the frequency domain; (2) the ALFF of every voxel was calculated by averaging the square root of the power spectrum across 0. REHO was computed based on Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (KCC) of the time series of the voxel with its nearest 26 neighboring voxels. The REHO was computed for all brain voxels.</p>
        <p>We used the software MATLAB 2017 and the DPABI (version 6.1) to extract time courses of 160 ROIs in the Dosenbach 160 atlas (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dosenbach et al., 2010</xref>). Each ROI (i.e., node) was a 5 mm radius sphere centered on the atlas coordinates, including 19 voxels in each. To derive the connectivity matrix of the brain, we computed Pearson correlation coefficients of BOLD signals between each pair of 142 ROIs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>) (Dosenbach 160 atlas exclude 18 ROIs of the cerebellum), which were then Fisher transformed to <italic>z</italic>-values. We grouped significant nodes according to a well-defined seven-network atlas derived from 1,000 healthy participants by <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Yeo et al. (2011)</xref>: sensory-motor network (SMN), ventral attention network (VAN), visual network (VN), dorsal attention network (DAN), default mode network (DMN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and subcortical network (SC). Because the limbic network nodes from the Yeo atlas were not covered by the Dosenbach 160 atlas, we defined subcortical ROIs as the SC (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

          <title>Group classification with support vector machine</title>
          <p>After revealing the significant ALFF values, surface area, and FCs in the CS group, we used these three kinds of features to accurately differentiate the 34 CS individuals from the 36 HCs. Features with different scales across different modalities were normalized to a value between 0 and 1 according to their maximum and minimum values. Then, the discriminant analysis was performed by using the SVM with a nested leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) framework. First, the C regularization parameter and the linear kernel function were optimized by performing 5-fold cross-validation on the n-1 (i.e., 69) training data. Once the optimal SVM model was obtained, it was applied to classify the left-out individual as CS or HC.</p>
          <p>The performances of a classifier were quantified using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Note that the specificity represented the proportion of the HC individuals correctly predicted, while the sensitivity represented the proportion of the CS individuals correctly predicted. Specifically, accuracy is calculated as (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FN + FP), sensitivity is defined as TP/(TP + FN) and specificity is defined as TN/(FP + TN), where TN is the number of true negatives (HC individuals correctly classified), TP is the number of true positives (CS individuals correctly classified), FN is the number of false negatives (CS individuals classified as HC individuals), and FP is the number of false positives (HC individuals classified as CS individuals). In addition, the AUC is an evaluation measure based on the ROC curve, which illustrates the performance of the classifier. The ROC curve is delineated by plotting 1-specificity and sensitivity at different thresholds, and the thresholds of each ROC curve underwent stepwise variation from 0 to 1 in each 0.1 interval. Last, the model’s performance was evaluated by computation of the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).

        <p>Thirty-four CS patients and 36 matched HCs completed the entire study.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Combining a variety of analysis methods, we demonstrated that CS patients had abnormal local neural activity, which was also reflected in the greater ALFF values of the left IFG. At a finer cortical scale, we could identify the significantly greater cortical surface area in the regions cingulate and temporal. At the resting-state functional network level, we found that CS patients showed greater FCs mainly between the SMN and VAN, especially the precentral gyrus and anterior insula. Finally, we found that multimodal combined neuroimaging features were more dominant in this disease classification performance.</p>

        <title>Greater surface area of rostral anterior cingulate and banks of the superior temporal sulcus in right hemisphere</title>
        <p>The ACC plays a vital role in the neuropathic pain effect in animals (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, increased GABAergic inhibitory control in the rACC could reduce ongoing pain and pain aversiveness caused by sciatic nerve injury (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Juarez-Salinas et al., 2019</xref>). Using fMRI and electrophysiological recording, a previous study observed plasticity changes in the cingulate cortex in rats with neuropathic pain (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2018</xref>). However, the underlying role of the ACC in CS patients is much unclear. Our study showed a larger surface area in the rACC in CS patients compared to HC, suggesting that the rACC may be related to pain-induced negative emotion in CS patients. In another neuropathic pain disease, trigeminal neuralgia patients exhibited reduced ACC surface area compared with HC (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mo et al., 2021</xref>). The controversy may stem from different neuropathological processes. In the future, we will further explore whether the enlarged surface area of ACC can be the biomarker to distinguish CS patients from other neuropathic pain disorders.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the superior temporal gyrus might be involved in pain due to mismatches between pain expectation and perception (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Smallwood et al., 2013</xref>). Patients with chronic traumatic neck pain showed a smaller cortical volume in the right superior temporal gyrus compared to HC (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">De Pauw et al., 2019</xref>). However, our study showed that CS patients have a greater cortical surface area in the right superior temporal gyrus, which may be due to the different etiologies and neuropathological processes of diseases. A study reported that patients with bipolar disorder showed a larger surface area of left bankssts, which could help distinguish them from patients with major depression, the overall accuracy was 74.3% (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Fung et al., 2015</xref>). The surface area of the right bankssts and rACC in this study were also effective in distinguishing CS patients from HC, the accuracy was 66.99%. These results suggested that disease-specific neuroanatomical features (e.g., cortical surface area) may help establish reliable distinctions between different populations (e.g., between different types of disease, between patients with HC).</p>

        <title>Frontal cortex showed greater spontaneous neuronal activity and functional connectivity’s</title>
        <p>In our study, we found significantly greater ALFF in the IFG in CS patients compared to HC. Consistent with previous studies involving aspects of chronic pain (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Buckalew et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hashmi et al., 2013</xref>), we found the neural activity of the frontal lobe was significantly greater in CS patients. IFG is the important part of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the brain region commonly associated with cognitive and emotional processing (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2007</xref>). In CS patients, the abnormal functional activity of the two brain regions may influence pain perception through heightening emotional responses to pain (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gracely et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
        <p>Consistent with a previous study, medial PFC/rACC had abnormally increased FCs with brain regions with the SMN (postcentral gyrus) in cLBP patients, and the FCs could discriminate cLBP patients from HCs with 91% accuracy (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Tu et al., 2020a</xref>). Our study found the greater FCs between the vPFC, mFC, and the precentral gyrus (SMN), indicating that communication between the frontal cortex and sensory-related regions was altered in CS patients. In addition, the two FCs were negatively correlated with the pain intensity of the leg, suggesting that the feeling of pain caused by CS is the main symptom and significantly reduces the patient’s quality of life. However, DMN connectivities in the patients with cLBP and/or pain in a lower vs. the HC showed reductions of this network in the dorsolateral PFC, medial PFC, and ACC (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>). It may be due to its small sample size (20 patients and 10 HCs) and only focus on FCs within the DMN. Based on these results, we speculated that the persistent chronic pain and associated symptoms of CS were caused by abnormalities in frontal cortex.</p>

        <title>The important functional connectivity’s were mainly between sensory-motor network and ventral attention network regions</title>
        <p>The SMN including the primary and secondary sensorimotor cortex, which receives and processes sensory information from the periphery, is thought to be the main brain network responsible for pain perception (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 2015</xref>). Abnormalities in the VAN were also widely seen in chronic pain patients with persistent diminished attention or inattention (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Moriarty et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2012</xref>). The pathological changes of basal ganglia (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Borsook et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Starr et al., 2011</xref>) and neurological dysfunction of the anterior insular cortex (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ferraro et al., 2022</xref>) in the VAN have also been reported to be involved in pain processing leading to altered pain perception. Patients with failed back surgery syndrome with chronic low back pain have greater FC in the precentral gyrus and putamen (extending to the insula) in the SMN compared to HC (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kolesar et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, the FC between SMN and VAN was higher in CS patients, especially between the precentral gyrus and anterior insula, compared with HC. In addition, patients with CLBP had greater gray matter volume in the SMN regions and greater FC between the bilateral sensorimotor cortex and sensory association cortex during pain (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). These studies may imply that enhanced cortical activity in the SMN and VAN regions also underlies the clinical pain status of CS patients. Furthermore, the precentral gyrus is a sensorimotor area that receives information projected from the basal ganglia, both of which play an important role in pain processing (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Compared to HC, complex regional pain syndrome patients displayed greater resting connectivity from the caudate to the primary motor cortex (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). Our study found a greater FC between the basal ganglia and the precentral gyrus in CS patients, indicating that pain may increase the attention of CS patients to their pain sensation, and the FC was negatively correlated with the VAS score of leg pain, we speculate that engaging the conscious attention (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aminabadi et al., 2022</xref>) of CS patients can reduce pain perception.</p>
        <p>Our study also showed the abnormal FCs within FPN and with the other networks, and previous studies have shown positively associated with pain rating changes (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2013</xref>). The frontoparietal region may play a dominant role in the formation and transmission of sensations (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Lobanov et al., 2013</xref>), and RFPN is recognized as an important network that associates with perception and pain (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Neural function activity in encephalic regions of FPN showed abnormal changes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2022</xref>), and a significantly lower FC of RFPN was observed in MWoA patients (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, we found increased FCs between FPN and SMN, and decreased FCs within FPN and with the other networks in CS patients, suggesting that FPN also plays an important role in the processing and regulation of CS pain.</p>

        <title>Multimodal metrics successfully distinguish chronic sciatica patients from healthy control</title>
        <p>In recent years, SVM techniques combined with neuroimaging metrics have been applied to differentiate pain patients from HCs and to predict the outcome of certain interventions (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bagarinao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tu et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2022</xref>). The patients with neuropathic pain and the HC were classified by the mean ALFF values of the frontal gyrus and the precuneus using the linear SVM classifier, and the classification accuracy was 86.36% between the PHN patients and HC (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). A study identified a neural marker with abnormal FC within the SMN and FPN that could discriminate MwoA patients from HC with a 91.4% accuracy rate (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tu et al., 2020b</xref>). Patients with trigeminal neuralgia exhibited reductions in cortical indices in the cingulate cortex, and these abnormal whole brain-level morphological alterations successfully enable automated trigeminal neuralgia diagnosis with high specificity (trigeminal neuralgia: 95.35%; disease controls: 46.51%) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mo et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, these studies reported that the classification performance of FCs between networks was higher than the ALFF values and cortical indices (structural features). Despite coming from various studies about different chronic and neuropathic pain diseases, these studies showed that ALFF values, inter-network FCs, and structural measurements (e.g., cortical indices) can be used as neurological features to distinguish chronic pain patients from healthy people, respectively.</p>
        <p>However, chronic pain could affect multiple brain systems and cause extensive reorganization of brain structure and function, and the results of these studies were often derived from a few modalities, ignoring the combination of multiple modalities, which may affect the performance of the machine learning classifiers. In our study, SVM was applied to combined MRI imaging features (ALFF, cortical surface area, FCs), which distinguished CS patients from HC with higher accuracy of 90.00%. The finding implies that multimodal data analysis gives better results and exhibits the best model’s performance (MCC = 0.800) than unimodal analysis. The multimodal analysis could combine the advantages of multiple imaging techniques to improve both spatial and temporal resolution and target disease neurobiomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity and provide many new opportunities to improve brain research. The identification of distinguishable or predictive neuroimaging biomarkers is needed as it can aid in diagnosis and prognosis, as well as be helpful in clinical decision-making. To date, one of the few factors that independently predict poor outcomes in sciatica is the duration of leg pain (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Konstantinou et al., 2018</xref>), the application of multimodal neuroimaging biomarkers may help to assess the disease severity of patients and progression, especially during non-painful periods, assisting clinicians in early decision making, and tailor treatment plans for patients. For instance, they could be a useful diagnostic tool when patients are unable to communicate or self-reports are otherwise unreliable. Moreover, our findings may invite future studies with larger datasets to investigate the relationship between multimodal neuroimaging biomarkers and clinical measurements and develop therapeutic biomarkers to evaluate or predict the response of potential new treatments.</p>

Second, the study covered a range of ages from 35 to 65 years, restricting the generalization of the present results to other populations. Future studies with the younger or older age range are needed to increase external validity. Third, it might be a lack of a dataset of patients with other chronic pain disorders, we could not verify the specificity of the multimodal markers. Future studies with more datasets of pain-related disease will help clarify which specific chronic pain diseases (e.g., knee osteoarthritis, low back pain) are associated with functional impairment in different brain domains. Fourth, perhaps even more importantly, clinical measurements were evaluated at a single time point (1 day before MRI scanning) which does not necessarily reflect the long-term status of an individual, other time-dependent variables on multiple time points may provide more information on the chronic pain status. Fifth, the results of the brain’s functional network are affected by different parcelation strategies. Other brain atlases are needed to further assess the reliability of the differentiation of CS individuals. Last, we acknowledged that we only recruited sciatica patients with diagnosed disk herniated disks, and it cannot distinguish if the results are due to pain, or due to the specific nature of the origins of the pain in the patient group, so our results should not be exaggerated.</p>
