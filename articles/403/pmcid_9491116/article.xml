      <abstract id="ABS1">
        <p id="P3">When exposed to the same sensory event, some individuals are bound to
have less typical experiences than others. Previous research has investigated
this phenomenon by showing that the typicality of one’s sensory
experience is associated with the typicality of their stimulus-evoked brain
activity (as measured by intersubject correlation, or ISC). Individual
differences in ISC have recently been attributed to variability in focal neural
processing. However, the extent to which these differences reflect purely
intra-regional variability versus variation in the brain’s baseline
ability to transmit information between regions has yet to be established. Here,
we show that an individual’s degree and spatial distribution of ISC are
closely related to their brain’s functional organization at rest. Using
resting state and movie watching fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we
reveal that resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) profiles can be used to
predict cortex-wide ISC. Similar region-level analyses demonstrate that the
levels of ISC exhibited by brain regions during movie watching are associated
with their connectivity to other regions at rest, and that the nature of these
connectivity-activity relationships varies as a function of regional roles in
sensory information processing. Finally, we show that an individual’s
unique spatial distribution of ISC, independent of its magnitude, is also
related to their RSFC profile. These findings contextualize reports of localized
individual differences in ISC as potentially reflecting larger, network-level
alterations in resting brain function and detail how the brain’s ability
to process complex sensory information is linked to its baseline functional
organization.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P4">The ability to interpret information from the outside world in a manner
similar to one’s conspecifics is critical to healthy human behavior. Recent
work on the neural substrates of sensory information processing has accordingly
focused on the processing of naturalistic stimuli that reflect the complex and
continuous nature of everyday experiences. One key finding from this line of
research is that rich, time-locked stimuli such as movies elicit strongly conserved
brain responses across individuals (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Hasson et al.,
2004</xref>). The extent of this stimulus-evoked brain activity is most
frequently indexed by intersubject correlation (ISC), a measure of how similar
one’s activity time course in a given brain region is to that of another
individual or group average (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Hasson et al.,
2004</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Nastase et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P5">Early research using naturalistic stimuli focused on aspects of
stimulus-evoked activity that are shared across subjects, but more recent work has
sought to understand individual differences in ISC, or why some individuals exhibit
less typical brain responses to naturalistic stimuli than others (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Finn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Finn et al.,
2020</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Gruskin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Salmi et al., 2013</xref>). Across these studies, atypical brain
responses have on several occasions been attributed to two general causes: failure
to encode stimulus-specific information (e.g., a lapse in attention causes a
subject’s gaze to deviate from the visual display) and/or idiosyncratic
intra-regional processing of the stimulus (e.g., a lesioned brain region processes
information in a unique manner). Importantly, recent studies using demanding
cognitive tasks have shown that atypical task activations reflect aberrant
inter-regional communication, rather than purely intra-regional deficits (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Hearne et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Mill et al., 2020</xref>). These findings suggest that atypical
brain responses to naturalistic sensory information might similarly be linked to
individual differences in intrinsic functional brain organization. The aims of the
present manuscript are to test this hypothesis and identify general patterns in how
the brain’s intrinsic functional organization is associated with normative
stimulus-evoked activity.</p>
      <p id="P6">Just as brain responses to naturalistic stimuli reflect individual-specific
variations on a population-general theme, the brain’s resting functional
architecture is organized into networks whose general structures are conserved from
person to person but whose fine-grained topologies and strengths serve as stable
identifiers of individuals (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Finn et al.,
2015</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>). These
networks are classically derived from resting state functional connectivity (RSFC),
which is defined as the correlation between activity time courses from any two
regions measured while the brain is not performing an explicit task. A growing
literature has shown that RSFC can be used to predict both normal and pathological
variation in model-based measures of brain activity during challenging experimental
tasks, providing compelling evidence for the idea that RSFC describes the routes
along which task-relevant information travels (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Cole
et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Hearne et al., 2021</xref>;
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Mill et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">van
den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol, 2010</xref>). However, the extent to which RSFC can
predict individual differences in model-free neural responses to naturalistic
stimuli and shed light on how inter-regional communication facilitates localized
processing of such stimuli is still unclear.</p>
      <p id="P7">To characterize how RSFC is associated with normative stimulus-evoked
activity during movie watching, we analyzed fMRI data acquired across multiple days
from healthy Human Connectome Project participants. First, we show that RSFC can be
used to predict cortex-wide ISC in new subjects and using data from held-out
stimuli. Next, we demonstrate that the resting state functional connections most
associated with ISC in a specific region vary systematically across the brain and
quantify how greater intrinsic connectivity to one region is associated with more or
less typical activity in others. Finally, we show that individual-specific RSFC
patterns are related to the spatial distribution of ISC across cortex. Taken
together, these results provide important context for interpreting atypical
responses to naturalistic stimuli and detail new relationships between intrinsic and
task-driven brain function.</p>

        <title>fMRI data</title>
        <p id="P9">FMRI data for the HCP 7T release were collected at the University of
Minnesota on a 7T Siemens Magnetom scanner during four sessions spread across
two or three days. Each day of data collection involved two resting state and
two movie-watching runs across two sessions, with one rest run and both movie
runs taking place during the same scan session and the second rest run taking
place during another. The same echo-planar imaging sequence was used for all
rest and movie scans and its key parameters are as follows: time of repetition
(TR) = 1000 ms, echo time (TE) = 22.2 ms, number of slices = 85, flip angle =
45°, spatial resolution = 1.6 mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
        <p id="P10">All four rest runs had duration of 900 TRs/15:00 min, whereas the four
movie runs had variable durations (921, 918, 915, and 901 TRs). Subjects were
instructed to fixate on a projected bright crosshair on a dark background during
the rest runs and passively viewed a series of video clips (with sound) during
each movie run. Movie runs one and three each consisted of four unique clips
from independent films, and movie runs two and four were each composed of three
unique clips from major motion pictures. The same montage of brief (1–4
s) videos was included at the end of every run for test-retest purposes. Clip
durations varied between 83 and 259 s. More information on these clips can be
found in <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Finn and Bandettini (2021)</xref> and
at <ext-link xlink:href="https://db.humanconnectome.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://db.humanconnectome.org</ext-link>. Each video
clip was preceded by 20 s of rest (during which the word “REST”
was projected against a dark background). Any TR that took place during one of
these rest blocks was discarded from all analyses. The first 20 TRs after each
rest block (corresponding to the start of each video clip) were also discarded
to prevent onset transients from biasing our intersubject correlation (ISC)
measurements (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Dosenbach et al., 2006</xref>;
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2005</xref>), leaving four movie
runs of 697, 735, 691, and 718 TRs, respectively. Finally, rest and movie runs
from the same day were normalized and concatenated, yielding one rest run (1800
TRs) and one movie run (1432/1409 TRs) for each of the two days of data
collection.</p>

        <title>Preprocessing and parcellation</title>
        <p id="P11">ICA-FIX denoised CIFTI files (e.g.,
<italic toggle="yes">rfMRI_REST1_7T_PA_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</italic>) at 2 mm
resolution were downloaded from ConnectomeDB. Briefly, these data were
pre-processed using motion and distortion correction, high-pass temporal
filtering, and MNI alignment, followed by regression of 24 motion parameters as
well as a set of independent component analysis-derived confound time courses
(<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Glasser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Griffanti et al., 2014</xref>). Because head
motion-related and other artifacts may persist in fMRI data even after ICA-FIX,
additional denoising was performed. Following recent work with HCP data (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Finn and Bandettini, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>), the average time course of all
grayordinates and its temporal derivative was regressed from each scan.
Additionally, high-motion frames were censored from all rest scans. To identify
these frames, a 0.2 Hz (12 breaths per minute) low pass filter was first applied
to each scan’s framewise displacement (FD) trace to account for
respiratory artifacts found in fMRI data (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Fair
et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Gratton et al.,
2020</xref>). Any volume exceeding 0.2 mm FD post-filtering was flagged, as
were all runs of fewer than five contiguous volumes. Finally, delta functions
corresponding to each of the censored volumes were included along with the two
global signal time courses for each rest scan’s denoising design matrix.
Frame censoring was not performed on the movie scans to ensure that ISC would be
calculated with the same TRs across individuals.</p>
        <p id="P12">Following denoising, functional data were parcellated into 360 cortical
regions of interest using the Glasser HCP-MMP parcellation (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>). The Glasser parcellation was
chosen for its anatomically specific labels, association with the HCP dataset
and CIFTI format, and compatibility with the Cole-Anticevic Brain-wide Network
Partition (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2019</xref>), whose
granular and interpretable network definitions (e.g., separate language and
auditory networks) are especially suitable for the analysis of BOLD signals
evoked by complex audiovisual stimuli.</p>

separately for both concatenated movie scans such that every participant had two

        <sec id="S9">
          <title>Overview:</title>
          <p id="P15">Ridge connectome-based predictive modeling (rCPM) was used to relate
RSFC to global ISC (gISC), defined as the average of each
participant’s 360 parcel-level ISC values. Our use of this measure as
a cortex-wide indicator of brain activity typicality is motivated by its
simplicity as well as by previous work showing global relationships between
ISC and behavior (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Gruskin et al.,
2020</xref>). CPM is an established technique for predicting behavior
(e.g., fluid intelligence, symptom severity) from RSFC (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Finn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we use a variant of
CPM, rCPM (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2019</xref>), to
predict gISC from RSFC. Although the prediction of gISC is conceptually
similar to the prediction of any other measure, gISC’s derivation
from BOLD data leaves it susceptible to motion and other fMRI acquisition
artifacts. More importantly, individual differences in these artifacts are
likely consistent across rest and movie scans such that relationships
between RSFC and gISC may be driven by artifacts rather than neural signals
of interest. Therefore, in addition to the conservative preprocessing
approach out-lined in <xref rid="S5" ref-type="sec">Section 2.3</xref>, all
correlations between RSFC and (g)ISC performed in this paper included head
motion (mean FD; calculated as the average of the filtered and uncensored FD
traces) and temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR; calculated as the
whole-brain average of the means of all grayordinate time series divided by
their standard deviations for a given subject/scan) measures as covariates,
as both of these variables were found to be correlated with gISC (mean FD:

          <p id="P16">Because the HCP 7T dataset is composed of data from individuals of
varying degrees of genetic relatedness (monozygotic and dizygotic twins,
non-twin siblings, and un-related individuals; 93 unique families), all
individuals from the same family were randomly assigned to one of two groups
of 88 (i.e., split-half cross-validation), with one group being used to
train a model that would then be tested on the other (and vice versa). The
following approach was then applied to 100 of these random splits of the
data to assess the performance of rCPM across different training/testing
sets and to build a bagged model that is more robust to overfitting (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">O’Connor et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

First, the order of the gISC and movie watching tSNR and mean FD matrices
was shuffled such that one participant’s resting state FC, tSNR, and
mean FD values were associated with the movie BOLD time courses, tSNR
values, and mean FD values from a random participant. Steps 1 through 6 from

          <title>Building and testing the bagged model:</title>
          <p id="P24">The cross-validation paradigm described in the previous two sections
was used to ask whether a model trained on data from one group of subjects
can predict gISC from RSFC in a novel group of subjects. Importantly, the
gISC values used here all come from the same set of stimuli (the Day 1 movie
clips). It could then be the case that the CV models rely on
stimulus-specific signals and may fail to predict gISC during viewing of a
different movie. A bootstrap aggregating, or “bagging,”
approach was used to test whether the 200 linear models trained on Day 1
movie watching and resting state data could predict Day 2 gISC (derived from
a different set of stimuli) from Day 2 RSFC, as previous work has shown
bagged CPM models to be more accurate and more generalizable than their
non-bagged counterparts (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">O’Connor et
al., 2021</xref>). To construct the bagged model, RSFC edges that passed
the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .01 feature selection step in at least 10%
(20/200, reflecting the 100 iterations of split-half cross-validation) of
iterations were identified, yielding 1437 edges total. Next, for each of
these edges, the ridge coefficients for a given edge across all iterations
in which that edge was selected were averaged. The average intercept across
the 200 bootstraps was then combined with the average ridge coefficients to
yield a singular composite linear model. Each subject’s Day 2 RSFC
matrix was then submitted to this model (by multiplying the correlation
coefficients of selected RSFC edges by the ridge coefficients and adding the
intercept) to generate 176 predicted gISC values, which were then Spearman
correlated with the “true” gISC values (calculated through
leave-one-out ISC using the full sample), controlling for mean FD and tSNR
in the Day 2 rest and movie scans. To characterize network-level
contributions of edges to the bagged model, the 1437 ridge coefficients were
averaged according to their corresponding edge’s network memberships
separately for positive and negative weights.</p>
          <p id="P25">To further evaluate possible relationships between nuisance
variables and gISC prediction, we divided our subjects into low- and
high-motion groups (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 88 each) using a median split of
mean FD over all four scans (median mean FD = 0.038) and repeated the above
rCPM analysis independently in each group (still controlling for mean FD and
tSNR). Finally, global intrasubject correlation (gIntraSC), measured by
correlating one subject’s BOLD time courses from two viewings of the
same stimulus and averaging correlation coefficients across parcels, could
also be considered as a measure of data quality. Taking advantage of the 83
s test-retest clip, we calculated gIntraSC values for each subject and each
day of data collection and repeated the above analysis with this new
covariate. Code for these rCPM analyses was adapted from <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/YaleMRRC/CPM" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/YaleMRRC/CPM</ext-link> (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

        <title>Inbound and outbound analyses</title>
        <p id="P26">To investigate relationships between RSFC and ISC in each of the 360
Glasser parcels, we used two related partial correlation analyses. First, we
(Spearman) correlated ISC values for a given parcel with the RSFC coefficients
for each edge involving that parcel across participants, controlling for mean FD
and tSNR in the rest and movie scans. This “inbound” analysis
describes how ISC in a given parcel is related to that parcel’s resting
state functional connections to every other parcel. Next, the
“outbound” analysis involves finding the Spearman partial
correlation between the RSFC coefficients for each connection between a given
parcel and every other parcel and ISC in those other parcels, again controlling
for rest and movie scan mean FD and tSNR. This analysis shows how a given
parcel’s resting state functional connections to other parcels are
associated with ISC in those parcels. Both the inbound and outbound analyses
yield a 360×1 map (with one undefined value for the reference parcel)
across the brain for every parcel and for each day of data collection, allowing
for the visualization of results on the cortical surface.</p>
        <p id="P27">To identify parcels in which ISC was most positively/negatively
associated with RSFC across the brain, the inbound and outbound maps were Fisher
<italic toggle="yes">z</italic>-transformed, averaged, and converted back to units of
Spearman’s <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>. Next, these inbound/outbound
averages were grouped by resting state network (RSN) membership according to the
Cole-Anticevic Brain-wide Network Partition (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Ji
et al., 2019</xref>) to facilitate visualization of network-level trends.
Finally, mean outbound values from both days were Spearman-correlated with
rankings along a sensorimotor-association axis, where low ranks correspond to
low-level sensory regions (e.g., V1, A1) and high ranks correspond to high-level
association areas (e.g., dmPFC, PCC; developed by <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Sydnor et al. (2021)</xref> and downloaded from <ext-link xlink:href="https://pennlinc.github.io/S-A_ArchetypalAxis/" ext-link-type="uri">https://pennlinc.github.io/S-A_ArchetypalAxis/</ext-link>). Only left
hemisphere parcels were used for this analysis, as the sensorimotor-hierarchy
ranking created by Sydnor et al., did not include the Glasser
parcellation’s right hemisphere.</p>
        <p id="P28">Because the number of parcels belonging to each Cole-Anticevic RSN is an
arbitrary value based on the resolution of the Glasser parcellation, we used
bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) to test whether the averages of the mean
inbound and outbound maps within RSN were significantly different from zero.
Non-parametric bootstrap CIs were constructed by randomly sampling 176 subjects
with replacement, repeating the inbound and outbound analyses, and recalculating
the RSN averages 1000 times. To account for multiple comparisons across the
twelve RSNs, 95% CIs were Bonferroni corrected using the formula 1 –
(alpha/number of RSNs), leading to an effective CI of 99.6% for each RSN average
on each day.</p>
        <p id="P29">The inbound analysis introduced earlier in this section addresses how
connectivity from parcel A to parcels B-Z is associated with ISC in parcel A.
Although this analysis neatly parallels the dimensionality of the outbound
analysis, it ignores how resting state functional connections that don’t
involve parcel A (i.e., connectivity <italic toggle="yes">between</italic> parcels B-Z) might
be associated with ISC in that parcel. To address this limitation, we used a
“full” inbound analysis that correlates all edges of the RSFC
matrix with ISC in the reference parcel.</p>

        <title>Spatial permutation tests</title>
        <p id="P30">Similarity between the Day 1 and Day 2 inbound/outbound maps was
quantified using Spearman correlation. Because (1) the number of samples in
these correlations is determined by parcellation resolution and (2) spatial
autocorrelation is present among adjacent parcels, a spatial permutation test
was used to assess the significance of these correlations (and all other spatial
correlations performed here) following the method and code of <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Váša et al. (2018)</xref>. Briefly, this test
works by inflating one of the spatial maps from each correlation to a sphere,
randomly rotating this projection, and calculating the Spearman correlation
between the empirical map and the randomly rotated projection. This procedure is
repeated until a desired number (here, 10,000) of permutations have been
performed, and the final permutation <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value reflects the
number of null permutations for which the resulting Spearman correlation is
greater than the observed correlation divided by the total number of
permutations. Although recent work has identified that this approach relies upon
often unrealistic statistical assumptions (<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Weinstein et al., 2021</xref>), we note that no alternative method is
compatible with our effect maps which are undefined at the individual subject
level. As such, the present spin method can be seen as the best available
significance test for the day-to-day consistency of our observed effects.</p>

        <title>RSFC and ISC topological similarity</title>
        <p id="P32">One pairwise RSFC similarity matrix was generated for each day of data
collection by (Spearman) correlating RSFC profiles (i.e., each subject’s
set of 64,620 unique FC edge strengths) from all possible pairs of subjects,
leaving two 176 subjects x 176 subjects matrices in which higher values
correspond to greater RSFC profile similarity for those two individuals. The
same procedure was repeated using each subject’s ISC topologies, again
yielding two 176 subjects x 176 subjects matrices. Here, we noted that four
subjects, two different subjects on each day, had markedly different ISC
topologies from the rest of the sample. These individuals also had the lowest
gISC values for their respective movie scans, suggesting minimal engagement with
the stimulus. Data from these outlier scans were discarded from the rest of the
analyses described in this section for a sample size of 174 subjects, although
we note that including these subjects does not change the interpretation of our
results. These subjects were not excluded from the previous analyses as they
were not identified as outliers in the Figs. 2D and 3 scatter plots.</p>
        <p id="P33">Pairwise motion, tSNR, and gISC similarity matrices were also generated
by calculating the negative absolute value of the difference between every pair
of subjects’ mean framewise displacement for each day’s rest and
movie scans as well as their (Fisher <italic toggle="yes">z</italic>-transformed) gISC
values. Finally, a Spearman partial correlation was performed between each
day’s RSFC and ISC similarity matrices, controlling for pairwise
similarity in motion, tSNR, and gISC. A permutation test was used to evaluate
the significance of the RSFC-ISC topological similarity relationships.
Specifically, the subject-level ISC, gISC, and movie watching FD and tSNR
matrices were shuffled using the same randomly generated order across subjects
and pairwise ISC/gISC/tSNR/FD similarities were recalculated. The Spearman
partial correlation described above was then performed using the shuffled movie
vectors and the original resting state vectors such that each pair’s mean
movie watching FD and tSNR, gISC, and ISC pattern similarity values were
associated with the mean resting state FD and tSNR and RSFC pattern similarity
values from a random pair. This process was repeated 10,000 times to generate
the null distributions shown in Fig. 6B.</p>

        <title>Functional connectivity at rest predicts a global measure of normative
movie-evoked activity</title>
        <p id="P35">Ridge connectome-based predictive modeling (rCPM) was used to predict
each participant’s average ISC across all parcels (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This cortex-wide measure, which we refer to
as global ISC (gISC), serves as a low-dimensional marker of brain
synchronization, or how similar an individual’s temporal patterns of
neural activity during movie watching are to the rest of the group’s. We
used rCPM to ask two related questions: to what extent can a model trained on
data from one set of subjects watching one set of movie clips predict gISC in
(1) a different set of subjects watching the same clips, and (2) the same
subjects watching a different set of clips.</p>
        <p id="P36">Using only the Day 1 rest and movie data, we performed 100 iterations of
rCPM with split-half cross-validation (CV) to predict gISC from RSFC in unseen
subjects. Parcel-level ISC (averaged across individuals; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and
individual-level gISC (averaged across parcels; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) were consistent across
the two days, as reflected by Spearman correlations of <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>
= 0.97 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sub>spin</sub> &lt; 1 ×
10<sup>−4</sup> ) and <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.68
(<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 2.2 × 10<sup>−24</sup> ) respectively.
We note that the <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.68 test-retest reliability value
serves as a sort of upper bound on prediction performance as it represents how
well gISC can predict itself across the different stimuli. Because the
reliability of gISC was calculated while controlling for tSNR and head motion
(quantified by mean framewise displacement; mean FD) from both movie scans, rank
residuals were used to create the scatterplots shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and elsewhere in
the paper when appropriate (although plots showing raw values can be found in
<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig.
S1</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P37">The bagged model was able to predict Day 2 gISC from Day 2 RSFC with
significant accuracy (<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.51, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 1.4
× 10<sup>−12</sup>; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>)
indicating that an individual’s ability to exhibit normative
stimulus-evoked activity is closely related to their brain’s intrinsic
functional architecture. To visualize the functional distribution of RSFC edges
that contributed to the model’s predictive performance, we averaged
positive and negative edges separately according to resting state network (RSN)
membership as defined by the Cole-Anticevic Brain-wide Network Partition (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). Predictive edges were
widely distributed across RSNs according to no obvious pattern, although
positive relationships between RSFC and gISC were more pronounced than negative
relationships (as seen in the scales of <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs.
2D</xref>–<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P38">Importantly, individual differences in RSFC are known to depend on
factors that could complicate the interpretation of our results, including head
motion, parcellation selection (Bryce et al., 2021), and individual differences
in areal topologies (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Gratton et al.,
2018</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>). To
control for head motion more conservatively, we assigned subjects to a low or
high motion group based on a median split over mean FD and repeated this CPM
analysis in both groups independently, finding that Day 2 gISC could be
predicted in both groups (low motion <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.55,
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 8 × 10<sup>−8</sup>; high motion
<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.53, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 1.7 ×
10<sup>−7</sup> ; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). RSFC could also be used to predict Day 2
gISC when controlling for individual differences in global intrasubject
correlation, a potential measure of data quality (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Finally, we
repeated the rCPM analysis using individualized versions of the Schaefer 400
parcellation, again finding that Day 2 gISC could be predicted from RSFC (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig.

        <p id="P39">To examine how models trained on data from one group of subjects can

accuracies (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, gray dots) generated

        <title>Inbound and outbound analyses characterize region-specific RSFC-ISC
relationships</title>
        <p id="P40">In the previous section, we demonstrated that an individual’s
RSFC profile is predictive of their cortex-wide ISC during movie watching. Next,
to investigate region-specific RSFC-ISC relationships, we introduce the related
“inbound” and “outbound” analyses. The inbound
analysis, demonstrated in Fig. 3A using Day 1 data, describes how ISC in a given
parcel is associated with that parcel’s resting connectivity to every
other parcel (raw values are shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). The
intuition behind and results of this analysis are first exemplified using the
left frontal eye field (FEF), a parcel chosen for its circumscribed role in the
well-studied saccade pathway (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Felleman and Van
Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Paus, 1996</xref>). To
create the brain maps shown in the top row of Fig. 3A, left FEF ISC was
correlated with RSFC between left FEF and the other 359 cortical parcels while
controlling for head motion and tSNR from the corresponding rest and movie
scans. This analysis revealed that individuals whose left FEF was more connected
to visual and parietal areas at rest exhibited more typical FEF activity during
movie watching, consistent with the FEF’s known inputs from visual and
parietal cortex (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Felleman and Van Essen,
1991</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Paus, 1996</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P41">Having demonstrated that the inbound analysis reveals expected RSFC-ISC
relationships in a relatively unimodal and well-studied area, we next sought to
apply the same analysis to a parcel in the temporo-parieto-occipital junction
(TPOJ2), a multimodal area in the temporoparietal junction/posterior superior
temporal sulcus region whose functioning is less understood but has been
implicated in sensory integration during narrative processing (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Lerner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2019</xref>). Reflecting TPOJ2’s multimodal function,
greater ISC in this parcel was associated with increased connectivity to
unimodal sensory (e.g., visual, auditory, somatomotor) cortices and decreased
connectivity to higher order areas (e.g., angular gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex; dlPFC) at rest (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, lower
row). Although only Day 1 results are visualized in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, Spearman spatial correlations confirmed that
the inbound maps for both left FEF and TPOJ2 were consistent across both days of
data collection (spatial <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.90,
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">spin</italic></sub> &lt; 1 ×
10<sup>−4</sup> and spatial <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.98,
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">spin</italic></sub> &lt; 1 ×
10<sup>−4</sup> respectively).</p>
        <p id="P42">While the inbound analysis describes how a brain region’s
functioning (ISC) is related to its intrinsic connectivity (RSFC) to other
regions, a distinct but similarly informative relationship is how a
region’s RSFC to other areas is associated with ISC in those areas. To
quantify this “outbound” relationship, we calculated the Spearman
partial correlation between the RSFC edge strengths for all connections
involving a given parcel and ISC in every other parcel. The FEF outbound map
therefore illustrates that greater RSFC between FEF and dlPFC is associated with
greater ISC in dlPFC (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), again
replicating known hierarchical relationships between these two areas (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Arkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Corbetta et al., 2008</xref>). The TPOJ2 outbound map shows
a diffuse pattern that is notably attenuated in somatosensory, auditory, and
visual regions compared to the corresponding inbound map, illustrating that RSFC
between sensory regions and TPOJ2 is more relevant to TPOJ2 ISC than to sensory
cortex ISC. Both the FEF and TPOJ2 outbound maps were consistent across the
different days of data collection (spatial <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.84,

        <title>Network-level inbound/outbound relationships and means</title>
        <p id="P43">The human cortex is organized into large-scale networks that sub-serve
different sensory and cognitive functions during movie-watching. To characterize
how movie-evoked activity in these networks is associated with intra- and
inter-network RSFC, we averaged inbound and outbound values according to network
membership to create the heatmaps shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>. Greater intra-network RSFC
was consistently associated with greater ISC, as indicated by the red diagonals
of both heatmaps. On the other hand, inter-network RSFC showed more variable
relationships with ISC, but these relationships tended to be consistently
positive or negative within networks and inbound/outbound analyses. For example,
sensory networks like visual 2, somatosensory, and auditory networks tended to
exhibit more positive outbound relationships with other networks. Meanwhile, the
posterior and ventral multimodal networks (PMN/VMN) exhibited positive inbound
relationships with all networks except the frontoparietal and default mode
networks (FPN/DMN), indicating that these areas encode more stimulus-related
information when they are more broadly connected to sensory areas at rest.</p>
        <p id="P44">Classical theories of sensory information processing place cortical
areas on a spectrum ranging from specialized to integrative (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Mesulam, 1998</xref>). To identify integrative hubs whose

intrinsic connectivity to the rest of the brain, we visualized the average of

affiliation to illustrate network-level trends (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). At the network level, the PMN and VMN displayed the

positive and negative values together can potentially obscure interesting
effects, we have included mean inbound/outbound values using of positive- and
negative-only values in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P46">Although the Day 1 auditory and Day 2 DMN CIs contained zero, this
overall pattern of results indicates that for the average parcel, greater
connectivity at rest to unimodal sensory areas (i.e., auditory and visual
networks) was most associated with greater ISC during movie watching, while the
opposite was true regarding greater connectivity to higher-order networks (i.e.,
FPN and DMN). This suggests that a parcel’s mean outbound value reflects
its position along a sensory-to-cognitive gradient. To test this hypothesis
explicitly, we correlated outbound scores for each parcel with
sensorimotor-association hierarchy rankings from (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Sydnor et al., 2021</xref>). We found strong negative
relationships between these two variables on both days (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>; Day 1 spatial <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> =

sensorimotor parcels at rest is associated with greater ISC during
movie-watching (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Finally, to
determine the sensitivity of the mean inbound/outbound topologies identified
here to parcellation choice, we generated the mean inbound/outbound maps using
the Schaefer 400 individualized parcellations and found qualitatively similar
maps (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig.

        <title>Principal component analysis reveals low-dimensional embedding of inbound and
outbound maps</title>
        <p id="P47">Although the network-level analysis shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> serves as a convenient way to reduce the
dimensionality of the inbound and outbound maps, it is unable to reveal
connectivity-activity relationships that cut across network boundaries. To
explore the underlying structure of the 360 inbound and outbound maps without
making a priori assumptions about network organization, we used principal
component analysis (PCA), a dimension reduction technique that preserves more of
the information in the original feature space than the averaging shown in <xref rid="S21" ref-type="sec">Section 3.3</xref>. PCA of the outbound maps
revealed that two PCs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) were
sufficient to account for a majority of the outbound map variance on both days,
describing ~30% and ~20% of variance, respectively (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Here, parcels with higher (redder) scores in
the upper rows have outbound maps that look like the PCs shown in the lower
rows. Relatedly, given the complementary nature of the outbound and inbound
matrices, parcels with stronger loadings on these PCs have inbound maps that
look more like the cortical maps shown in the upper rows.</p>
        <p id="P48">The first PC was most positively expressed in visual, cingulo-opercular,
and dorsal attention parcels, and was negatively expressed in DMN parcels. This
PC loaded most strongly onto left TPOJ, but DMN parcels loaded either negatively
or only weakly positively on this component. In other words, DMN parcels
exhibited greater ISC when they were more connected to other DMN (and less
connected to visual) parcels in this PC. The second PC, most positively
represented in the superior temporal sulci (STS) and somatomotor cortices and
negatively represented in FPN parcels, loaded most heavily onto left dlPFC.
Although TPOJ and dlPFC had among the highest average inbound values in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, the former’s loading onto PC1
and the latter’s loading onto PC2 suggests that greater ISC in these two
integrative areas is most associated with connectivity to separate sets of
regions. This difference is especially apparent when considering connectivity to
STS, which was positively associated with dlPFC ISC (in PC2) but negatively
associated with ISC in TPOJ (in PC1). Similarly, although DMN and FPN parcels
both had similarly low outbound values (shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>/C), their differential expression in PC 1 vs. PC2 suggests
heterogeneous connectivity-activity relationships between these sets of parcels
and the rest of the brain.</p>
        <p id="P49">While the inbound analysis introduced in <xref rid="S20" ref-type="sec">Section 3.2</xref> neatly parallels the dimensionality of the outbound
analysis, it only captures how ISC in parcel A is associated with its RSFC
<italic toggle="yes">to</italic> parcels B-Z, ignoring RSFC <italic toggle="yes">between</italic>
parcels B-Z. To fill this gap, results from a version of the inbound PCA that
relates RSFC across all edges with ISC are visualized in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>, which shows
that ISC in different functional systems is most associated with notably
different full RSFC patterns.</p>

        <title>Subjects with more similar RSFC fingerprints share more similar spatial
patterns of ISC</title>
        <p id="P50">Our analyses thus far have focused on relationships between the
magnitudes of RSFC and ISC across participants. However, the spatial pattern of
ISC across a person’s brain likely reflects additional
individual-specific aspects of brain function. An emphasis on topological
patterns is apparent in functional connectome fingerprinting studies, which have
shown that individuals can be identified by their unique set of (relative) RSFC
edge strengths (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Finn et al., 2015</xref>).
However, the relevance of these whole-brain RSFC profiles to spatial patterns of
ISC is still unclear.</p>
        <p id="P51">To investigate whether RSFC profiles are related to how ISC, independent
of its overall magnitude, is distributed across the brain, we used a pairwise
similarity analysis to determine if individuals with more similar functional
connectomes also shared more similar spatial patterns of ISC. First, we
correlated RSFC and ISC profiles separately across participants to generate the
similarity matrices shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>. As expected, patterns of RSFC and ISC were
largely conserved across participants (Day 1/Day 2 RSFC mean pairwise similarity
<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.52/0.53, std. = 0.015/0.012; ISC mean pairwise
similarity <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.74/0.74, std. = 0.017/0.021). On each
day, the ISC topologies for two individuals were markedly different compared to
the rest of the sample (seen as dark stripes in the ISC similarity heatmaps in
6A, different individuals on each day), so these four outlier movie scans were
discarded from the following analysis. Next, we correlated the pairwise ISC and
RSFC similarity values, controlling for similarity in gISC, and rest and movie
scan head motion and tSNR. Across both days, we found that participant pairs
with more similar RSFC profiles also shared more similar spatial patterns of ISC
(Day 1 <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.16, permutation <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 1.0
× 10<sup>−3</sup>; Day 2 <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.18,

upper row; raw values shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). Null distributions generated to test this
relationship are shown in Fig. 6B (lower row) and illustrate that the
topological similarity relationships are significantly stronger than would be
expected by chance. Because individual differences in areal topologies could
complicate the interpretation of this result, we repeated this analysis using
the individualized Schaefer 400 parcellations, again finding very similar
effects (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P52">Here, we extend research into the neural processing of naturalistic stimuli
by showing that an individual’s brain connectivity at rest is associated with
their degree and distribution of normative movie-evoked brain activity. First, we
demonstrated that distributed networks of RSFC edges can be used to predict global
ISC across subjects and scanning sessions. Next, we explored regional RSFC-ISC
relationships, finding that greater ISC in multimodal parcels is related to higher
RSFC to unimodal sensory cortex and lower RSFC to frontoparietal and default mode
networks. Finally, we showed that individuals with more similar RSFC fingerprints
share more similar spatial patterns of ISC. Taken together, these results reveal new
relationships between intrinsic brain connectivity and task-driven function while
opening up additional lines of inquiry for the study of idiosyncratic responses to
naturalistic stimuli.</p>
      <p id="P53">Individual differences in ISC magnitude have previously been associated with
behavioral traits such as top-down attentional control (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2015</xref>). Building upon this literature, we
used rCPM to identify a network of RSFC edges (i.e., the 1437 RSFC edges included in
the bagged model) whose combined strengths accounted for a sizable proportion of
between-subject variance in a global measure of ISC. Extending the work of Campbell
and colleagues, this RSFC network could reflect a general signature of attentional
ability, similar to networks identified by (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg et
al., 2020</xref>). In this case, individuals who express this RSFC profile more
so than others would be expected to attend more to movie clips, leading to increased
levels of ISC. At the parcel level, we would expect ISC in different parcels to be
associated with the same 1437 RSFC edges that comprise the predictive network, as
greater attention to the movie clips should lead to distributed increases in ISC
(<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Ki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Regev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Song
et al., 2021</xref>). Instead, in our full inbound analysis, we observed that
relationships between parcel-level ISC and whole-brain RSFC patterns differed
considerably across parcels. Specifically, 10+ principal components were needed to
account for a majority of the full inbound matrix variance shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S9</xref>. Given this result, the RSFC
network might instead be more representative of the functional architecture of
bottom-up information transfer, independent of top-down influences. Future studies
that simultaneously evaluate relationships between RSFC, ISC, and behavioral traits
like attentional control will provide valuable insight into the cognitive
implications of the present findings.</p>
      <p id="P54">In addition to identifying RSFC edges that predict global ISC, we also
characterized region-specific RSFC-ISC relationships through our inbound and
outbound analyses. First, our inbound analysis showed that the resting state
connections most associated with ISC in a given parcel are not simply a function of
its network affiliation. For example, although the FEF parcel studied here was shown
to be more connected to cingulo-opercular areas than to visual cortex at rest (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2019</xref>), our inbound analysis showed
that typical activity in this parcel during movie-watching was more strongly
associated with its connectivity to visual and dorsal attention networks rather than
cingulo-opercular cortex. Furthermore, although RSFC derived from bivariate
correlation is inherently undirected, comparing the inbound and outbound maps for a
given parcel allows for the generation of directional hypotheses. That visual-FEF
connectivity is more associated with FEF ISC than visual cortex ISC suggests that,
consistent with established models of the visual processing hierarchy (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>), stimulus-related
information is more likely to flow from visual cortex to FEF. This expected finding,
as well as the stability of these results across different rest and movie scans,
motivates the use of inbound/outbound analyses to investigate how connectivity
relates to function in more arcane regions and functional systems, as we
demonstrated with the TPOJ.</p>
      <p id="P55">After showing how the inbound and outbound analyses reveal stable RSFC-ISC
relationships in specific regions, we next investigated network-level trends in
these relationships. By averaging across the inbound maps, we found that parcels in
the ventral and posterior multi-modal networks (located in temporoparietal cortex)
exhibited the highest average inbound map values. In other words, activity in these
parcels was more typical when they were more positively connected to the rest of the
brain. This finding is consistent with previous work showing that these posterior
multimodal regions consolidate audiovisual information (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Baldassano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Lerner et al.,
2011</xref>) and suggests that the integrative function of these regions is
related to their distributed intrinsic connectivity. Complementing this result, we
found that parcels in visual and auditory networks exhibited some of the greatest
average outbound values, indicating that greater connectivity to these areas at rest
was associated with greater ISC. This likely reflects the fact that auditory and
visual areas are among the most synchronized during movie-watching and can be
thought of as sources of stimulus-driven signal. Alternatively, connectivity to
frontoparietal and default mode parcels, which tend to be among the least
synchronized by movies, was on average inversely related to ISC. Subsequent PCA of
the outbound maps clarified this result by showing that connectivity to default mode
parcels was negatively associated with TPOJ ISC but positively associated with ISC
in default mode parcels themselves. That these parcels exhibited more typical
activity when they were more connected to functionally similar (and less connected
to dissimilar) areas at rest is consistent with the idea that more modular cortical
organization is associated with more efficient information flow (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Wig, 2017</xref>). Lastly, the loading of left dlPFC and TPOJ
onto different PCs indicates that ISC in both areas is closely related to their RSFC
to different sets of parcels, suggesting that these areas may play important but
distinct roles in the processing of naturalistic stimuli.</p>
      <p id="P56">Beyond informing theories of cortical information processing, our results
have implications for the understanding of circumscribed ISC deficits reported in
patient populations. Our inbound/outbound findings provide evidence for the
hypothesis that low ISC in a particular area may be driven by pathological
alterations in inter-regional connectivity rather than dysfunction in the region
itself. Future work outlining the causal direction of these RSFC-ISC relationships
will inform the clinical applications of naturalistic fMRI (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Eickhoff et al., 2020</xref>), as whether atypical activity in a
region is self-limited or a consequence of its connectivity to other areas is an
important consideration in developing targeted therapies (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P57">Although naturalistic imaging studies have tended to focus on individual
differences in the magnitude of ISC, it is important to note that this measure is
susceptible to session effects that may obscure meaningful trait-related variance.
For example, an attentive subject scanned at the end of a long day may exhibit less
ISC than a more distractible individual scanned when they are most alert. The low
test-retest reliability of activation magnitudes is a general issue in task fMRI
research (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Elliott et al., 2020</xref>). However, by
asking “where” task activations occur instead of “how
much” activation is present, researchers have been able to more reliably
elicit individual differences and excise state-dependent noise from their analyses
(Kragel et al., 2021). Moreover, individuals’ activation maps derived from
modeled responses to difficult tasks have been accurately predicted from their RSFC
profiles, suggesting that unique spatial activation patterns are intimately related
to variation in the brain’s intrinsic wiring (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Tavor et al.,
2016</xref>). Extending this line of work to model-free naturalistic paradigms,
we found that subjects with more similar resting state connectomes shared more
similar spatial patterns of ISC during movie watching, independent of their
similarity in ISC magnitude. This finding indicates that spatial distributions of
ISC capture subject-specific information that ISC magnitudes alone do not, echoing
recent reports that have established multivariate patterns as superior detectors of
individual differences (Kragel et al., 2021).</p>
      <p id="P58">Several limitations of this study constrain the interpretation and
generalizability of our results. First, the short (3–5 min) clips used here
may have failed to adequately engage cortical areas with longer temporal receptive
windows (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Baldassano et al., 2017</xref>). Future
studies that utilize continuous stimuli may be better able to characterize RSFC-ISC
relationships in these areas. Second, functional brain topologies have been shown to
differ meaningfully across individuals and task states (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Gratton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Salehi et al., 2020</xref>). Subjects identified as having lower RSFC and/or
ISC in our analyses may instead have functional topologies that are less represented
by the Glasser parcellation, complicating the interpretation of our inbound/outbound
results. Our use of Spearman partial correlations to link RSFC and ISC presents its
own set of limitations. Some RSFC-ISC relationships may be non-monotonic, such that
both hypo- and hyper-connectivity between a pair of regions is associated with lower
ISC. The correlation method used here also prevents us from assessing the unique
contribution of single RSFC edges to parcel-level ISC, as would be possible with
multiple regression. Finally, although we controlled for motion and tSNR while
performing our correlations, other imaging artifacts and/or non-monotonic effects
could still have contributed to our RSFC-ISC relationships.</p>
      <p id="P59">Despite these limitations, this study constitutes an important step towards
characterizing the complex relationships between normative stimulus-evoked activity
and the brain’s intrinsic functional architecture. By linking resting state
connectivity with task-driven function at the parcel, network, and cortex-wide
levels, these findings further develop our understanding of sensory information
processing and anchor individual differences in ISC in the resting state connectome.
Additional research into these connectivity-activity relationships will be
instrumental in exploring the cognitive and perceptual relevance of resting state
fMRI and contextualizing new discoveries from the growing field of naturalistic
imaging.</p>

consider choosing references that reflect the diversity of the field in thought,
form of contribution, gender, race, ethnicity, and other factors. First, we obtained

man/man. This method is limited in that a) names, pronouns, and social media
profiles used to construct the databases may not, in every case, be indicative of
gender identity and b) it cannot account for intersex, non-binary, or transgender
people. Second, we obtained predicted racial/ethnic categories of the first and last

to make the predictions may not be indicative of racial/ethnic identity, and b) it
cannot account for Indigenous and mixed-race authors, or those who may face
differential biases due to the ambiguous racialization or ethnicization of their

support equitable practices in science.</p>

        <p id="P65">Ridge CPM pipeline. (A) Predicting gISC from RSFC in held-out subjects:
RSFC matrices were created by (Pearson) correlating activity time courses from
all pairs of parcels for each individual and day of data collection. Subjects
were divided into two commensurate groups, and ISC values for every parcel were
calculated for each subject as the Pearson correlations between their activity
time course in a given parcel and that of the group average. These 360
parcel-wise values were averaged to yield 1 gISC value per subject per day of
data collection. A model was then trained to predict gISC values from RSFC data
in one group and tested on data from the held-out group, with model performance
being evaluated as the Spearman partial correlation between predicted and actual
Day 1 gISC values, controlling for head motion and tSNR. This procedure was
repeated 99 more times using different train/test group splits, yielding 200
linear models and 100 correlation coefficients reflecting prediction accuracies.
(B) Predicting gISC from RSFC in held-out stimuli: The 200 linear models were
aggregated into one composite model which was tested on Day 2 gISC and RSFC data
from all 176 subjects. Once again, model accuracy was evaluated using the
Spearman partial correlation between predicted and actual Day 2 gISC values,
controlling for Day 2 head motion and tSNR.</p>

subjects. (A) ISC analysis reveals a non-uniform cortical distribution of shared
stimulus-evoked activity that is consistent across Day 1 and Day 2 stimuli. (B)
Individual differences in gISC were consistent across the Day 1 and Day 2 scans.
In this and subsequent scatter plots, each dot represents an individual subject
unless noted otherwise. As these plots represent Spearman partial correlations
(controlling for head motion and tSNR), the x- and y-axes are in units of rank
residuals so that the slope of the best fit line represents the corresponding
Spearman correlation coefficient. (C) A bagged rCPM model trained on Day 1 data
predicts Day 2 gISC from RSFC with considerable accuracy. (D-E) Heatmaps
illustrating that the bagged rCPM model’s negative and positive features
were broadly distributed across functional networks. (F) Models trained on Day 1
data from one set of subjects predict Day 1 gISC in held-out subjects at
above-chance accuracy. Red dots represent prediction accuracies from the actual
100 CV iterations, whereas gray dots reflect null prediction accuracies from
re-running the rCPM analysis using permuted gISC and movie FD values 10,000
times.</p>

reference parcel (yellow) and some other parcel (red) is associated with ISC in
the reference parcel. Greater resting connectivity from FEF (or TPOJ2) to
red-shaded parcels is associated with greater FEF (or TPOJ2) ISC during movie
watching. Example inbound maps are shown for parcels covering left FEF (top row)
and TPOJ2 (bottom row). Corresponding scatter plots illustrate how the inbound
correlation coefficients for the bordered parcels are calculated. (B) Outbound
analysis: This analysis describes how RSFC between the reference parcel (yellow)
and some other parcel (red) is associated with ISC in the other parcel. Greater
RSFC from FEF (or TPOJ2) to red-shaded parcels is associated with greater ISC in
those parcels during movie watching. Corresponding scatter plots illustrate how
the outbound correlation coefficients for the bordered parcels were
calculated.</p>

illustrate inbound (shown in columns) and outbound (shown in rows) relationships
averaged within functional networks. (B) Each parcel’s values on these
surfaces reflect the average of the 359 values comprising its inbound map (e.g.,
the surfaces in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) on each day. (C)
Same as B for the outbound maps. (D) Boxplots group the parcels from the
surfaces in (B) according to their network affiliation, such that the
y-coordinates in these plots are the same as the values on the above surfaces.
The left and right boxes for each network reflect Day 1 and Day 2 results,
respectively. The posterior and ventral multimodal networks had mean inbound
values that were significantly greater than zero on both days.
Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals for all other networks contained zero
on one or both days. (E) Same as D for the outbound analysis; only visual 2 and
frontoparietal networks had average outbound values that were significantly
different from zero on both days. (F) Relationships between mean outbound values
and sensorimotor-association hierarchy ranks for all left hemisphere parcels
(Day 1 on left, Day 2 on right). Because Spearman correlations were used for
this analysis, the least-squares lines visualized here do not directly
correspond to the accompanying correlation coefficients.</p>

display the scores and loadings for the first two principal components (PCs) of
the outbound maps. Parcels in the lower row of surfaces that appear redder have
inbound maps that look more like the surfaces in the upper row. Due to the
symmetry of the inbound/outbound maps, redder parcels in the upper row of
surfaces have outbound maps that look more like the surfaces in the lower row.
(B) Scree plots show that the majority of outbound map variance can be accounted
for by two PCs, with the percentage of variance explained tapering off after the
third PC on both days.</p>

        <p id="P70">Individuals with more similar resting state connectomes have more
similar spatial distributions of ISC. (A) Heatmaps show that RSFC and ISC
profiles are generally conserved across individuals. (B) Scatterplots show the
positive relationships between RSFC and ISC profile similarity, where each dot
reflects one unique pair of subjects. To preserve visual clarity, the x- and
y-axes reflect unranked ISC/RSFC similarity values after partialling out the
effects of head motion, tSNR, and gISC similarity. The null distributions in the
lower row visualize the results of matching one pair’s RSFC similarity
with the ISC similarity of a random pair and repeating the Spearman partial
correlation 10,000 times. Plotting the strength of the true RSFC/ISC profile
similarity correlation coefficients on these distributions reveals that the
observed effects are much stronger than would be expected by chance. We note
that because unranked values were graphed on the scatterplots, the slopes of the
best fit lines only indirectly correspond to the vertical lines on the null
distributions.</p>
