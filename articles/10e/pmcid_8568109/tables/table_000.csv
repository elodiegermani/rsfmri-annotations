Parameter,Calculation procedure/ meaning
R1,Voxel-level fMRI measures during the first (pre-task) resting-state (RS) (baseline)
R2,Voxel-level fMRI measures during the second (post-task) RS.
"T1, T2, T3",Voxel-level fMRI measures during the three subtasks of the visual oddball paradigm.
RS difference (RSD),Difference between post- and pre-task RS (R2—R1) in the voxel-level fMRI measures for each subject.
Task(whole),Task (whole) = (T1 + T2 +T3) / 3 (mean values of the fMRI measures during the three subtasks)
Main task(whole),Task (whole)—R1
RS similarity (RSS),Correlation coefficient between R1 and R2 for each subject.
Task effect at the group level,Correlation coefficients between the differences (Task (whole)–R1) and (R2—R1). All correlation coefficients were computed using Pearson’s correlation coefficients at a significance level of p < 0.05.
