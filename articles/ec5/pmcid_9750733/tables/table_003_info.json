All comparisons are based on data from which the effects of age and cohort have been removed by regression. The test statistic is the L1-norm of component differences. Within AD cohort differences are relative to controls. Between cohort differences are as labeled. Significance was estimated by comparison of the true test statistic against the distribution of nulls obtained by 100,000-fold permutation resampling. The listed p-values are not corrected for multiple comparisons. p-values < 0.05 are highlighted.", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_003.csv"}
