        <p id="Par1">While shaped and constrained by axonal connections, fMRI-based functional connectivity reorganizes in response to varying interareal input or pathological perturbations. However, the causal contribution of regional brain activity to whole-brain fMRI network organization remains unclear. Here we combine neural manipulations, resting-state fMRI and in vivo electrophysiology to probe how inactivation of a cortical node causally affects brain-wide fMRI coupling in the mouse. We find that chronic inhibition of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) via overexpression of a potassium channel increases fMRI connectivity between the inhibited area and its direct thalamo-cortical targets. Acute chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC produces analogous patterns of fMRI overconnectivity. Using in vivo electrophysiology, we find that chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC enhances low frequency (0.1–4 Hz) oscillatory power via suppression of neural firing not phase-locked to slow rhythms, resulting in increased slow and δ band coherence between areas that exhibit fMRI overconnectivity. These results provide causal evidence that cortical inactivation can counterintuitively increase fMRI connectivity via enhanced, less-localized slow oscillatory processes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">A rapidly expanding approach to understand the functional organization of brain networks is to map large-scale patterns of spontaneous activity via non-invasive neuroimaging. The ease and reproducibility of “resting state” fMRI (rsfMRI) have promoted the widespread use of this approach, leading to the observation that spontaneous fMRI activity is organized into highly coherent functional networks, defined by temporally correlated fluctuations in BOLD signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The non-invasive nature of rsfMRI has fueled the use of this method to map intrinsic brain network organization in the healthy human brain, as well as in psychiatric or neurological conditions, in which evidence of disrupted or aberrant rsfMRI functional coupling has been largely documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, despite the growing popularity of rsfMRI, our knowledge of the underpinnings of brain-wide fMRI coupling remains very limited.</p>
      <p id="Par4">Multiple lines of evidence suggest that structural and rsfMRI-based connectivity are robustly related<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. First, structural and functional connection strengths are correlated both at the whole-brain and mesoscopic scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and rsfMRI network topography closely recapitulates patterns of anatomical connectivity in several mammalian species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Second, experimental resection of callosal connections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> or chemogenetic inactivation of the amygdala results in reduced rsfMRI connectivity with regions anatomically linked to the manipulated area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Lastly, computational modeling corroborates a tight relationship between structural and functional connectivity, as synchronous rsfMRI fluctuations can be modeled by dynamical systems endowed with realistic anatomical connectivity patterns of long-range axonal interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Accordingly, simulated axonal lesions in these models result in reduced functional coupling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par5">These observations have prompted the widespread use of statistical dependencies in spontaneous fMRI signal as an index of interareal functional communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, the neural mechanisms linking regional brain activity to large-scale rsfMRI network connectivity remain unclear. For example, growing experimental evidence suggests that, while tightly constrained by underlying anatomy, rsfMRI connectivity may only partially reflect direct interactions between areas, as widespread BOLD signal modulation might arise via subcortical connections, whether through the thalamus via long-range loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, or as a result of diffuse neuromodulation mediated by brainstem nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This notion is epitomized by the observation of intact rsfMRI coupling among brain regions not directly structurally connected as in the case of acallosal humans, primates, and rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, rsfMRI network topography can dynamically reconfigure in response to local perturbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or pathological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In keeping with this, neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and Alzheimer’s disease have been often found to be associated with unexpectedly increased interareal rsfMRI connectivity despite the loss of cortical function characterizing these conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Taken together, these observations point at a complex relationship between interareal brain activity and rsfMRI coupling, and call for a deeper investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying the reconfiguration of rsfMRI connectivity in response to varying interareal input or pathological perturbations.</p>
      <p id="Par6">Here we combine rsfMRI, neural and chemogenetic inhibition (chemo-fMRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>), and in vivo electrophysiology in the mouse to probe how inactivation of a cortical area causally affects rsfMRI coupling. Surprisingly, we find that chronic and acute inhibition of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), a core component of the mouse default mode network DMN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, can increase rsfMRI coupling with its thalamo-cortical targets. This effect is associated with decreased ϒ power in the suppressed region and robustly increased low frequency (0.1–4 Hz) electrophysiological coherence between functionally overconnected PFC targets. These findings reveal a highly dynamic, non-monotonic relationship between regional cortical activity and network-wide rsfMRI connectivity, and provide an interpretative framework for the observation of counterintuitively increased rsfMRI connectivity in pathological conditions characterized by impaired cortical function.</p>

        <title>rsfMRI overconnectivity upon chronic inactivation of the mouse prefrontal cortex</title>
        <p id="Par7">The robust structural foundations of rsfMRI connectivity suggest that neural inhibition of a network node would result in diminished functional coupling with regions receiving direct axonal projections from the inactivated region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. To test this prediction and more broadly investigate how rsfMRI dynamically reconfigures in response to local neural suppression, we carried out rsfMRI measurements in a cohort of mice in which neuronal activity in PFC was chronically inhibited via bilateral viral transduction of the inward rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Our interest in the PFC was motivated by its translational relevance as a key component of the mouse default mode network (DMN), a major phylogenetically conserved rsfMRI network that in rodents is composed of three hubs, namely the PFC, the retrosplenial cortex, and the medial thalamus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Prior research in awake animals has shown that virally‐mediated Kir2.1 expression results in a reduction of both evoked and spontaneous neuronal excitability lasting several weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In keeping with this, in vivo electrophysiological recordings in the PFC of mice unilaterally transfected with Kir2.1 revealed a robust reduction of spontaneous firing rate in the targeted cortical area with respect to its contralateral control regions (<italic>N</italic> = 4, paired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Chronic inhibition of the mouse PFC results in rsfMRI overconnectivity.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Viral expression localization.

        <p id="Par9">To corroborate the specificity of Kir2.1 findings and obtain mechanistic insight into the neural correlates of the observed fMRI overconnectivity, we designed a new set of experiments in which DREADD-based chemogenetics was employed to induce a time-controlled, acute inhibition of PFC activity during rsfMRI scanning.

Baseline electrophysiological traces revealed the presence of appreciable spontaneous multi-unit activity (MUA) in the PFC of both groups (mean firing rate 15.0 ± 2.2 spikes/s in hM4Di-expressing, and 14.1 ± 3.8 in GFP-transduced mice, <italic>n</italic> = 5 each group, <italic>p</italic> = 0.851, <italic>t</italic> test).

For each group, we compared the firing rates of each MUA site under basal conditions with those obtained in the same recording site upon CNO administration. A scatter plot of spike rate across paired conditions revealed that, during the active phase, the vast majority of MUA sites in DREADD-expressing mice showed a marked decrease in firing rate, with virtually no site showing any appreciable decrease in firing in control animals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>).

More broadly, our chemo-fMRI results show that acute inactivation of PFC activity results in a pattern of DMN overconnectivity closely recapitulating that observed with chronic Kir2.1-mediated neural inhibition, suggesting that the ensuing overconnectivity is not manipulation-specific, nor the indirect consequence of homeostatic reactivity to protracted neural suppression.</p>

We thus probed the rsfMRI connectivity of the thalamus to assess whether the observed foci of thalamic overconnectivity could underlie or involve the engagement of additional brain regions outside the DMN. To obtain a regionally unbiased identification of polymodal (i.e. densely-PFC projecting) versus more unimodal lateral portions of the thalamus, we used k-means (<italic>k</italic> = 1–3) and hierarchical clustering to partition thalamic voxels based on their whole-brain rsfMRI connectivity profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Consistent with the neuroanatomical organization of this region, our approach revealed two segregable thalamic sub-territories, one encompassing its centromedial and anterodorsal (PFC-innervated) polymodal components, and the second encompassing more lateral (unimodal/sensory) areas (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). This anatomical segregation is also of potential mechanistic interest, as polymodal thalamic areas have been recently shown to serve as key generators and cortical propagators of slow neural rhythms (e.g. δ) relevant to rsfMRI coupling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p>

This analysis revealed the presence of significant clusters of rsfMRI overconnectivity only in regions of the DMN and in polymodal thalamic areas of DREADD-expressing animals, the latter areas exhibiting overconnectivity with larger cortical regions. No meaningful clusters of rsfMRI over- or under-connectivity were otherwise observed in any of the areas probed.

        <p id="Par18">To investigate the relationship between DREADD-induced reduction in firing and the concomitant increase in local slow and δ oscillatory power, we next performed phase locking analyses of MUA firing in the PFC. Interestingly, our investigations revealed that in DREADD-expressing animals, the fewer residual spikes recorded after CNO injection exhibited strong phase locking to ongoing slow and δ LFP oscillations. Such strong phase locking was not observed in control animals or in baseline recordings, where spike distributions were instead more equally spread across δ and slow oscillation phases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c–e</xref>). These observations suggest that chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC leads to a selective reduction of firing not locked to ongoing slow rhythms, resulting in a concomitant increased phase locking of residual firing to high-excitability phases of ongoing low-frequency oscillations. The resulting spiking activity is therefore on average greatly reduced, but also considerably more periodic and phase-locked to underlying low-frequency oscillatory rhythms.</p>
        <p id="Par19">To better illustrate the relationship between increased oscillation power and enhanced spike locking in the slow and δ bands, we performed a simple simulation. Specifically, we first simulated spike trains to have weak phase locking to a slow rhythm, with spikes happening almost equally across phase angles of the oscillatory cycle as observed in control conditions. To mimic DREADD-induced effects, we next selectively removed spikes emitted at the non-preferred phases of slow oscillatory activity as observed in our recordings. To mimic DREADD-induced effects, we next selectively removed spikes emitted at the non-preferred phases of slow oscillatory activity as observed in our recordings. In keeping with our experimental results, this simple simulation showed that the removal of “asynchronous” off-preferred-phase firing reduces power of high-frequency spiking activity, while simultaneously increasing the power of the low-frequency rhythm residual spikes are entrained to (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). This suggests that DREADD-induced increase in slow LFP power does not necessarily reflect the generation of a new, “artificial” rhythm, but can be simply explained by the emergence of increased phase locking to existing slow oscillatory activity.</p>
        <p id="Par20">Finally, to further probe the mechanistic specificity of our findings, we measured rsfMRI connectivity profiles produced by cell-type-specific manipulations designed to increase local PFC firing. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of fast-spiking Parvalbumin (PV) GABAergic cells or hM3Dq-based excitation of pyramidal (CamkII-expressing) neurons both produced PFC underconnectivity with cortical terminals of the DMN (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). Notably, both manipulations produced neural signatures characterized by increased local firing rate and a robust shift of LFP power towards higher frequencies, effectively reversing the corresponding electrophysiological signature observed in our DREADD inhibition studies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These effects were far more prominent in mice undergoing DREADD-based stimulation of pyramidal neurons, a manipulation that was also associated with largely suppressed slow and δ-band LFP activity. Taken together, these new investigations suggest that the observed functional hyperconnectivity does not reflect an increased excitatory/inhibitory ratio in the PFC, or an unspecific functional inhibition of GABAergic neurons.</p>

We next computed inter-areal coherence between the envelope of ϒ-band amplitude because ultra-slow (~0.1 Hz) variation in ϒ-band envelope has been linked to arteriole dynamics and suggested to be a contributing factor to rsfMRI coupling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Mean coherence plots of ϒ-envelope over the ultra-slow frequency range (0.02–0.5 Hz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>) revealed only marginally increased CNO-induced coherence in hM4Di expressing mice (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9c</xref>). In keeping with this observation, we did not find evidence of significantly increased ultra-slow ϒ-envelope coherence (integrated between 0.02 to 0.5 Hz) between any electrode pairs (q &gt; 0.1, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, FDR corrected).</p>
        <p id="Par23">To link these oscillatory changes to the observed rsfMRI patterns, following the procedure described in Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, we next compared the obtained electrophysiological coherence values with corresponding (separately-measured) interareal rsfMRI connectivity in hM4Di and control animals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d, e</xref>). We first compared between-group band-specific LFP coherence differences across all electrode pairs with corresponding interareal rsfMRI connectivity changes measured during the active CNO phase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). These quantifications revealed that δ and slow LFP bands were the only frequency ranges exhibiting CNO-induced increased coherence between PFC-retrosplenial and PFC-thalamic electrode pairs, in agreement with the corresponding CNO-induced interareal rsfMRI connectivity increases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). While considerably smaller, between-group ultra-slow LFP gamma-envelope coherence also revealed CNO-induced increases in all the three electrode pairs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Other LFP bands did not show full concordance with rsfMRI findings: for example, β band coherence increased after CNO administration in PFC-retrosplenial but not in PFC-thalamus electrode pairs. Similarly, no meaningful between-group changes in power coherence upon DREADD stimulation was observed in the θ and γ LFP bands (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Further supporting a key contribution of slow and δ rhythms to the observed rsfMRI overconnectivity, we found that pairwise LFP coherence difference across all the recorded sites in these two bands exhibited a linear relationship with corresponding group-level pair-wise rsfMRI connectivity measured in both DREADD and control animals during the CNO active window (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>, δ <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.92, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002; slow <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.73, <italic>p</italic> = 0.029, uncorrected). Only δ LFP coupling however retained a significant correlation with rsfMRI connectivity upon FDR correction (<italic>q</italic> = 0.008, FDR corrected). A much weaker correlation between band-specific LFP coherence and pairwise rsfMRI connectivity was apparent for all the other bands (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.11 all bands). These findings were paralleled by the observation of similarly robust increased interareal δ- and slow-band LFP phase coherence, a widely used measure of functional synchronization in LFP/EEG studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Taken together, these results corroborate a neural origin for our imaging findings and implicate increased slow and δ LFP coherence as a plausible neural driver of the observed rsfMRI over-synchronization.</p>
        <p id="Par24">Our findings can be summarized in a simple illustrative scheme (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) in which chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC (node A) reduces high-frequency local activity via a preferential suppression of spikes not locked to ongoing, global low-frequency rhythms. This in turns produces a breakdown of high-frequency communication between the manipulated area and its targets (B and C). At the same time, the residual firing activity in the inhibited node becomes more entrained with ongoing low-frequency fluctuations, here depicted as a global slow rhythm. The observed functional overconnectivity may then reflect the resulting increase in interareal slow and δ LFP coherence, which we have empirically found, under our experimental conditions, to predict the direction and magnitude of rsfMRI coupling better than the coherence of faster rhythms. Importantly, this model is also broadly consistent with examinations of LFP signatures of directionality of interactions between areas (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>). Specifically, using phase-lag quantifications as a measure of information flow directionality, we found that in the δ band PFC activity preceded in phase retrosplenial cortex activity, a finding consistent with previous reports of antero-posteriorly traveling δ wave activity in the anesthetized mouse brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Consistent with our hypothesis, after CNO administration the phase difference between PFC and retrosplenial cortex in DREADD-expressing animals was greatly reduced, implying that chemogenetic suppressions of local high frequency results in more synchronous and less phase-lagged δ activity. This finding suggests that after chemogenetic inhibition, PFC activity becomes more entrained with global, slow covarying rhythms.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>A schematic illustration of our findings.</title><p>Chemogenetically inhibiting neural activity in cortical node A (i.e. PFC) reduces high-frequency direct interactions between the manipulated region and its targets (B and C), concomitantly producing higher entrainment of residual spiking activity with ongoing global low-frequency oscillations (node C).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par25">Here we combine neural perturbations and mouse rsfMRI to investigate how rsfMRI topography reconfigures in response to targeted cortical inactivation. We report that chronic and acute neural inactivation of the mouse PFC can counterintuitively increase rsfMRI connectivity with DMN targets directly innervated by the inhibited area. Electrophysiological investigations revealed that chemogenetic inactivation of the PFC preferentially and robustly suppresses the firing activity that is not phased locked to highly excitable peaks of ongoing slow-oscillatory rhythms, leading to increased slow and δ band power, and enhanced interareal low-frequency coherence. These observations argue against a neural-independent origin for the observed hyper-connectivity, and implicate low-frequency neural rhythms in the establishment of the observed rsfMRI overconnectivity.</p>
      <p id="Par26">While critically shaped and constrained by underlying axonal connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, spatiotemporal correlations in spontaneous rsfMRI activity can dynamically reconfigure in response to local perturbations. In-depth investigations of the reconfiguration patterns resulting from regional suppression of neural activity are of special interest. These allow for a targeted deconstruction of rsfMRI coupling and may offer opportunities to mechanistically interpret aberrant rsfMRI connectivity patterns in neurological conditions characterized by loss of cortical function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Leveraging the recent implementations of chemo-fMRI in the mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, we causally probed how neural suppression of cortical activity affects brain-wide rsfMRI coupling. In contrast to theoretical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and experimental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> evidence predicting that regional inactivation of a neural node would result in reduced functional synchronization with its direct anatomical targets, we found that both chronic and acute inhibition of the PFC can counterintuitively increase rsfMRI connectivity within thalamo-cortical substrates of the mouse DMN.</p>
      <p id="Par27">Our results advance our understanding of the principles underlying brain-wide rsfMRI coupling in two directions. First, we provide causal evidence that regional suppressions of brain activity does not necessarily lead to reduced neural and functional coupling between the inactivated area and its direct anatomical projection targets, but can result in increased rsfMRI connectivity via enhanced, less-localized slow oscillatory coherence. These observations point at a highly dynamic and non-monotonic relationship between structural and functional connectivity, underscoring a critical contribution of remote sources of large-scale neural covariation (e.g. δ and slow oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>) to the establishment of interareal rsfMRI coupling. This view is in keeping with correlational evidence of a dissociation between rsfMRI connectivity and underlying anatomical connections, such in the case of acallosal brains in which preserved bi-hemispheric connectivity has been repeatedly observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. It should be emphasized here that these results should not be intended as a refutation of the structural foundations of rsfMRI connectivity, but rather the basis of an updated framework in which reciprocal interareal rsfMRI coupling can be strongly biased, or even overridden, by slow synchronized input from global rhythm generators.</p>
      <p id="Par28">Second, our results also provide an updated reference framework for the interpretation and reverse engineering of rsfMRI overconnectivity observed in brain pathology, especially in degenerative or neurological states characterized by rsfMRI overconnectivity. While a neural mass phenomenon like interareal rsfMRI coupling cannot be mechanistically dissected into discrete circuital elements, our observation of foci of overconnectivity in polymodal thalamic areas and the increased synchronization of these with larger cortical territories is intriguing, as it points at a putative involvement of higher order thalamic relay in the generation (or propagation) of the observed overconnectivity. This hypothesis would be consistent with the observation that full expression of δ and slow oscillatory activity requires thalamic participation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, and with recent evidence pointing at the presence of a prefrontal-thalamic loop involved in the generation and propagation of δ synchronization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, other modulatory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> or subcortical substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> may similarly (or alternatively) play a role in the observed overconnectivity, and the identification of neural generators of rsfMRI coupling and their involvement in the reconfiguration of rsfMRI topography in response to local perturbations remain an open issue.</p>
      <p id="Par29">The observed increases in slow and δ band coherence upon inhibition of the PFC is in excellent agreement with previous reports of a robust association between spontaneous fMRI activity and slow oscillatory activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Our findings corroborate and expand these investigations by showing that reconfiguration of rsfMRI connectivity in response to local cortical inactivation is supported by increased interareal slow oscillatory coherence, a phenomenon reflecting DREADD-induced reduction of high-frequency firing, and concomitantly increased phase locking of residual spiking activity with ongoing global low-frequency oscillations. Recent work has linked ultra-slow (~0.1 Hz) variation in gamma-band amplitude to the vasomotor activity underlying intrinsic rsfMRI connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, suggesting that this rhythm may serve as a possible primary generator of interareal rsfMRI coupling. Interestingly, while we found evidence of ultra-slow ϒ envelope coherence across functionally connected areas under basal conditions (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9c</xref>), the corresponding coherence increases upon chemogenetic manipulations were very small and did not correlate with corresponding pairwise rsfMRI overconnectivity. This finding suggests that, under the conditions of our manipulations, rsfMRI overconnectivity is most plausibly explained by increased canonical band (e.g. δ) low-frequency inter-areal coherence.</p>
      <p id="Par30">Although the light sedation protocol used in our measurements enhances slow oscillatory rhythms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, such a brain state is unlikely to be the primary reason for our observation of rsfMRI overconnectivity. Supporting this notion, increased rsfMRI connectivity between homotopic cortical regions has been observed in awake humans upon inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Analgously increased rsfMRI overconnectivity and δ hyper-synchronization have also been observed patients with stroke and in early stage Alzheimer’s disease imaged in conscious conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Given the highly dynamic nature of rsfMRI network activity, the sign and neurophysiological signatures identified in this study could however conceivably be affected by arousal levels. In this respect, a recent report of rsfMRI underconnectivity after chemogenetic inhibition of the rat postero-dorsal cingulate cortex is of interest in the light of a possible high-arousal state of these awake, restrained animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. While the lack of electrophysiological recordings in this study prevents a direct comparison with our findings, high-arousal conditions are characterized by a robust shift towards high-frequency LFP activity and a possibly dominant contribution of direct feedforward interactions to interareal communication. Under these conditions, the synchronizing contribution of slow oscillatory activity may thus be largely reduced, and chemogenetic inhibition could thus produce qualitatively different effects. As robust methods for mapping rsfMRI activity in awake mice are becoming available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, systematic investigations of the effect of DREADD inhibition as a function of arousal state may help probe the plausibility of this model.</p>
      <p id="Par31">Interestingly, TMS investigations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> also show that excitatory pulse stimulations may produce rsfMRI de-synchronization, pointing at a possible general, inverse relationship between local cortical activity and interareal rsfMRI coupling. An analogous relationship might also be present in the mouse because, reconstituting the results of our control experiments, decreased rsfMRI connectivity has been recently observed with excitatory DREADD stimulation of somato-motor areas in lightly anesthetized animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. This relationship however requires further corroboration, as KORD-based chemogenetic inhibition of the cingulate cortex was instead reported by others to produce rsfMRI underconnectivity in anesthetized mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. These inconsistencies reveal the critical need to couple perturbational rsfMRI studies with electrophysiological recordings to confirm the effect of the designated manipulation, and relate changes in rsfMRI connectivity to underlying neural rhythms.</p>
      <p id="Par32">A strength of our approach is the use of translationally-relevant fMRI-based readouts enabling a possible extrapolation of experimental findings to analogous human research. However, some limitations need to be recognized when assessing the generalizability of our results across species and conditions. First, the magnitude and direction of rsfMRI connectivity produced by neuronal inhibition could be manipulation specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, an effect that in the case of chemogenetics might also be compounded by possible off-target effects of commonly used chemogenetic actuators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. By employing unlike others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>, a design in which CNO is administered under all conditions to all experimental groups, we were able to rigorously control any confounding effect of this actuator via a direct contrast of CNO-treated control and DREADD-expressing animals. As a result, the effects we report in the manuscript are to be attributed to the sole DREADD activation. The observation that chronic inhibition with Kir2.1 reconstitutes the overconnectivity obtained under DREADD manipulation increases our confidence in the validity of our mechanistic inferences. Second, it should be emphasized that the mechanisms that we report here may not be necessarily applicable to awake, behaving conditions, as task-dependent cognitive and sensory processing may strongly and dynamically bias brain rhythms and interregional coupling beyond what could be inferred in the resting, sedated brain. This aspect however does not diminish the translational impact of our findings, owing to the prominent use of resting-state fMRI to map functional network activity and our current inability to back-translate rsfMRI signatures of brain dysfunction into physiologically interpretable events.</p>
      <p id="Par33">In conclusion, the present work provides causal evidence that inhibition of a cortical region can lead to counterintuitively increased patterns of rsfMRI connectivity, an effect mediated by increased interareal slow-frequency coherence. These findings point at a non-monotonic relationship between regional cortical activity and network-wide rsfMRI connectivity, and define testable network-level mechanisms for the emergence of rsfMRI overconnectivity in clinical conditions characterized by loss of cortical function.</p>

          <p id="Par44">To relate the strength of underlying anatomical connectivity to the regions exhibiting increased rsfMRI connectivity with voxel resolution, we extracted outgoing projections from the affected PFC regions using a spatially-resampled (0.027 mm<sup>3</sup>) version of a voxel scale model of the Allen Brain Institute structural connectome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. We then plotted the strength of PFC-departing structural projections against the corresponding between-group difference in rsfMRI connectivity using the cluster-corrected difference map and assessed differences in the distribution of overconnected areas with respect to all the brain voxels using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p>
          <p id="Par45">To quantify the contribution of distinct thalamic subregions to overall group differences, we used k-means clustering to partition voxels within the thalamus, based on whole-brain rsfMRI group-difference obtained using the PFC seed as recently described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>. This approach revealed two major thalamic clusters, one medial and one bilateral partition encompassing sensory areas. Seed-based functional connectivity was subsequently computed for each of the two-resultant k-means clusters independently, and the resulting functional connectivity maps were compared and quantified across cortical VOIs.</p>

        <title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
        <p id="Par46">Electrophysiological recordings were carried out in animals subjected to the same animal preparation and sedation regime employed for rsfMRI mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction), intubated, artificially ventilated (2% maintenance), and head-fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting). The tail vein was cannulated for CNO injection. To ensure maximal consistency between viral injections and recording site, the skull surface was exposed and an insertion hole in the right PFC was gently drilled through the skull corresponding to the location of prior viral injection point. A single shank electrode (Neuronexus, USA, interelectrode spacing 1–2.5 mm) was next inserted through the overlying dura mater by a microdrive array system (Kopf Instruments, Germany) at an insertion rate of 1 µm/min to reach the same stereotaxic coordinates employed for viral injection. The site receptive fields were plotted manually and the position and size of each field were stored together with the acquisition data. After electrode insertion, isoflurane was discontinued and replaced by halothane at a maintenance level of 0.75% to induce rsfMRI-comparable sedation. Electrophysiological data acquisition commenced 1 h after isoflurane cessation. Such transition time was required to ensure complete washout of isoflurane anesthesia and avoid residual burst-suppressing activity associated with extended exposure to deep anesthetic levels.</p>
        <p id="Par47">Neural activity was next recorded in consecutive 5 min time bins to cover a 15 min pre-injection time window, and a 60 min post CNO timeframe in <italic>n</italic> = 5 hM4Di and <italic>n</italic> = 5 GFP-expressing mice. Signals were amplified using an RHD 2000 amplifier system (Intan Technologies, RHD Recording Controller Software, v2.09) to acquire electrophysiological data at a sampling rate of 20 kHz. For CamkII-hM3D(Gq) (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and PV-hM4D(Gi) (<italic>n</italic> = 6) experiments we acquired respectively <italic>n</italic> = 4 and <italic>n</italic> = 7 control animals. In the case of control Kir2.1 recordings, a four shank electrode was inserted along the coronal plane to bi-hemispherically cover the right (Kir2.1-expressing) and left (GFP-expressing) PFC (<italic>n</italic> = 4). The left region served as internal reference control to better assess the efficacy of Kir2.1 neural inhibition. Electrophysiological signals were then recorded into 5 min time bins to cover a 35-min time-window.</p>
        <p id="Par48">To measure multi-electrode coherence, three electrodes were inserted in key cortical and subcortical substrates identified as overconnected in our chemo-fMRI mapping in <italic>n</italic> = 4 hM4Di and <italic>n</italic> = 5 GFP-expressing mice. A multi-probe micromanipulator (New-Scale Technologies) was used to insert three 16 channels single shank electrode (Neuronexus, USA, interelectrode spacing 1–2.5 mm) in the right prefrontal cortex, centromedial thalamus, and retrosplenial cortex, respectively. Representative electrode locations are reported in Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>, corresponding to the following stereotaxic coordinates: PFC 1.7 mm AP, ±0.3 mm ML, −1.7 mm DV; mediodorsal thalamus: −1.7 mm AP, −0.3 mm ML, −3.5 mm DV (5° insertion angle); retrosplenial cortex: −2.4 mm AP, −0.3 mm ML, −1.3 mm DV. To reduce tissue damage, an insertion rate &lt; 1 µm/min was employed, allowing for a 30-min equilibration every 400 µm traveled. Ground electrodes were put in contact with the cerebral brain fluid through a window drilled in the skull. Signals were then recorded into 1 min time bins to cover a 15-min pre-injection baseline and a 40-min post CNO time window.</p>

        <title>LFP and multi-unit activity</title>
        <p id="Par49">To compute the LFP signal, raw extracellular recordings were first down-sampled to 4 kHz, then band-pass filtered to 1–250 Hz using a two-step procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. Briefly, raw timeseries were first low-pass filtered using a 4th order Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 1 kHz. The resulting timeseries were next down-sampled to 2 kHz, then again filtered using a Kaiser window filter between 1 Hz to 250 Hz (with a sharp transition bandwidth of 1 Hz, passband ripple of 0.01 dB and a stop band attenuation of 60 dB) and then resampled at 1 kHz. All the filtering was applied both in forward and backward temporal direction to avoid any phase transitions due to filtering.</p>
        <p id="Par50">To compute multi-unity activity (MUA) we again followed the procedure described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. Briefly, we computed a band-passed high-frequency signal using a 4th order Butterworth filter with a &lt;100 Hz cut off frequency, then band-pass filtered between 400 and 3000 Hz using a Kaiser window filter (with transition band of 50 Hz, stopband attenuation of 60 dB, and passband ripple of 0.01 dB). From the high-frequency signal we detected spike times using a spike detection threshold corresponding to 4-times the median of the high-frequency signal, then divided by 0.6745 as suggested in Quiroga et al. (2004). Spikes were considered to be biologically plausible, and as such retained in these computations, only if occurring more than 1 ms apart.</p>
        <p id="Par51">To quantify effectiveness of Kir2<italic>.1</italic> in suppressing spontaneous activity, firing rate was computed (in units of spikes/s) by dividing the number of spikes per electrode by the recording duration in seconds. The resulting spike rates were averaged across the channels corresponding to the virally targeted or control region. The average spike rate for four subjects was next tested against each other using paired <italic>t</italic> test. To assess the effect of chemo-fMRI manipulations, spiking activity was computed in experimental and control animals as described above and segmented into one-minute bins. We next computed the channel-averaged firing rate for each segment, and normalized this value with respect to the firing rate recorded during baseline (pre-CNO) period. The resulting baseline-normalized firing rate index was then used to assess changes in spiking rate upon CNO injection in the two experimental cohorts.</p>
        <p id="Par52">To determine the time lag at which different firing rate samples from the same channels could be considered as approximately statistically independent, we computed for each subject the autocorrelation of the channel-averaged firing rate for each subject and computed the time lag after which the autocorrelation function drops below the 95th percentile. We then, for each subject, retained samples of the baseline-normalized firing rate at different times separated by the above obtained lags. We next separately analyzed the baseline-normalized rates in three different periods: 0–15 min (transient time), 15–35 min, and 35–55 min after CNO the injection (active time). We pooled all the retained data points in these windows both over time and over subjects and then compared the median between the two populations using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The obtained <italic>p</italic>-values were corrected using a Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction.</p>
        <p id="Par53">LFP spectrograms were computed using a Fourier transform with a Kaiser window with a frequency resolution of 0.15 Hz, temporal resolution of 6 s, and with 50% overlapping windows. Spectrograms and their differences were smoothed in time with the resolution of 30 s, and in frequency with the resolution of 1 Hz using a median filter. To quantify the effect of CNO on LFP rhythms, we computed a spectrogram modulation index as follows. First, we computed the channel-averaged spectrograms for the duration of the baseline recording. Next, we averaged time-frequency spectral profiles over time, resulting in frequency-resolved spectral profiles. The effect of CNO was next assessed by computing a modulation index, defined as the ratio of channel-averaged spectrogram after injection minus baseline, time-averaged spectrogram, and the sum of the same quantities, for every time window and for every frequency. This modulation index ranges between -1 and 1 and describes the changes due to drug injection over time for each frequency.</p>
        <p id="Par54">To obtain a statistical assessment of CNO effects across groups and bands, we computed the autocorrelation of spectrograms for every subject at every frequency, using (as for our assessment of firing rate) only spectrograms computed at time points far enough to be approximately statistically independent. The time lag to determine such approximately independent points was identified as the interval after which the spectrum’s autocorrelation function dropped below the 95th percentile. We next computed the median of the modulation index over different frequency bands defined as follows: slow (0.1–1 Hz), δ (1–4 Hz), θ (4–8 Hz), α (8–12 Hz), β (12–30 Hz), and ƴ (30–70 Hz). Data within each band were pooled over uncorrelated time points (determined as above by taking time samples separated by lags at which autocorrelation became negligible) and over subjects, and the population medians were compared using two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, followed by FDR correction.</p>

          <title>Multielectrode coherence</title>
          <p id="Par55">Channel-averaged spectrograms were preprocessed as described above. Raw spectral power coherence was assessed by computing the magnitude of squared coherency using Welch’s overlapped averaged periodogram method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup> with a 50% overlapping window of 2 s length. Coherence was calculated for every 60-s bin of channel-averaged recordings. Temporal smoothing was carried out using a 60-s median filter as described above. CNO spectrograms (30–40 post CNO injection window) were normalized with respect to the last 3 min of pre-CNO baseline using a modulation index as before. To obtain a quantifiable assessment of the CNO effect across different groups and bands, data within each band were pooled into 60-s bins. Subject and the population medians were compared for each region separately using one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, followed by FDR correction. The use of 60 s bins was motivated by estimations of the time lags at which autocorrelation of electrophysiological signals drops below the 95th percentile value (and thus samples are approximately independent) as described above.</p>
          <p id="Par56">To assess changes in ultra-slow fluctuations in the ϒ band envelope of LFP, following the work from Nir et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, we computed LFP data spectrogram for the last 10 min of baseline and 30–40 min of post injection window, using a moving window of 2 s width and 0.75 percent overlap, resulting in an estimation of the resulting ultra-slow power for each 0.5 s interval. The ϒ-band envelope was computed as the integrated power of the spectrograms in the ϒ band 30–70 Hz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The power spectrum of this time series was next computed, after correction for 1/f component<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, revealing a peak in the 0.02–0.05 Hz region. Interareal coherence was then computed as described above for both experimental and control mice. To assess the effect of chemogenetic manipulations, we defined a coherence modulation index as described above for other frequency bands. Between group statistical assessments were carried out using two‐sided Wilcoxon rank‐sum tests, followed by FDR correction.</p>
          <p id="Par57">To quantify interregional phase coupling, LFP data were first filtered using a third order Butterworth filter in delta band, and the instantaneous phase of each channel was computed by taking the phase of the analytical signal resulted from the Hilbert transform.

In the first scenario, representing the DREADD conditions, we generated 100 spikes (rate of 10 spikes per second) tightly distributed around the preferred phase π with values taken from a von Mises distribution with an extremely high value (20) of the concentration parameter. For the second case (representing sham condition), we added 100 more spikes distributed almost randomly across phases, with values taken from a von Mises distribution with an extremely low value (0.5) of the concentration parameter. We then smoothed spike temporal components with a Gaussian kernel (100 ms width) and computed the power spectra of the resulting spike train with the multitaper method (Matlab pspectrum function).</p>

We considered for this analysis the slow and δ bands. Signal in each band was band-passed using a 3rd order Butterworth filter. To measure the locking of spikes to specific phases of each band, we considered the distribution of the LFP phase values at the time of each MUA spike. From this distribution, we computed the phase locking value (PLV) as 1 minus the circular variance of this distribution (Methods Section “Multielectrode coherence”). PLV ranges from 0 (no locking or relationship between phase and spike times) to 1 (perfect locking of spikes to a certain phase). As for other quantities, we also computed a PLV modulation index as the difference of PLV values between the active-drug and baseline periods divided by the sum of PLV values in the active-drug and baseline periods. A two-sided Wilcoxon was used to check if the median PLV modulation index is higher for the experimental data with respect to control data.</p>
