Number of communities,Number of independent communities detected in a group of specific ROIs. Estimated maximum number of statistically significant clusters in a random network.,Number of independent communities detected in a group of specific ROIs. Estimated maximum number of statistically significant clusters in a random network.
Mean of the path lengths,The path length of a node i (Li) is the average number of edges that must be crossed to go from node i to the remaining nodes in the network,"Li=∑iϵN(1n−1∑jϵN,j≠idij)where N is the total number of nodes in the network, n is the number of nodes involved and dij is the shortest path length between node i and j."
Standard deviation of the path lengths,"The characteristic path length is a global measure of the network, i.e., there is only one value for the entire network. It consists of the average path length of each node in the network.",L=1N∑iϵNLi
Functional Segregation (FS),Functional Segregation (FS),Functional Segregation (FS)
Global clustering coefficient,"This is the average value of the clustering coefficients, which is the fraction of triangles around a node, and is equivalent to the fraction of neighbors of the node that are neighbors among them.",C=∑Γi∑ki(ki−1)
Number of triangles,This is the number of connected triangles that can be estimated within a network in Euclidean space.,"G=(V,E)An ordered pair in which V is a nonempty set of vertices and E is a set of edges. Where E consists of unordered pairs of vertices such as {x, y} E, then x and y are said to be adjacent."

Density,The network density (D) is the number of edges in the network in proportion to the total number of possible edges.,D=KN(N−1)where K is the number of edges in the network and N is the total number of nodes in the network.
Small world (Watts–Strogatz),"Networks that present a higher clustering coefficient than expected by chance and that, in addition, have a characteristic shortest path length.",S=CnormLnorm=C/CrandomL/LrandomA network is said to represent this type of organization if the calculated index is greater than 1.
Complexity,The number of nodes and alternative paths that exist within a specific network,The number of nodes and alternative paths that exist within a specific network
