Consistency of the entire connectivity profile across the two sessions. Identification accuracies are reported for predicting identity in Session 2 from Session 1 (top) and vice versa (bottom). Results are reported for rDCM (middle) and for functional connectivity estimates (right). For both methods, results are shown for all HCP paradigms as well as for the two whole-brain parcellation schemes (i.e., Glasser, Schaefer). Furthermore, results are reported for two different \u201cmodes\u201d of estimation (see main text for details): (a) fixed network architecture (i.e., classical rDCM and Pearson correlation coefficient), and (b) sparsity constraints (i.e., rDCM with sparsity constraints and L1-regularized partial correlations).", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_003.csv"}
