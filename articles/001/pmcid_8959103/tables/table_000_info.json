{"table_id": "T1", "table_label": "Table 1.\u2003", "table_caption": "Across-session consistency of group-level model parameter estimates for rDCM and functional connectivity. Consistency of parameter estimates in terms of the Pearson correlation coefficient between group-level (i.e., averaged across participants) estimates of Session 1 (\u201ctest\u201d) and Session 2 (\u201cretest\u201d). Group-level consistencies are reported for the connectivity and driving input parameters of rDCM (middle) as well as for the functional connectivity estimates (right). For both methods, results are shown for all HCP paradigms as well as for the two whole-brain parcellation schemes (i.e., Glasser, Schaefer). Furthermore, results are reported for two different \u201cmodes\u201d of estimation (see main text for details): (a) fixed network architecture (i.e., classical rDCM and Pearson correlation coefficient), and (b) sparsity constraints (i.e., sparse rDCM and L1-regularized partial correlations). All correlations were significant at a significance threshold of p < 0.05 (Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons).", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_000.csv"}
