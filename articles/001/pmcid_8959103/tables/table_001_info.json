Test-retest reliability of parameter estimates was assessed in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between estimates of Session 1 (\u201ctest\u201d) and Session 2 (\u201cretest\u201d) for a fixed (full) network architecture (i.e., classical rDCM and Pearson correlation coefficient). Here, we report the mean (averaged across parameters) ICC value and 95% confidence interval (CI). Averaging of the connection-wise ICC values as well as computing the 95% CI was achieved by (a) transforming connection-wise ICC values to z-space using Fisher z-transformation, (b) computing mean as well as lower and upper bound of the 95% CI in z-space, and finally (c) back-transforming estimates to r-space. Test-retest reliability is reported for the connectivity and driving input parameter estimates of rDCM (middle) as well as for the functional connectivity estimates (right). For both methods, results are shown for all HCP paradigms for the Glasser atlas (see Supporting Information Table S1 for the respective results of the Schaefer atlas). Furthermore, results are shown for a all parameters (top row), b significant parameters (middle row), and c top 1,000 parameters (bottom row).", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_001.csv"}
