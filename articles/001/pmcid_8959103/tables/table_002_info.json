{"table_id": "T3", "table_label": "Table 3.\u2003", "table_caption": "Test-retest reliability of model parameter estimates for regression DCM and functional connectivity (sparsity constraints). Test-retest reliability of parameter estimates was assessed in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between estimates of Session 1 (\u201ctest\u201d) and Session 2 (\u201cretest\u201d) for sparsity constraints (i.e., rDCM with sparsity constraints and L1-regularized partial correlations). Here, we report the mean (averaged across parameters) ICC value and 95% confidence interval (CI). Averaging of the connection-wise ICC values as well as computing the 95% CI was done in z-space (see caption of Table 2 for details). Test-retest reliability is reported for the connectivity and driving input estimates of rDCM (middle) as well as for the functional connectivity estimates (right). For both methods, results are shown for all HCP paradigms for the Glasser atlas (see Supporting Information Table S2 for the respective results of the Schaefer atlas). Furthermore, results are shown for a all parameters (top row), b significant parameters (middle row), and c top 1,000 parameters (bottom row).", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_002.csv"}
