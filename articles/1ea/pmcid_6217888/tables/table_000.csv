Metric,Description
Clustering coefficient,The fraction of the nodes of a given neighbor that are also neighbors of each other reflects segregation/subspecialization in the network
,
Modularity,The degree to which nodes tend to segregate into relatively independent modules reflects segregation/subspecialization within the network
,
Path length,The minimum number of edges required to traverse the distance between 2 nodes averaged over the network reflects the ease of information transfer across the network
,
Global efficiency,Inverse of the mean characteristic path length averaged over the network reflects integration in the network
