      <abstract id="ABS1">
        <p id="P1">Even when subjects are at rest, it is thought that brain activity is
organized into distinct brain states during which reproducible patterns are
observable. Yet, it is unclear how to define or distinguish different brain
states. A potential source of brain state variation is arousal, which may play a
role in modulating functional interactions between brain regions. Here, we use
simultaneous resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
pupillometry to study the impact of arousal levels indexed by pupil area on the
integration of large-scale brain networks. We employ a novel sparse dictionary
learning-based method to identify hub regions participating in between-network
integration stratified by arousal, by measuring <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness, the
number (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>) of functionally overlapping networks in each brain
region. We show evidence of a brain-wide decrease in between-network integration
and inter-subject variability at low relative to high arousal, with differences
emerging across regions of the frontoparietal, default mode, motor, limbic, and
cerebellum networks. State-dependent changes in <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness
relate to the actual patterns of network integration within these hubs,
suggesting a brain state transition from high to low arousal characterized by
global synchronization and reduced network overlaps. We demonstrate that arousal
is not limited to specific brain areas known to be directly associated with
arousal regulation, but instead has a brain-wide impact that involves high-level
between-network communications. Lastly, we show a systematic change in pairwise
fMRI signal correlation structures in the arousal state-stratified data, and
demonstrate that the choice of global signal regression could result in
different conclusions in conventional graph theoretical analysis and in the
analysis of <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness when studying arousal modulations.
Together, our results suggest the presence of global and local effects of
pupil-linked arousal modulations on resting state brain functional
connectivity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Fluctuations of brain and behavioral states during wakefulness are linked
with our ability to observe and interact with a changing environment (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">Zagha and McCormick, 2014</xref>). In the absence of external tasks, arousal, a
behavioral state of being alert, awake, and attentive (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Joshi and Gold, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Liu
and Falahpour, 2020</xref>), is a potential source of brain state variations or
time-varying patterns of brain activity during resting state. Recent neuroimaging
studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) show that there are
neural correlates of arousal in the cerebral cortex (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Breeden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">DiNuzzo et al.,
2019</xref>; <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>;
<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Yellin et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to key
brain regions of the ascending arousal system, thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical
neural pathways are involved in modulation of arousal (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">McCormick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Paasonen et al.,
2018</xref>), suggesting a role of arousal on functional interactions between
brain regions. How arousal modulates functional brain organization during resting
state remains poorly understood (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Barttfeld et al.,
2015</xref>; <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Shine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">Yeo et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P3">Functional connectivity is widely used to infer a relationship between brain
regions by measuring the temporal correlation strength of the
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Integration of distinct brain regions
can be described by connecting nodes (each representing a brain region) based on the
strength of functional connectivity between them (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>). In graph theory, hubs are defined as the
nodes with a large number of connections to other nodes using pairwise correlation
matrix (<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2013</xref>). Among hubs,
connector hubs play a key role in communications between networks, each being a set
of inter-connected nodes. Connector hubs are thought to reconfigure their functional
connectivity to adapt to changes in brain states such as tasks (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bertolero et al., 2015</xref>) or arousal (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Boveroux et al., 2010</xref>). Brain-wide decreases in network
integration were found in patients in the comatose state (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Achard et al., 2012</xref>), under propofol-induced sedation
(<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Schrouff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Vatansever et al., 2020</xref>) and sleep (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Boly
et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Cross et al., 2021</xref>).
Still, the much more subtle question as to whether modulations in arousal during
resting state are associated with brain-wide connector hub re-organization remains
largely unexplored in healthy non-pharmacologically altered participants (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Shine et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P4">In addition, functional connectivity as measured by resting state fMRI
involves complex information resulting from a variety of neurobiological,
hemodynamic, and physiological components (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Cole et
al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Castillo et al.,
2019</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Lurie et al., 2020</xref>).
Components of time-varying functional connectivity at rest have been linked to
consciousness (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Barttfeld et al., 2015</xref>) and
ongoing cognition (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Castillo et al.,
2015</xref>). Other studies have observed time-varying resting state functional
connectivity associated with sampling variability, motion artifacts, sleep states
(<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Haimovici et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2017</xref>), physiological noise (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2013</xref>), neurovascular coupling
(<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Archila-Meléndez et al., 2020</xref>),
eyelid closures (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) or eye movements (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Koba et al., 2021</xref>). Electroencephalography
(EEG) markers of arousal, e.g. alpha power, were negatively correlated with fMRI
global signal (<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). Arousal
fluctuations indexed by eyelid opening and intracortical EEG had negative
correlations with cortical fMRI signals accompanied by thalamocortical
anti-correlation (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2016</xref>).
Decreases in EEG vigilance were associated with increases in thalamocortical
anticorrelation in fMRI (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2018</xref>)
and decreases in anticorrelation between the default mode and task-positive networks
(<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). A similar result was
found using the degree of eyelid closure as a proxy of arousal state in sleep
deprived individuals (<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).
Arousal-dependent changes in resting state functional connectivity suggest a
relation to behavior and cognition. More anticorrelation between the default mode
and task-positive networks at peristimulus times at a psychomotor vigilance task was
correlated with faster performances (<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et
al., 2013</xref>). Using the analysis of coherence and phase-shift between fMRI
and arousal fluctuations, it is suggested that a traveling wave linked to arousal
offers a parsimonious account for spatiotemporal features of resting state fMRI
signals, including the global organization of functional connectivity gradients
(<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Raut et al., 2021</xref>). There were
time-locked relationships between the topology of resting state functional
connectivity, activity of the ascending arousal system, low dimensional energy
landscapes, and spatiotemporal travelling waves (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Munn et al., 2021</xref>). To this end, how changes in arousal are linked to
functional connectivity reconfiguration is a key question in understanding
connectivity dynamics and could contribute to the heterogeneity of resting state
functional connectivity patterns across subjects (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Barttfeld et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al.,
2017</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Falahpour,
2020</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P5">However, level of arousal is not routinely monitored in most resting state
fMRI studies, making it challenging to explore its impact on functional
connectivity. Pupillometry has an ability to track the level of arousal or
behavioral states during wakefulness by measuring changes in pupil size, without a
need to place EEG electrodes on the scalp (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Joshi and
Gold, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Falahpour,
2020</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">McCormick et al., 2020</xref>).
Converging evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that pupil-linked arousal
modulates both the BOLD time-series and patterns of functional connectivity.
Fluctuations of pupil diameter were associated with resting state BOLD time-series
and the antagonism between regions of the default mode and sensorimotor cortex
(<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Yellin et al., 2015</xref>). Pupil dilation was
associated with increased BOLD activity of the salience network, frontoparietal
regions and the thalamus (<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al.,
2016</xref>). Using graph theory, spontaneous fluctuations of pupil diameter
were correlated with between-network integration during rest, suggesting a link
between neural gain and connector hubs (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Munn et al.,
2021</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Shine, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Shine et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, it remains unclear how arousal
modulates the topology of brain’s functional organizations during resting
state and what the role of connector hubs is in arousal level-dependent network
reorganization.</p>
      <p id="P6">To explore this, we identify and quantify changes in between-network
integration stratified by arousal and examine its contribution to inter-subject
functional connectivity variability. We hypothesize that resting state networks
reorganize with arousal fluctuations. Specifically, we expect between-network
integration to be lower at low relative to high arousal, based on the previous work
showing a positive relationship between the fluctuations of pupil diameter and
global between-network integration (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Shine et al.,
2016</xref>). To estimate network integration from resting state fMRI is
challenging, due to the multicollinearity of networks when the time-courses of brain
networks may be themselves related. In addition, it is unlikely that the brain is
organized into several non-overlapping networks, instead, the functional brain
organizations may involve overlaps associated with multiple functional processes
that a region participates. For example, using a sparsity-based analysis of reliable
<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness (SPARK)(<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al.,
2016</xref>), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) has been shown to participate
in two sub-networks of default mode, where one involves the midline components (the
PCC and medial prefrontal cortex) and another involves the midline, lateral
(inferior parietal lobe), and mesial (hippocampus) components. In this example,
network overlap is observed at one of the core regions of the default mode network,
rather than at its anatomical boundaries. A similar result was found using an
innovative co-activation pattern analysis (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Karahanoğlu and Van De Ville, 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P7">To test this hypothesis, we collected resting state fMRI simultaneously with
in-scanner pupillometry data from 27 healthy participants, in order to use
pupillometry as an index of arousal (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Larsen and
Waters, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>;
<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>). We stratify high
and low arousal states by ranked pupil area and estimate connector hubs in each
state, using a recently introduced method; SParse dictionary learning based Analysis
of Reliable K-hubness (SPARK)(<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al.,
2018</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). SPARK identifies a
set of individually consistent networks and defines connector hubs by measuring
“<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness”, or the number (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>)
of functionally overlapping networks for each node (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). We show
evidence of a brain-wide decrease in between-network integration and inter-subject
variability of connector hubs in low versus high arousal resting states. By studying
the hierarchical network organization of connector hubs, we observe that arousal is
not localized to specific brain areas known to be directly associated with arousal
regulation, but instead has a more extensive, brain-wide impact that involves
high-level between-network communications. Lastly, we investigate if global signal
regression has an impact on the pairwise fMRI signal correlation structures in the
arousal state-stratified data, the analysis of hubs using conventional Graph theory,
and the analysis of <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness using SPARK. We demonstrate that the
choice of global signal regression could result in different conclusions in
conventional graph theoretical analysis and in the analysis of
<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness, and suggest the presence of global and local effects of
pupil-linked arousal modulations on resting state brain functional connectivity.</p>

        <p id="P8">This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Yale
University. We recruited 37 healthy young adults (26.68 ± 4.18 years old;
20/17 females/males; 35/2 right/left-handed. Mean ± standard deviation)
from the community of Yale University. Participants had to meet the following
inclusion criteria: i) no claustrophobia or ferromagnetic metal in the body, ii)
no clinical diagnosis of cognitive or mental disorders, iii) no visual
impairments or difficulty in vision without glasses or contact lenses, and iv)
no auditory impairments. Subjects were instructed to have a normal sleep before
the day of scan and reported 7 ± 1 hours of sleep during the past 24
hours prior to the scan, with a neutral sleep quality scoring 3.4 ± 0.8
out of the five self-rating items: 1 (very bad), 2 (fairly bad), 3 (neutral), 4
(fairly good), 5(very good). Subjects reported a mild level of fatigue scoring 1
± 0.7 out of the five self-rating items: 4 (worst possible fatigue), 3
(severe fatigue), 2 (moderate fatigue), 1 (mild fatigue), 0 (energetic, no
fatigue). After data preprocessing, 10 subjects were excluded based on the
following criteria: i) motion, estimated as the mean frame-to-frame displacement
(FFD) &gt; 0.15 mm in either of two resting state fMRI runs (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Horien et al., 2019</xref>), ii) more than 35% of missing
datapoints in the pupillometry data, or iii) missing data due to technical
problems. Given these criteria, we included 27 subjects (26.52 ± 4.04
years old; 16/11 females/males; 25/2 right/left-handed) in our analyses. The
mean FFD was 0.06 ± 0.02 mm for rest 1 and 0.06 ± 0.02 mm for rest
2 across the finally selected 27 subjects. Across the 27 subjects, the percent
of discarded time-points was 6.02 ± 9.48 % for rest 1 and 4.33 ±
8.33 % for rest 2. See <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table

scanner at the Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center. T1-weighted anatomical
images were acquired using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE)
pulse sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2,400 ms,
echo time (TE) = 1.22 ms, flip angle = 8°, slice thickness = 1 mm,
in-plane resolution = 1 × 1 mm, matrix size = 256 × 256,
field-of-view(FOV) = 256 mm, 208 contiguous slices acquired in the sagittal
plane. Functional T2* -weighted BOLD images were acquired using a multiband
gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence (TR = 1000 ms, TE = 30 ms,
flip angle = 55°, multiband acceleration factor = 5, slice thickness = 2
mm, in-plane resolution = 2 × 2 mm<sup>2</sup>, matrix size= 100 ×
100, FOV = 220 mm, 75 contiguous slices acquired in the axial-oblique planes
parallel to AC-PC line). Two resting state fMRI scans were acquired for each
subject. Subjects were instructed to stay still, think of nothing in particular,
and maintain fixation on the white cross in the middle of black screen. Total
duration of each functional run was 6:50 min (410 frames). The two resting state
runs were acquired with an interval of approximately 40-50 minutes between them
in the same session, without leaving the scanner, except one subject who needed
to use restroom. Between the two rest runs, five task fMRI data were acquired
for an independent study that is not part of this work. Eye-tracking data were
recorded using a MR-compatible infrared EyeLink 1000 Plus eye-tracking system
(SR Research Ltd. Ottawa, ON, Canada) to measure time-varying changes in pupil
area with a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz. In the EyeLink 1000 system, a centroid
fitting model was used for pupil tracking. We performed a five-point calibration
and validation before each functional run to minimize the potential impacts of
between-scan difference in measurement environment and subject motion.</p>

        <title>Pupillometry data preprocessing</title>
        <p id="P10">Eye-tracking data were preprocessed using custom code in MATLAB R2018a.
Eye blinks were automatically identified by EyeLink tracker’s online
parser. Blink-induced artifacts were corrected using 4-point spline
interpolation (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Mathôt et al.,
2013</xref>). Blinks that occurred shortly after each other (&lt; 100 ms)
were combined and treated as a single blink (<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>). The signals were low-pass filtered using a
first-order Butterworth filter at cut-off 0.5 Hz, after which the first 10,000
data points (i.e., 10 s) were removed to synch with the fMRI data. The
time-course was down-sampled by averaging 1,000 consecutive frames for each 1 s
bin, to match the fMRI sampling frequency (1 Hz). Pupil area was z-transformed
using the mean and standard deviation over the rest 1 and 2, to control for
variability in average pupil area across subjects. To account for the slow
response time of the pupil to neuronal activity (<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>), each time-course was convolved with the
canonical HRF generated based on the mixture of two Gamma functions using SPM8
(<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Friston et al., 1998</xref>). Finally, the
normalized pupil area time-courses from rest 1 and 2 were temporally
concatenated for each subject, to match the concatenated rest fMRI scans. We
quantified eye-closure related missing pupillometry data by the proportion of
missing (zero-valued) time-points with respect to the total number of
time-points.</p>

        <p id="P11">T1-weighted anatomical images were skull-stripped using FSL opti-BET
(<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Lutkenhoff et al., 2014</xref>). All
further analyses were performed using <italic toggle="yes">BioImage Suite</italic> unless
otherwise specified (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2011</xref>).
Skull-stripped anatomical images were non-linearly registered to the standard
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Scheinost et al., 2017</xref>). Functional images were first
motion-corrected and realigned using twenty-four motion parameters (<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Satterthwaite et al., 2013</xref>), including six
rigid-body parameters, their temporal derivatives, and their quadratic terms,
using SPM8. Subject within scan head motion was quantified by computing the mean
FFD across each functional run. The first 10 s volumes were discarded to exclude
frames when eye-tracking system was initialized and stabilized. Functional
images were linearly registered to skull-stripped anatomical images using the
rigid transformation of the mean functional image from the first run (rest 1).
3D spatial smoothing was performed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a 4
mm full-width-half-maximum (<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Scheinost et al.,
2014</xref>). Nuisance covariates, including 1) 24 motion parameters, 2)
slow temporal drifts as modeled by the linear, quadratic, and cubic Legendre
polynomials, 3) the mean signals in the cerebrospinal fluid and white matter,
and 4) the whole-brain global signal, were regressed. Data were low-pass
filtered using a zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian filter with a cut-off
frequency of 0.12 Hz. For each run, using a 268-parcel functional atlas that
covered the whole brain excluding ventricles and white matter (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Finn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2013</xref>), we generated a time-by-node data matrix for each
individual by averaging the fMRI signals across voxels within each node.
Finally, two data matrices from rest 1 and 2 were temporally concatenated for
each subject, after normalizing the time-courses in each run to have zero mean
and unit variance.</p>
        <p id="P12">To evaluate the impact of global signal regression on our hub analyses,
we repeated the analyses on a time-by-268 node data matrix after preprocessing
data without the whole-brain global signal regression. In addition, to ensure
that our results were not specific to this atlas, we repeated our analyses using
a 249-parcel atlas, defined by integrating the Schaefer-200 cortex parcellation
(<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>), subcortical
structures from the anatomical Yale Brodmann Atlas (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Lacadie et al., 2008</xref>), cerebellum from <xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">Yeo et al. (2011)</xref>, and brainstem from the

area, to estimate arousal at each time-point. We stratify high and low arousal
states by selecting time-points from the top 20% (large) and bottom 20% (small)
pupil areas, resulting in 160 frames of fMRI data for each state. Using data
from either the high or low arousal state, we estimated resting state networks

similar number of sequential frames stratified as a single state to avoid any

        <p id="P15">SPARK uses a sparse dictionary learning algorithm such as K-SVD (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Aharon et al., 2006</xref>) to train a
subject-specific dictionary <italic toggle="yes"><bold>D</bold></italic> and the
corresponding <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-by-<italic toggle="yes">R</italic> sparse coefficient matrix
<italic toggle="yes"><bold>X</bold></italic>. For resting state fMRI data
<italic toggle="yes"><bold>Y</bold></italic>, a dictionary atom represents a temporal
feature (time-course) of a functional network and the corresponding row in
<italic toggle="yes"><bold>X</bold></italic> involves a spatial map. Taking advantage
of the ability of K-SVD to estimate a sparse code
<italic toggle="yes"><bold>x</bold></italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> for each node
with a small number (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>) of non-zero elements, a node involves a
node-specific overlap or combination of <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> (less than
<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>, therefore, sparse) networks among those
<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> networks in <italic toggle="yes"><bold>D</bold></italic>. The two
parameters, the total number of atoms in the dictionary or the whole-brain
network scale <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> and node-specific <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> values,
are automatically estimated using a minimum description criterion (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Using this framework,
<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness is a unique measure of between-network
integration and can serve to identify connector hubs, which are obtained by
counting the number of functional networks that overlap at each node.</p>
        <p id="P16">Another objective of SPARK is to achieve a single-subject-level
reliability in our estimation of connector hubs and resting state networks from
a short duration of fMRI data (e.g. 6-7 minutes). This is useful particularly
when a long data acquisition (e.g. &gt;30 minutes) is not appropriate (e.g.
scanning patients with epilepsy or pediatric participants). To do this, we
assess the reproducibility of sparse dictionary learning using a temporal block
bootstrap resampling, using a similar framework to the circular block bootstrap
(<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994</xref>). We
generate a large number of surrogate time-series drawn from the same probability
distribution of the original data and find network patterns consistently found
across surrogate datasets. See <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bellec et al.
(2010)</xref> for details on the theory and validation of using circular
block bootstrap in real fMRI network analyses.</p>
        <p id="P17">In this work, SPARK was applied for an individual fMRI data, a time
(<italic toggle="yes">T</italic>) by node (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>) matrix) as follows (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2</xref> for a summary
diagram). <bold>Step 1.</bold> We generated 300 surrogate datasets (each being a
<italic toggle="yes">T</italic> by <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> data matrix) from the original data
using a block bootstrap approach. The block bootstrap was performed with a block
length <italic toggle="yes">h</italic>. The choice of <italic toggle="yes">h</italic>, roughly the order
of <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6" display="inline"><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:math></inline-formula>, is suggested to preserve the temporal
dependencies in real fMRI signals during the resampling procedure (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bellec et al., 2010</xref>). Instead of using a
fixed value of <italic toggle="yes">h</italic>, we select a random integer <italic toggle="yes">h</italic>
between the square root of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M7" display="inline"><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:math></inline-formula>) and <inline-formula><mml:math id="M8" display="inline"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for each bootstrap sample, to include the
variability of SPARK results associated with <italic toggle="yes">h</italic> in our
reproducibility evaluation step (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bellec et al.,

<italic toggle="yes">R</italic> data matrix) are concatenated in time dimension to form a
<italic toggle="yes">T</italic> by <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> surrogate data matrix. The temporal
block falling at the end of time-series is trimmed to fit the desired
dimension.</p>
        <p id="P18"><bold>Step 2.</bold> For each resampled dataset, a sparse dictionary
learning algorithm (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Aharon et al., 2006</xref>;
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) was applied to learn a dictionary involving
<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> time-course atoms (temporal features) and a corresponding
sparse coefficient matrix (spatial maps). The algorithm involves an automatic
parameter estimation strategy using the minimum description length criteria
(<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). The total number
of networks (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>) was estimated independently for each resampled
dataset by varying <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> from 1 to the number of principal
components that explained 99% of the variance in each resampled dataset. The
level of sparsity (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>) was determined by varying
<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> from 1 to <italic toggle="yes">N/2</italic> for each
<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>. The reproducibility of parameters (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>
and <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>) of the sparse model were assessed across bootstraps.</p>
        <p id="P19"><bold>Step 3.</bold> After the 300 parallel processes, we collected 300
sparse coefficient matrices (each being a <italic toggle="yes">N’</italic> by
<italic toggle="yes">R</italic> matrix) and applied K-means spatial clustering. The
number of clusters (<italic toggle="yes">N’</italic>) was the median of estimated
<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> across 300 resampled datasets. The clustered spatial maps
(each generated from a row of sparse coefficient matrices) were averaged within
each cluster. Elements of the resultant average matrix <inline-formula><mml:math id="M9" display="inline"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">X</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> (a <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> by <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
matrix) are values representing both the weights (i.e. connectivity strength)
and the statistical reproducibility over bootstrap samples. They should exhibit
a large value if a node is consistently involved in a network across the 300
bootstrap samples. A small value in <inline-formula><mml:math id="M10" display="inline"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">X</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> indicates either that a node is not
consistently involved in a network or that the involvement of this node in a
network is consistently weak across bootstrap samples. Because we are only
interested in resting state networks that are consistently found in a single
subject, elements with a large value are selected by thresholding the average
matrix <inline-formula><mml:math id="M11" display="inline"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">X</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> at 95% confidence interval, approximating the

which each row represented a spatial map of individually reliable resting state
networks.</p>
        <p id="P20"><bold>Step 4</bold>. Counting the non-zeros for each column of this
matrix provided an estimation of <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness for each node. This
clustering procedure was repeated 100 times to take into account random
initializations in K-mean clustering. Finally, nodal <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness
was determined by the mean of <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness values estimated over
100 clustering results. The density of <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness was calculated
as the % proportion of nodes with non-zero <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness to the
total number of nodes estimated from data obtained in each arousal.</p>
        <p id="P21">For comparison purposes, we generate null data by randomizing the
assignment of pupillometry to fMRI across the 27 subjects (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). This results in 702 false fMRI-pupillometry
pairs, from which we stratify random high/low arousal assignments. Pupillometry
time-courses are unique to the individual (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig.
1d</xref>). The distribution of pupil time-course correlations is not skewed
(skewness= −.04) and not normal (Lilliefors’ test,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.003). See <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3</xref> for the individual
pupillometry time-courses. We compare our results to those from null data, in
order to test the null hypothesis that there is no association between resting
state functional connectivity and spontaneous arousal fluctuations defined using
pupillometry.</p>

        <title>Hub disruption index</title>
        <p id="P22">To assess the brain-wide connector hub reorganization with arousal, we

<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness from resting state fMRI at high and low arousal
states (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). The HDI was

(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Achard et al., 2012</xref>) and introduced
for <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness to study the reorganization of connector hubs in
patients with epilepsy (Lee et al., 2015). The HDI<sub>k</sub> is a summary
measure to quantify overall hub reorganization across the whole brain between a
brain state (e.g., high arousal) and another (e.g., low arousal) (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Achard et al., 2012</xref>). We measured the HDI<sub>k</sub>
at both the group and single subject levels. At the group level,
HDI<sub>&lt;k&gt;</sub> is the slope of the linear regression model
fit to group average <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness across subjects at high arousal
(<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>-axis, &lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;<sub>High</sub>)
and the difference in group average <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness between low and
high arousal (<italic toggle="yes">y</italic>-axis,
&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;<sub>Low</sub> -
&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;<sub>High</sub>) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). A negative slope means that some of the hubs
identified at high arousal lose their hub status at low arousal (i.e., nodes
exhibiting a high &lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;<sub>High</sub> relative to
&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;<sub>Low</sub> have a negative value of
&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;<sub>Low</sub> -

HDI<sub>&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;</sub> becomes zero when there
is no difference in <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness between the two states. The same
approach is used to define HDI<sub>k</sub> at the individual level, by using the

(<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>) in a single subject (<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>-axis,

evaluate if we can observe similar patterns of hub reorganization using the
hubness metrics derived using Graph theory. It is important to note that
<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness in SPARK and hubness metrics in Graph theory
measure different properties, therefore a direct comparison of these measures is
not appropriate. The Brain Connectivity toolbox (<ext-link xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/" ext-link-type="uri">https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/</ext-link>) was used to compute two
network measures for each node: within-module degree z-score and participant

For each time (<italic toggle="yes">T=160 time-points</italic>)-by-node
(<italic toggle="yes">R=268</italic>) data matrix, a <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>-by-R individual
connectivity matrix was obtained by computing the Pearson’s correlation
coefficient between the mean time-series signals in each pair of nodes. We
retained only positive correlations after replacing negative correlations by
zero and used a resultant weighted individual connectivity matrix to detect
modular network structures. We tested both binary and weighted undirected
networks. For binary undirected networks, edges with strong weights using a
proportional threshold were retained. Three proportional thresholds were tested:
5%, 10% and 30%.</p>

      <p id="P28">We present the results from our connector hub analyses across arousal levels
as follows. First, we assessed whether the global scale of functional connectivity
is preserved across high and low arousal states (<xref rid="S13" ref-type="sec">Section 3.1</xref>). We then estimated hub disruptions in the whole brain at
both the group and single subject levels (<xref rid="S14" ref-type="sec">Section

large-scale networks (<xref rid="S15" ref-type="sec">Section 3.3</xref>) and
inter-subject variability of the connector hub organizations (<xref rid="S16" ref-type="sec">Section 3.4</xref>). Then, we studied whether and how such
connector hub disruptions relate to the actual patterns of functional network
integration within these hubs (<xref rid="S17" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5</xref>).
The reliability and robustness of our hub estimations are addressed in <xref rid="S18" ref-type="sec">Section 3.6</xref>. Finally, we investigated the impact
of global signal regression on pair-wise fMRI signal correlations and the estimation
of hubs (<xref rid="S19" ref-type="sec">Section 3.7</xref>). In addition, we
evaluated whether traditional hub measures derived using graph theory could detect
arousal-level dependent changes in network integration and the impact of global

potential confounds introduced by the state stratification strategy in our

segments), we did not directly compare the distributions of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>
between high and low arousal states (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>). Instead, we compared the
between-state differences in <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> to the difference observed from

previous work (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Achard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Vatansever et al., 2020</xref>), we found that the

was preserved between states (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>).
Estimated <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> was 30 ± 16.3 (median ± interquartile
range) at high arousal and 25 ± 8 at low arousal. The goal is to
investigate whether the patterns of connector hubs actually change with arousal
modulations, while the global network scale is preserved during resting

        <p id="P30">We observed differences between the group average
<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness maps estimated from resting state fMRI at high and
low arousal states. At high arousal, connector hubs are widely distributed
across the unimodal and transmodal cortices, subcortical structures, cerebellum
and brainstem (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). At low arousal, we
observe an overall decrease in <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness across the brain,
relative to the high arousal state, with the exception of some nodes in the
visual networks (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">d</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">i</xref>,

        <p id="P31">To quantify the overall degree of hub disruptions in the whole brain, we
defined the hub disruption index (HDI<sub>k</sub> ) using <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>
-hubness (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). We found the
group-level HDI<sub>&lt;k&gt;</sub> to be −0.66, indicating a
brain-wide disruption of connector hubs with arousal at resting state (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). From the null data, the estimated
HDI<sub>&lt;k&gt;</sub> was 0.08, indicating no hub disruption
between randomly stratified states (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.

connection issue with the eye-tracking system and inability to quantify pupil

our findings using the mean of

<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness with arousal, again, in the frontoparietal (two-sided

default mode (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt;.01), motor, limbic and cerebellum

        <p id="P36">To quantify brain-wide changes in inter-subject variability between low

(−0.67), indicating a brain-wide decrease in inter-subject variability at
low relative to high arousal (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). For
null data, the slope was 0.02, which is close to zero, indicating no difference

        <title>Resting state networks at low arousal have reduced network overlaps and
increased global connectivity</title>
        <p id="P37">It is important to investigate how such connector hub disruptions relate
to the actual patterns of functional network integration within these hubs. For
each arousal state, we generated a probability map of functional connectivity
involving each hub, by computing the conditional probability
(<italic toggle="yes"><bold>p</bold></italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>) of each
node <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> to be a member of any functional network overlapping in
a hub <italic toggle="yes">j</italic> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). This
conditional probability was computed from the pooled collection of all networks
estimated from all individual subjects. The total number of hub-related (pooled)
overlapping networks was 32 ± 11 (median ± interquartile range
across the 268 nodes) at high arousal and 24 ± 11 at low arousal (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>; two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;2e-26). This indicates that there are fewer
network overlaps resulting in lower between-network integration at low arousal.
In addition, the spatial distribution of
<italic toggle="yes"><bold>p</bold></italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> varied
across hubs. For example (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>), for a
connector hub in the right ventral anterior cingulate cortex, the spatial
distribution of functional connectivity integrated with this hub was broader in
the low arousal, suggesting lower inter-subject variance at low relative to high
arousal. On the other hand, the probability map for a connector hub in the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex shows a similar spatial distribution of
hub-associated functional connectivity at both high and low arousal, including
regions of the frontoparietal and default mode networks, suggesting stable
inter-subject variability across arousal levels.</p>
        <p id="P38">Next, we quantified the total amount of functional connectivity of each
node <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> over the whole brain as the total hub connectivity
probability <italic toggle="yes"><bold>P</bold></italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). The median of
<italic toggle="yes"><bold>P</bold></italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>
distribution was higher at low arousal relative to high arousal (two-sided
Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;4e-29), suggesting an increase
in global hub connectivity. A scatter plot of the total hub connectivity
probability (<italic toggle="yes"><bold>P</bold></italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>) and
the group average <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness
(&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;) estimated for 268 nodes shows a clear
pattern of connector hub disruption: a decrease in <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness
and an increase in <italic toggle="yes"><bold>P</bold></italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>
from high to low arousal (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). In
addition, as expected, we found that nodes exhibiting large group-average
changes in &lt;k&gt; also exhibit large changes in inter-subject
variability (<bold>g</bold>) and total connectivity probability (<bold>h</bold>)
(r<sub>s</sub>: Spearman’s rank correlation,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0).</p>
        <p id="P39">Recall that the proposed total hub connectivity probability
(<bold><italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>) is

        <title>Reliability and robustness</title>
        <p id="P40">The reliability of hub estimations at the single subject level is
assessed using SPARK (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>),
to extract the most reproducible patterns of overlapping functional networks.
Within this procedure, we select highly reproducible components at 95%
confidence interval (CI) by approximating the Gaussian distribution of
background noise in network maps estimated from an average across 300
bootstraps. In this study, the density of <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness estimated
from data obtained in the high arousal state, for instance, decreases with
threshold: 0.84 ± 0.38 (median ± interquartile range) at 90% CI,
0.58 ± 0.41 at 95% CI, and 0.35 ± 0.29 at 99% CI (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7</xref>). This means only 35% of
nodes are reliably involved in at least one network, when using the most
conservative threshold. To validate whether our findings are robust to the
choice of CI, we repeated our analyses using 90% and 99% CI. As expected,
between-state changes in global network scale (Δ<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>,
low-high) were preserved across arousal states. Furthermore, we observed
decreases in the group-average <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness
(Δ&lt;k&gt;) and their inter-subject variability
(Δ<italic toggle="yes">σ<sub>k</sub></italic>) at low relative to high
arousal across all CI thresholds, with such changes being most robust in the
motor and cerebellum networks (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P41">To test if our results were replicable using different parcellation
schemes, we repeated all analyses using the 249-parcel functional atlas, defined
by integrating the Schaefer-200 cortex parcellation (<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>) with 49 subcortical regions.
Consistent with the results using the Shen-268 atlas, the number of networks
(<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>) were preserved across high and low arousal states
(Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&gt;.05). For this 249-parcel
atlas, we used ten pre-defined networks: 7 networks defined by Yeo-7 atlas
(visual, somatomotor, dorsal attention, salience ventral attention, limbic,
control, and default mode), and three anatomically defined subcortical networks
(subcortical, cerebellum, and brainstem). Within each of ten pre-defined
networks, we compared the distributions of
Δ&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;, by averaging
<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness in each node belonging to this network across 27
subjects, to the null Δ&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt; distribution
from the same nodes, by averaging <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness across 27
randomized data, repeated over 5,000 permutations. The result agreed with what
we found using SPARK, particularly the SPARK results with the most conservative
threshold (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8</xref>).
Group-average <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness was associated with decreased arousal
in the somatomotor (two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test, Bonferroni corrected
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.001), ventral attention (Bonferroni corrected
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.001) and subcortical network (Bonferroni
corrected <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.01). We also found increases in the
group-average <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness in the visual network at low relative
to high arousal (Bonferroni corrected <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.001). The total
number of hub-related (pooled) overlapping networks was 20 ± 9 (median
± interquartile range across the 249 nodes) at high arousal and 19
± 8.3 at low arousal (two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.03). This indicates that there are fewer network
overlaps resulting in lower between-network integration at low arousal. The
median of <italic toggle="yes"><bold>P</bold><sub>i</sub></italic> distribution was higher at
low arousal relative to high arousal (two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.004), suggesting an increase in global

group-average changes in &lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt; also exhibit large
changes in inter-subject variability (r<sub>s</sub>=0.75, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0)

        <title>Global signals</title>
        <p id="P42">It is suggested that the global signal in resting state fMRI is
associated with arousal fluctuations and the choice of global signal regression
may impact observed patterns of functional connectivity, introducing negative
correlations (<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Saad et al., 2012</xref>). The
global signal is composed of both neuronal and non-neuronal signals (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Fox, 2017</xref>). To assess the impact
of GSR on our hub analyses, we repeated all analyses using data preprocessed
without GSR and compared with our main results obtained from data preprocessed
with GSR. The shen-268 atlas was used for this assessment. The assessment was
conducted for (i) the analysis of pair-wise BOLD signal correlations, (ii) the
SPARK analysis of <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness, and (iii) the analysis of
conventional hub measures in Graph theory. As a result, we demonstrate a
systematic change in pair-wise fMRI signal correlation structures in the arousal
state-stratified data and the presence of global and local effects of arousal on
resting state functional connectivity. To this end, we show that the choice of
global signal regression could result in different conclusions in conventional
graph theoretical analysis and in the analysis of
<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness.</p>

          <title>Impact of GSR on BOLD signal correlations</title>
          <p id="P43">First, we compared the distribution of pair-wise BOLD signal
correlations in the datasets preprocessed with and without GSR. The standard
Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated between the BOLD
signals averaged in each pair of nodes. As expected, GSR introduced negative
correlations in both datasets acquired from the rest 1 and 2 runs (p=0,
two-sample t-test on Fisher’s Z transformed Pearson’s
correlation coefficients R), also from the datasets with temporal
concatenation of rest 1 and 2 (p=0). The shift in R distribution to
negative, after applying GSR, was observed from both datasets where the
arousal states were correctly or randomly identified (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>-<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">f</xref>).
When we did not perform GSR, there were more positive signal correlations at
high relative to low arousal (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>),
suggesting an inhomogeneous association of global signal across arousal
levels. The signal correlation distributions in datasets preprocessed using
GSR are not different between high and low arousal states (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref>). This result suggests that there is a
global arousal effect involved in the global signals and we may study local
effects (e.g. network hubs) of arousal modulations after applying GSR. Note
that our main results, the comparison of connector hub organizations across
arousal states, were obtained using the datasets preprocessed using GSR (the
n=27 datasets used in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref>), when
compared to the null datasets preprocessed using GSR (the n=702 datasets
used in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6j</xref>). We did not find
evidence to relate motion (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig-S4</xref>) or eye-closure related artifacts (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5</xref>) with our hubness
measures (individual level HDI<sub>k</sub> and the mean of
Δ&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;, <italic toggle="yes">low</italic> -
<italic toggle="yes">high</italic>) either with or without GSR. Note that GSR
resulted in the common impact on the two randomized datasets (false-high
arousal and false-low arousal states) introducing a shift toward negative
correlations (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">j</xref>). Together, we confirmed the well-known
impact of GSR on resting state functional connectivity and, in addition,
found an inhomogeneous association of global signals with pair-wise signal
correlations at high and low arousal.</p>

          <p id="P44">To understand how GSR impacts the estimation of arousal-level

our analyses using the same datasets preprocessed without GSR (the same
datasets used in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). As a result, we observed that GSR had
an impact on the hub estimation in resting state fMRI using SPARK (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P45">Like the results obtained with GSR (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), the global network scale estimated using SPARK was
preserved between high and low arousal (Wilcoxon rank sum test,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&gt;.05, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig.
7</xref>). The estimated total number of resting state networks
<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> was lower at both states when compared to the results
obtained with GSR: 21 ± 9.75 (median ± interquartile range) at
high arousal and 25 ± 6.25 at low arousal. We found a negative
HDI<sub>&lt;k&gt;</sub> at the group level
(HDI<sub>&lt;k&gt;</sub>=−0.84), when compared to the
null results by averaging nodal <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness across 27
randomized data over 5,000 permutations (left-tailed permutation test,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.008). When averaged across all 702 data
estimated using false fMRI-pupillometry pairs, the
HDI<sub>&lt;k&gt;</sub> was 0.03. The HDI<sub>k</sub> at the
individual level was −1.01 ± 0.17 and lower than those
estimated from individual null data (−0.97 ± 0.13; left-tailed
Wilcoxon rank sum test, p&lt;.05).</p>
          <p id="P46">Next, given that we previously observed that there were more
positive signal correlations at high relative to low arousal when GSR is not
applied (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>), we expected to
observe a difference in the impact of GSR on hubs between high and low
arousal states. As a result, when GSR was not applied, there was relatively
stronger reduction in &lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt; at high arousal
state compared to &lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt; values estimated at low
arousal state (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>), suggesting
that the organizations of overlapping networks at high arousal state is more
sensitive to the presence of global signals than those at low arousal state.
The strong reduction in &lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt; observed at high
arousal state in the data preprocessed without using GSR (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>) resulted in changes in our subsequent
analyses. We evaluated the distribution of arousal-level-dependent changes
in group-average <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness
(Δ&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;, <italic toggle="yes">low -
high</italic>) within each large-scale network (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Noble et al., 2017</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>, we found increases in
&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt; with decreased arousal in the visual
I (two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test, Bonferroni corrected
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.001), visual association
(<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.001), medial frontal

networks and decreases in &lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt; in the
brainstem (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.01). When we directly compare to the
distribution of Δ&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;,
<italic toggle="yes">low</italic> − <italic toggle="yes">high</italic>, estimated from data
preprocessed with and without GSR, we observe a shift of
Δ&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt; from negative to positive
values in all cortical networks (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig.
7f</xref>, two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test, Bonferroni corrected
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.001). The arousal level-dependent increases
in Δ&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;, <italic toggle="yes">low</italic> −
<italic toggle="yes">high</italic>, at the visual networks and decreases at the
brainstem network are observed in both datasets with and without GSR. On the
other hand, when GSR was not performed, the arousal level-dependent
decreases in Δ&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;, <italic toggle="yes">low

mode, motor, and limbic networks were then flipped to increases in
Δ&lt;<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>&gt;, <italic toggle="yes">low</italic>
− <italic toggle="yes">high,</italic> at low relative to high arousal.</p>
          <p id="P47">Lastly, we observed that global signals impact the actual patterns
of functional between-network integration within these hubs. The total

(median ± interquartile range across the 268 nodes) at high arousal
and 22 ± 9 at low arousal (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig.
7g</xref>; two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;2e-15). This indicates that there are more network
overlaps resulting in more between-network integration at low arousal, and
again, it is the opposite of what we found from the data preprocessed using

          <p id="P48">Lastly, we evaluated if the observed impact of GSR on the BOLD
signal correlation structures could be also observed in conventional hub
metrics derived using Graph theory from the same arousal state-stratified
datasets. Another goal was to investigate if hub metrics using Graph theory
could detect similar changes of network integration as the patterns of
network reorganization found using SPARK. To do this, group average
participant coefficients ⟨<italic toggle="yes">PC</italic>⟩ and
within-module degree z-score ⟨<italic toggle="yes">W</italic>⟩ were
computed for each node from the weighted undirected networks and the binary
undirected networks constructed using three proportional thresholds (30%,
10%, and 5%). Like the results found using SPARK, there were notable
differences in nodal participant coefficient between the data preprocessed
with and without GSR. On the other hand, we did not find between-state
differences in within-module degree z-score from both datasets with and
without GSR. In addition, patterns of between-state difference in
participant coefficients (low relative to high arousal states) were
different between when calculated from the weighted and binary undirected
networks, indicating that different analytic choices within Graph theory
also result in different conclusions.</p>
          <p id="P49">Specifically, we first compared the HDI of the graph measures
between the high and low arousal states. Using GSR, we did not find any
arousal-level dependent changes in the HDI estimated using either
within-module degree z-score or participant coefficient. Without using GSR,
there were hub disruptions estimated using within-module degree z-score
using the binary networks with 5% threshold, when compared to the results
from null data (5,000 permutations, left-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.05). The HDI using group average participant
coefficients showed arousal level dependent hub disruptions from the
weighted network and the binary networks using all thresholds
(<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;.01). Next, we compared the distribution of
between-state difference in nodal group average graph measures in the eleven
large-scale networks, estimated from the datasets with and without GSR. As a
result, we did not find any between-state difference in group average
within-module degree z-scores (Δ&lt;<italic toggle="yes">W</italic>&gt;,
<italic toggle="yes">low − high</italic>.) estimated from the binary
undirected networks using all proportional thresholds and from the weighted
undirected networks (5,000 permutations, two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test).
On the other hand, there were between-state differences in group average
participant coefficients (Δ&lt;<italic toggle="yes">PC</italic>&gt;,
<italic toggle="yes">low − high</italic>) within several networks, whereas
there was also clear discrepancy in these measures when estimated from
datasets with and without GSR (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).
See <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig.
S9</xref> for the results using the thresholds 10%
(<italic toggle="yes">PC</italic><sub>10%</sub>) and 5%
(<italic toggle="yes">PC</italic><sub>5%</sub>). The participant coefficients
estimated from the weighted and binary networks could result in different
patterns of arousal-level dependent changes in network integration. For
example, without using GSR, participant coefficients estimated from the
weighted network overall decreased at low relative to high arousal (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8e</xref>), however, those estimated from
the binary networks overall increased at low relative to high arousal (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8f</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P50">Overall, these results suggest that different choices of GSR can
result in different conclusions in the analyses of resting state functional
connectivity, and the impact of GSR varies depending on the choice of
network analysis methods. We found a systematic shift in pair-wise fMRI
signal correlations induced by GSR and reorganization of functional network
integration in arousal state-stratified datasets with and without GSR. The
observed changes in signal correlation structures in the arousal
state-stratified data and patterns of network integration suggest the
presence of global and local effects of arousal modulations on resting state
functional connectivity. That is, local effect of arousal on the functional
organization of the brain exists even after that global signal is removed by
GSR.</p>

level. K-hubness differences emerged in regions including the frontoparietal,
default mode, motor, limbic, and cerebellum networks. These findings establish a
relationship between modulations in arousal during resting wakefulness and the
dynamics of functional brain organization, including changes in connector hubs or
between-network integration. The inter-subject variability of connector hubs
decreases at low relative to high arousal, whereas the impact of arousal modulation
on connector hub-related functional network integration differed between brain
regions. State-dependent changes in connector hubs relate to the actual patterns of
network integration within these hubs. While the global network scale, the total
number of networks in the brain, was preserved between the high and low arousal
states, the number of hub-related networks decreased, and the nodal total
connectivity probability increased at low relative to high arousal state. These
findings together suggest a brain state transition from high to low arousal
characterized by global synchronization or reduced functional network
specializations. Control analyses indicated that motion and eye-closure related
effects are not driving results. Our results demonstrate that
<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness is sensitive to arousal levels within resting state and
that arousal is not localized to specific brain areas known to be directly
associated with arousal regulation, but instead it’s associated with changes
involving high-level between-network communications in the cerebral cortex.</p>
      <p id="P52">Secondly, our results suggest that different choice of GSR can result in
different conclusions in the analyses of resting state functional connectivity, and
the impact of GSR could vary over different analytic approaches. We first confirmed
the well-known shift of the pairwise fMRI signal correlation distribution to
negative, after applying GSR, regardless of whether the arousal states were
correctly or randomly identified. In addition, surprisingly, we found that when we
did not perform GSR, there was more positive signal correlations at high relative to
low arousal (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting an
inhomogeneous association of global signal across arousal levels. Furthermore, we
observed that patterns of network integration estimated using conventional Graph
theory and SPARK are different when estimated from data preprocessed with and
without GSR. Taken together, our result suggests the presence of global and local
effects of arousal modulations on resting state functional connectivity and
recommend in future studies on resting state functional connectivity to report
results using datasets preprocessed with and without GSR.</p>
      <p id="P53">These findings demonstrate the utility of simultaneous pupillometry as a
proxy for measuring variations in arousal during resting-state fMRI. In the absence
of task-related cognitive demands, pupil changes are mainly driven by non-specific
factors such as arousal (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Joshi and Gold,
2020</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Falahpour, 2020</xref>). We
observed brain-wide connector hub disruptions between low and high arousal, by
measuring the hub disruption index of group-average <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness
(HDI<sub>&lt;k&gt;</sub>) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).
This finding indicates the flexibility of functional networks over time even during
rest (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Barttfeld et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Shine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">Yeo
et al., 2015</xref>). The negative HDI<sub>&lt;k&gt;</sub> at the group
level was replicated using HDI<sub>k</sub> values estimated from individual
subjects. These results are in agreement with previous work using HDI for degree
centrality in graph theory, reporting hub disruptions in patients with coma (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Achard et al., 2012</xref>), and in healthy subjects
with propofol-induced sedation (<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Vatansever et al.,
2020</xref>). In this work, we were able to address a more subtle question as to
whether modulations in arousal during the resting state are associated with changes
in the functional organization of the brain. On the other hand, we found that the
HDI<sub><italic toggle="yes">k</italic></sub> estimated from the randomized state
datasets was higher at the individual level than that estimated at the group level,
potentially reflecting the presence of other factors (e.g., ongoing thought,
emotion) that could account for a portion of the inter-subject variation. Future
work should aim to identify such factors to understand the relationship between
these factors and hub configuration in the resting state.</p>
      <p id="P54">We found decreases in <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness at low relative to high
arousal in regions of the frontoparietal, default mode, motor, limbic and cerebellar
networks (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These regions have been
implicated in previous work that assessed co-fluctuations of resting state BOLD
activity and simultaneous pupillometry (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Breeden et
al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">DiNuzzo et al., 2019</xref>;
<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Yellin et al., 2015</xref>). Schneider et al. found a positive
coupling of pupil dilation with BOLD activity in the salience and default mode
networks, frontal and parietal areas, and a negative relationship between
spontaneous pupil constrictions and BOLD activity in the visual and sensorimotor
areas (<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>). Modulations
of the default mode network have been observed during sleep deprivation (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">De Havas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gujar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">Yeo
et al., 2015</xref>) and light sleep (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Boly et
al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Larson-Prior et al.,
2011</xref>; <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Spoormaker et al., 2010</xref>;
<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Sämann et al., 2011</xref>). We found a
between-state change in <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness in the node that spans from the
cerebellum to the locus coeruleus in the brainstem (Z= −24 in the MNI
coordinates)(<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Keren et al., 2009</xref>), a core
region of the ascending arousal system (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Dan,
2012</xref>), in agreement with Murphy et al. who found that pupil diameter
covaries with BOLD activity in the locus coeruleus (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we extend these previous studies by
demonstrating that modulations of arousal are not limited to specific brain areas
directly associated with the brain’s ascending arousal system, but instead
involve brain-wide communication networks.</p>
      <p id="P55">That we found arousal-level-dependent decreases in between-network
integration in regions of the frontoparietal cortex, suggests a role of arousal
modulations in baseline activity related to cognition. Decreases in functional
connectivity in the frontoparietal network were found during propofol-induced loss
of consciousness and sleep (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Boly et al., 2012</xref>;
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Boveroux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Schrouff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Schröter et al., 2012</xref>). Out finding that arousal modulation is
not limited to specific regions of the ascending arousal system, but rather involve
brain-wide cortical areas, agrees with other studies using different network
analysis approaches (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Falahpour,
2020</xref>). Using the analysis of coherence and phase-shift between fMRI and
arousal fluctuations, it is suggested that a traveling wave linked to arousal offers
a parsimonious account for the global organization of functional connectivity
gradients estimated from resting state fMRI (<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Raut et
al., 2021</xref>). Others found time-locked relationships between the
measurement of participant coefficient using graph theory, BOLD activity of the
ascending arousal system, low dimensional energy landscapes, and spatiotemporal
travelling waves (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Munn et al., 2021</xref>). Using
in-scanner pupillometry, <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Shine et al. (2016)</xref>
proposed that resting state functional connectivity alternates between integrated
and segregated network topologies, and demonstrated a positive relationship between
pupil diameter and between-network integration within these regions. On the other
hand, a set of regions in the visual cortex showed a positive relationship between
pupil diameter and within-network integration. Those findings in large part
harmonize with our work, particularly the results found using dataset preprocessed
using GSR, but there are several key differences. Notably, they identified
integrated or segregated “topological” states from data, while we
identified high or low “behavioral” arousal states. Our approach did
not take into account intermediate levels of arousal and potential transient
variations in hubs, but instead focused on detecting the most reproducible and
individually consistent hub features characterizing each arousal state. Together,
these findings lend support to the theory that state-dependent changes in brain
functional connectivity may be driven by ongoing alterations in ascending
neuro-modulatory input and global fluctuations in neural gain (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Eldar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Shine
et al., 2016</xref>). <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Shine et al. (2016)</xref>
reported consistent group-level results with and without GSR in their task fMRI
data, whereas the current work showed discrepancy between the two cases using
resting state fMRI data. It might be helpful in future work to study the impact of
GSR using an independent, larger dataset acquired from different sites and more
diverse population (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Marek et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P56">We found decreases in inter-subject variability of
<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness at low relative to high arousal (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The global network scale, the total number of
networks estimated in the whole brain, was preserved between the high and low
arousal states (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The number of
networks involving hubs was reduced in the low relative to high arousal state (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). The total functional connectivity
increased over the whole brain at low arousal, despite the reduced number of
hub-related networks, suggesting a brain state transition from high to low arousal
characterized by global synchronization or reduced functional network
specializations. In addition, the impact of arousal modulation on connector hubs
differed between brain regions (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This
suggests that accounting for arousal-dependent changes may help understand
individual variability in functional connectivity and its association with behavior.
Functional connectivity has been shown to be valuable in identifying individuals
using patterns of brain functional connectivity (i.e., fingerprinting)(<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Finn et al., 2015</xref>), and in predictive models
relating functional organization to behavior both under rest-(<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Finn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Shen
et al., 2017</xref>) and task-conditions (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Finn
et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al., 2018</xref>;
<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Task conditions offer a controlled manipulation of
brain state, in contrast to the unconstrained nature of resting state; therefore, it
is likely that individual differences in task-relevant circuitry can be amplified to
help predict related traits (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al.,
2018</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et al., 2000</xref>).
Functional connectivity estimated from higher arousal resting state may play a
different role in predicting traits, particularly for some phenotypes associated
with high-level functions. It has already been demonstrated that state manipulations
can influence trait predictions (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Finn et al.,
2017</xref>) for example. Given this evidence of the cognitive relevance of
resting state functional connectivity (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Barttfeld et
al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Castillo et al.,
2019</xref>) in developing predictive models of behavior, future work should
incorporate the role of arousal.</p>
      <p id="P57">Then, we confirmed the well-known impact of GSR on resting state functional
connectivity and observed that GSR had an impact on the estimations of network
integration using SPARK and Graph theory. We argue that the impact of GSR on the
relationship between arousal and resting state fMRI has been overlooked, and highly
recommend reporting results with and without using GSR when analyzing resting state
functional MRI data. GSR allows the study of arousal-level dependent changes in
brain network topology, removing a global arousal effect associated with the
fluctuations of pupil area. In this study, without performing GSR, we observed that
there were more positive signal correlations at high relative to low arousal,
whereas the signal correlation distributions in datasets preprocessed using GSR were
not different between two states (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).
Although, care is needed for its interpretation, because this result does not
indicate complete removal of common, global arousal fluctuations by GSR and
unintended effects are possible. As demonstrated in this work, using GSR may allow
us to study local effects of pupil-linked arousal modulations that remain after
global arousal effects included in the whole-brain mean signal are removed. Using
SPARK, we observed that hubs of overlapping networks estimated from high arousal
state data were more sensitive to the removal of global signals than hubs estimated
from low arousal state. However, this was not the case of the hubs of
non-overlapping networks estimated using Graph theory. Consistent with our earlier
work (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Garrison et al., 2015</xref>), the participant
coefficients estimated from different network constructions (e.g. weighted or
binary) showed different, i.e. reversed, patterns of arousal-level dependent changes
from the same datasets. It might be interesting in future studies to investigate why
removal of global signals affected hubs in one arousal state more than in another
and to explore at meso-scale the mechanisms underlying arousal-level dependent
changes in network integration.</p>
      <p id="P58">On the other hand, for the temporal alignment of pupillometry and fMRI
time-courses, our preprocessing strategies included the convolution with canonical
HRF, low-pass filtering, and down-sampling by averaging pupillometry data-points
within each 1 second bin to match with the fMRI sampling frequency, as suggested in
previous work (<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Shine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Yellin et al., 2015</xref>). While our results agree with
findings in these studies, future study would be necessary to better understand the
intra- and inter-subject variability of hemodynamic responses and whether the
assumed correspondence between pupillometry and fMRI signal is homogeneous across
multiple scales of time and space. In addition, note that there was a long interval
between two resting state runs, because we had several task fMRI runs (independent
from the purpose of this study) between them in the same session, without leaving
the scanner. This study design might have an additional effect on within-subject
variability in pupil area fluctuations (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3</xref>; e.g. ID 1560, ID 1913, ID
2106). Future investigation on the involvement of drowsiness, for example, combining
pupillometry/fMRI with EEG recordings, should clarify potential other sources of
within-subject variability in such pupil area fluctuations.</p>
      <p id="P59">It should be noted that data were processed identically in both the high and
low arousal states and in the null data set. Therefore, our observations cannot be
attributed to some methodological artifacts, such as dwell time difference. The fMRI
in the high and low arousal states, was balanced in terms of the amount of data
included. We did not take into account the potential impact of other potential
confounds, such as caffeine and alcohol consumption, anxiety levels and substance
use, but since we showed within-subject changes in arousal in the same imaging
session these are likely balanced within a run. We focused on comparing the highest
(top 20% largest pupil area) and lowest (bottom 20%) arousal states within each
subject by using the normalization of pupil area and the ranking of timeframes
within each subject. That was because our pre-analysis suggested a potential
relationship between the number of sequential time frames stratified as a single
state and the number of networks estimated using SPARK (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). We wanted to
ensure similar number of sequential frames stratified as a single state in our
between-state comparisons, therefore limited our analysis to these two states.
Future work could consider intermediate levels of arousal, inter-subject variability
in baseline arousal level and within-subject variability. Further work is needed to
understand fluctuations in arousal over longer periods of time (e.g., days, months)
and to relate these measurements to other quantifiable modalities (e.g., salivary
cortisol measurement (<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Page et al., 2009</xref>)). It
also may be interesting to explore if any specific arousal levels and their
associated hub disruptions at specific arousal levels help improve the performance
of connectome-based fingerprinting and predictive modeling of individual traits or
task performances. To compare arousal level-dependent brain network organizations
between resting state and naturalistic paradigms may help to understand why
naturalistic paradigms provides a better outcome in predicting behavior in some
studies (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Finn and Bandettini, 2021</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P60">In conclusion, using the simultaneous measurements of resting state fMRI and
pupillometry, we show evidence of a brain-wide decrease in between-network
integration and a decrease in inter-subject variability of connector hubs at low
relative to high arousal. Our results demonstrate that the estimation of
<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness using SPARK, which reflects the number of overlapping
networks for each node, is sensitive to the level of arousal within the resting
state. By studying connector hubs of hierarchical brain network organizations, we
suggest that modulations of arousal are not localized to specific brain areas, but
rather have a more extensive, brain-wide impact that involves high-level
communication between networks. Delineating arousal effects on functional
connectivity reconfigurations may help advance future studies on the brain-behavior
associations and neurological and psychiatric disorders where arousal may play a
role in clinical phenotypes.</p>

stratification for arousal level-dependent connector hub analysis. For each
subject, pupillometry data were used to stratify the simultaneously acquired
fMRI data into two states (high and low arousal). Specifically, time-points
where pupil area was within the top or bottom 20% rank were assigned to a high-
(orange) or low-arousal state (blue), respectively. A sparsity-based analysis of
reliable <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness (SPARK) was used to identify connector hubs
from state-stratified fMRI data, by measuring <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness for
each node at the individual level. (b) <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-hubness is defined as
the number of overlapping networks in each node. (c) Null data generation by
randomizing the assignment of pupillometry to fMRI across the 27 subjects. (d)
The distribution of Pearson’s correlation coefficients measured between

fMRI signal correlations across pupil-linked arousal states. (a and b) GSR
introduces negative correlations in resting state functional connectivity. For
each pair of nodes defined using the shen268 parcellation scheme, the
Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R) was calculated using the average
BOLD signals in each node from individual rest 1 (a) and rest 2 (b) data. Signal
correlations from all pairs of nodes across 27 subjects are then collected to
generate the distribution of R. (c–f) A shift of R distribution by GSR is
observed in true pairs of fMRI-pupillometry data (c and d, n=27) and across
randomized state datasets (e and f, n=702). In (c), the amount of shift induced
by GSR was larger in datasets stratified as high arousal state than in datasets
stratified as low arousal state. (g) Without using GSR, there are more positive
signal correlations at high relative to low arousal state. (h) In two randomized
state datasets, GSR introduces a common shift of the signal correlation
distributions toward negative correlations. (i) When GSR is applied, the signal
correlation distributions at the two arousal states overlap. (j) The same
