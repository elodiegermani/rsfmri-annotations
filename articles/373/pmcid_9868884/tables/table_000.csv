Analysis method,Definition
Functional connectivity (FC),FC is defined as statistical dependencies among remote neurophysiological events. (???)
FC density (FCD),Measure of the number of connections between a given voxel and all the other remaining brain voxels. (???)
Voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC),Measure of FC between each voxel and its symmetrical interhemispheric counterpart (voxel). (???)
Seed-based FC(also called region of interest (ROI)-based FC),Measure of FC between seed region(s) and the rest of the brain. (???)
Independent component analysis (ICA),"Multivariate data decomposition of spatially distributed BOLD signals into independent, temporally correlated functional components (networks) expressed as spatial maps with their corresponding time-series. (???) Several resting-state networks emerge from ICA analysis, e.g., the default mode network. (???)"
Stepwise FC (SFC),Measure of FC that characterizes the propagation and convergence of FC across brain networks. (???)
Graph analysis,"Analysis of brain networks by examining both the local and global connectivity of networks. (???, ???)"
Clustering coefficient,Describes the connectedness of the direct neighbors of the nodes and gives information on the formation of sub-graphs within the full network. (???)
Characteristic path length,Describes the average shortest path length between all pairs of nodes in the network and gives information on the global level of connectedness of a network. (???)
Degree,"Describes the number of connections of a node, helps identify highly connected nodes within a network. (???)"
Efficiency,"Global efficiency and local efficiency measure the network ability to transmit information at the global and local level, respectively. (???)"
Modularity,Describes the extent to which groups of nodes are connected to members of their own group and reflects the existence of subnetworks within the full network. (???)
Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF),Measure of the total power of BOLD signal within the low-frequency range of 0.01–0.08 Hz and is proportional to regional neural activity. (???)
Fractional ALFF (fALFF),ALFF-variant that measures power within the low-frequency range divided by total power in the entire detectable frequency range. (???)
Regional Homogeneity (ReHo),"Measure of similarity between BOLD time-series of a voxel and its nearest neighbors, calculated by Kendall coefficient of concordance of the time-series. (???, ???)"
