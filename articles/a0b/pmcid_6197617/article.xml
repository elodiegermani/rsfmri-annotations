          <title>Background</title>
          <p>There is paucity of neurobiological knowledge about major depressive disorder with psychotic features (“psychotic depression”). This study addresses this knowledge gap by using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) to compare functional connectivity in patients with psychotic depression and healthy controls.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We scanned patients who participated in a randomized controlled trial as well as healthy controls. All patients achieved remission from depressive and psychotic symptoms with sertraline and olanzapine. We employed Independent Component Analysis in independent samples to isolate the default mode network (DMN) and compared patients and controls.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Findings</title>
          <p>The Toronto sample included 28 patients (mean [SD], age 56·2 [13·7]) and 39 controls (age 55·1 [13·5]). The Replication sample included 29 patients (age 56·1 [17·7]) and 36 controls (age 48·3 [17·9]). Patients in the Toronto sample demonstrated decreased between-network functional connectivity between the DMN and bilateral insular, somatosensory/motor, and auditory cortices with peak activity in the right planum polare (t = 4·831; p = 0·001, Family Wise Error (FWE) corrected). A similar pattern of between-network functional connectivity was present in our Replication sample with peak activity in the right precentral gyrus (t = 4·144; p = 0·003, FWE corrected).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Interpretation</title>
          <p>Remission from psychotic depression is consistently associated with an absence of increased DMN-related functional connectivity and presence of decreased between-network functional connectivity. Future research will evaluate this abnormal DMN-related functional connectivity as a potential biomarker for treatment trajectories.</p>

          <title>Evidence before this study</title>
          <p id="p0010">Major depressive disorder (MDD) with psychotic features (“psychotic depression”) is a severe psychiatric disorder with global impact. Despite its severity, or perhaps because of it, psychotic depression is a psychiatric disorder that is rarely studied and little is known about its neurobiology. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) is a neurobiological probe that has identified patterns of functional connectivity implicated in depression and psychosis, including functional connectivity abnormalities related to the default mode network (DMN). To date, a single R-fMRI study has focussed on the hypothalamus specifically in unremitted patients with psychotic depression. Another R-fMRI study has examined the DMN in an aggregated sample of unremitted patients with non-psychotic and psychotic depression.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s0010">
          <title>Added value of this study</title>
          <p id="p0015">To our knowledge, this is the first R-fMRI study to specifically examine the DMN in psychotic depression while patients are remitted from their depressive and psychotic symptoms. The present study compared patients with psychotic depression, who were treated to remission with sertraline and olanzapine and subsequently scanned in the remitted state, to healthy controls. An absence of increased DMN-related functional connectivity (in patients relative to controls) and presence of decreased DMN functional connectivity with the bilateral insular, somatosensory/motor, and auditory cortices was found and replicated.</p>

        <sec id="s0015">
          <title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
          <p id="p0020">A consistent pattern of abnormal functional connectivity has been demonstrated between the subgenual cortex and DMN in non-psychotic depression, as well as in an aggregated sample that included patients with unremitted psychotic depression. The absence of such functional connectivity in remitted psychotic depression suggests that subgenual-DMN functional connectivity may be related to the state of psychotic depression; that remission may normalize such abnormal functional connectivity; and that the patterns of abnormal functional connectivity in this study may be related to the diagnosis of psychotic depression or to the process of remission. Importantly, these replicated patterns of abnormal DMN-related functional connectivity may serve as a biomarker for treatment trajectories.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="p0025">Unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) with psychotic features (“psychotic depression”) is a severe psychiatric disorder with global impact [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While depressive and psychotic symptoms can co-occur in other diagnoses such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar I disorder, the hallmark of psychotic depression is the emergence of psychosis during a major depressive episode and the recession of psychosis as the major depressive episode remits. This contrasts with diagnoses of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in which psychotic symptoms remain even after a major depressive episode remits, or bipolar I disorder, which is characterized by manic and depressive episodes with psychosis having the potential to emerge in either mood state [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Psychotic features have been found in 20% of patients with MDD [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and 45% of elderly inpatients with MDD [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Compared to MDD without psychotic features, MDD with psychotic features is associated with poorer outcomes, including longer recovery, greater disability, and increased mortality [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite its severity, or perhaps because of it, psychotic depression is a psychiatric disorder that is rarely studied and little is known about its neurobiology.</p>
      <p id="p0030">Two Studies of the Pharmacotherapy of Psychotic Depression (STOP-PD I and II) have been designed to improve the evidence-based treatment of psychotic depression. STOP-PD I, a 12-week randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, demonstrated the efficacy of combined sertraline and olanzapine in the acute treatment of psychotic depression [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The primary goal of STOP-PD II is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline plus olanzapine versus sertraline plus placebo in preventing relapse following remission from an episode of psychotic depression initially treated with a combination of sertraline and olanzapine. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) in STOP-PD II participants who had been treated to remission to identify biomarkers of psychotic depression since R-fMRI has been used to identify neural circuitry implicated in psychosis that changes with treatment response and may be the target of interventions [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We studied participants in remission to avoid confounds related to the state of depression or psychosis present in unremitted patients.</p>
      <p id="p0035">Studies of non-psychotic depression have demonstrated abnormalities within the default mode network (DMN) [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This network has been considered a “default” since the same regions show greater activity when no task is being performed. Yet there is evidence that the DMN is active during a range of self-referential functions, including planning for the future and remembering the past [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There are many resting state networks and the literature has examined how different resting state networks (as a whole or in parts and within or between networks) may be functionally connected in health or demonstrate functional connectivity abnormalities in disease [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>]. With reference to psychotic depression, functional connectivity abnormalities within the DMN have been identified in unremitted MDD [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The sole R-fMRI study on psychotic depression revealed abnormal functional connectivity between the hypothalamus and subgenual cortex, as well as other brain regions [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
      <p id="p0040">There is mounting evidence for DMN dysfunction in psychiatric disorders and changes in DMN functional connectivity in response to treatment have been demonstrated in non-psychotic depression [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, identification of abnormal functional connectivity within the DMN or between the DMN and other brain regions in remitted psychotic depression could serve as a biomarker of this disorder. The goal of the present study was to differentiate remitted psychotic depression from healthy controls. We hypothesized that remitted patients would have patterns of DMN-related functional connectivity that differ from healthy controls.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p id="p0045">The primary analysis was based on a sample of patients enrolled in STOP-PD II in Toronto. Twenty-eight patients with psychotic depression, recruited from the University Health Network (UHN) and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), and thirty-nine healthy controls were scanned on a 3 T GE Discovery MR750 at CAMH. Data collected on Siemens 3 T scanners at Cornell University/Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) (patients n = 16; controls n = 16) and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre (UPMC) (patients n = 13; controls n = 20) were analyzed to assess replicability of the findings with a sample size comparable to the Toronto sample.</p>
        <p id="p0050">The design of STOP-PD II, including eligibility criteria, has been described in detail [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, STOP-PD II participants were aged 18–85 years and met diagnostic criteria for non-bipolar MDD with psychotic features based on the Structured Clinical Interview for <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> Axis I Disorders administered by a trained research associate. STOP-PD II is divided into three consecutive phases: given the severity of psychotic depression, an acute phase of open-label treatment was pursued with higher doses of sertraline (target dose: 150 − 200 mg/day) and olanzapine (15–20 mg/day) lasting from four to twelve weeks to attain remission, an eight week stabilization phase to ensure that remission is sustained, and a 36 week randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the efficacy of sertraline plus olanzapine and sertraline plus placebo in preventing relapse of psychotic depression. At the end of the second phase, to be eligible for randomization into the RCT, participants must be in remission, defined as: [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] having been free of delusions and hallucinations for eight weeks; and [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] having a score of ≤10 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) for two consecutive weeks or a HAM-D score of 11–15 with ≥50% reduction of the acute phase baseline HAM-D score and a rating of “very much improved” or “much improved” on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale.</p>
        <p id="p0055">In line with the goal of the present study to differentiate remitted psychotic depression from healthy controls, all participants included in the analysis were scanned at the end of the second phase (i.e., before randomization, when they were in remission and taking sertraline and olanzapine). No data were available on patients receiving sertraline and olanzapine who fail to respond. Moreover, this study occurs prior to randomization and therefore there is no placebo group.

Functional scans were acquired using a spiral in/out gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2000 msec, TE = 30 msec, flip angle = 60°, matrix = 64 × 64, slice thickness = 5 mm, number of slices = 31. Resting state scan time was seven minutes. At Cornell/NKI, R-fMRI was acquired using an echo planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2000 msec, TE = 30 msec, flip angle = 80°, matrix = 96 × 96, slice thickness = 2·8 mm, number of slices = 34, with a scan time of seven minutes.

        <title>R-fMRI data analysis</title>
        <p id="p0070">The Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL 5·0·9) was used to preprocess and analyze R-fMRI data [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Standard individual preprocessing consisted of removal of the first three volumes to allow for steady-state signal equilibration, removal of temporal spikes using the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] 3ddespike, slice timing correction using AFNI 3dtshift (only for EPI acquisitions at Cornell/NKI and UPMC), head motion correction with AFNI 3dvolreg, brain extraction with the Brain Extraction Tool (BET), and a linear detrend. Timecourses were variance-normalized and single-session Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was performed on an automatically estimated number of ICs using Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC) version 3·14 [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These single session ICs were labelled as “signal” and “noise”. Noise ICs were regressed from the data using FMRIB's ICA-based Xnoiseifier (FIX) [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Given acquisition resolution differences between sites, AFNI 3dBlurToFWHM was then employed to iteratively smooth each participant's R-fMRI image to a final smoothness of 10 mm Full-Width-Half-Maximum. Data were realigned to the MNI template after cleaning with FIX. R-fMRI volumes were registered to individual structural scans using a normal linear search and subsequently spatially normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space (MNI152) using a nonlinear transform.</p>

        <p id="p0075">Rigorous detection and correction of motion artefacts is important for mitigating site effects [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Mean frame displacement was included in primary statistical analyses, however to further address motion artefact and physiological sources of noise (such as respiration and cardiac effects which were not measured independently) we employed FIX. For the purpose of data cleaning with FIX, individual signal and noise classifiers were trained for each scanning site using a pseudorandom subset of participants (Toronto: twelve patients, twelve controls; Cornell/NKI, ten patients, ten controls; UPMC, nine patients, nine controls). To facilitate this process, ICs from the training set were first labelled as signal (i.e., a resting state network) or noise (i.e., motion or scanner artefacts, non-neuronal physiology, and other nuisance signals) by FIX using the standard training set available with the FIX package. These labels were manually inspected and readjusted with the aid of an in-house html qc interface (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/edickie/icarus" id="ir0005">https://github.com/edickie/icarus</ext-link>). Readjusted labels were then submitted to FIX for classifier training. Site-specific training data was then used to classify all ICs from all participants at each site. Noise components were regressed out of the original data.</p>

        <title>Group ICA and dual regression</title>
        <p id="p0080">For the Toronto sample collected on a 3 T GE scanner, cleaned data for each participant were temporally concatenated across participants, creating a single 4D dataset for group-wise ICA. The number of ICs was automatically determined to be 42 using standard FSL techniques [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The DMN IC included peak activation in the posterior cingulate, bilateral parietal, and medial prefrontal cortices and did not mask out non-default mode regions. This IC was identified among the 42 ICs by visual inspection and spatial correlation against a previously well-defined default mode map [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The IC most correlated with this canonical DMN map (r = 0·65) had substantially higher spatial correlation than the next best fitting IC (r = 0·35). The same procedure was followed for the Cornell/NKI and UPMC data. Since these data were collected on 3 T Siemens scanners, data were combined to achieve power comparable to the Toronto sample. Using standard FSL techniques [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the DMN was identified among 14 ICs that were automatically isolated and the IC most correlated with the canonical DMN map (r = 0·81) had substantially higher spatial correlation than the next best fitting IC (r = 0·10).</p>
        <p id="p0085">Dual regression was then employed for voxel-wise comparisons of functional connectivity between patients and controls [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This approach proceeded in three stages. First, for each participant, the group-average DMN were spatially regressed into the participant's 4D space-time dataset. This resulted in a set of participant-specific timeseries representing the DMN timeseries. Second, these participant-specific DMN timeseries were temporally regressed into the same 4D dataset, resulting in a set of participant-specific DMN functional connectivity maps based on the synchronicity between the timeseries and any given voxel. Third, group differences were then tested using FSL's <italic>randomise</italic> permutation-testing tool (10,000 permutations). Group comparisons employed threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) and were family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons across the brain at p &lt; 0·05 [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>

Similarly, the conjunction of the Toronto and Replication sample dual regression result maps (thresholded at p &lt; 0·01) was obtained to form an unbiased dual regression result search space.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="p0135">The main finding of this study is that patients with remitted psychotic depression differ from healthy controls in terms of decreased DMN-related between-network functional connectivity implicating interoceptive and exteroceptive brain regions. A similar pattern of decreased DMN-related functional connectivity was observed in a Replication sample. ROI analyses corroborated these results. Exploratory analyses in the Replication sample suggested an effect of sertraline and olanzapine dose on within-DMN functional connectivity when modeled separately. However, this effect was not significant in the Toronto sample nor in either sample when both sertraline and olanzapine were modeled.</p>
      <p id="p0140">Our findings suggest a pattern of abnormal functional connectivity between the DMN and other key brain regions that may be relevant to remission in psychotic depression. This functional connectivity may be a biomarker of psychotic depression that endures into remission or representative of active neural processes of remission itself. Perhaps the most well known example of between-network relationships relates to the activation and deactivation of different networks during cognition [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Such between-network relationships have been examined in depression [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Many disorders have demonstrated DMN-related functional connectivity abnormalities, yet it has been noted that there may exist unique abnormalities for specific disorders [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It should also be noted that the interoceptive and exteroceptive regions found in this study have been implicated in other neural circuits. Previous studies have examined the role of the bilateral insula and somatosensory/motor cortices and how they may support the mental experience of bodily states that accompany emotions, i.e., “feelings” [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, lesion studies provide evidence that the insula and somatosensory cortices are necessary but not sufficient for the emergence of feelings [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our results extend this work and suggest that the neural circuits that have been implicated in feelings have functional connectivity with the DMN and that a disorder such as psychotic depression impacts this functional connectivity. Another possibility relates to a recent quantitative MRI study that suggests insular and somatosensory cortices are responsible for processing trait behaviours associated with empathy [<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our study does not permit the exploration of whether the observed functional connectivity patterns specifically relate to processing feelings or empathy. However, the observation remains that DMN-related functional connectivity with interoceptive and exteroceptive brain regions are abnormal in psychotic depression and that this observation replicates in an independent sample.</p>
      <p id="p0145">To our knowledge, these findings are the first functional MRI-based neural correlates of remitted psychotic depression. This is also the first study to specifically examine the DMN in psychotic depression. Within and between-network abnormalities in patients with non-psychotic depression have been reviewed and abnormal connectivity between the subgenual cortex and DMN has been the most consistent pattern of functional connectivity [<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is possible that remission was associated with normalization of functional connectivity between the subgenual cortex and the DMN in our patient participants. DMN-related functional connectivity has been previously examined in healthy controls compared to an unremitted sample that aggregated MDD patients with (n = 11) and without (n = 17) psychotic features and revealed increased functional connectivity with the subgenual cingulate, medial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex, and precuneus [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our findings contrast with this unremitted sample and are notable for the absence of increased/decreased within-DMN functional connectivity. Our findings are consistent with earlier research showing between-network abnormalities in patients with unremitted psychotic depression, reflected in those investigations by decreased functional connectivity between the hypothalamus and subgenual cingulate [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the subgenual cingulate, inferior frontal cortex, and insula [<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Nonetheless, the pattern of between-network abnormalities in these unremitted patients differs from our patients with remitted psychotic depression.</p>
      <p id="p0150">There are several limitations of this study. To begin with study design and medication related limiations, the inclusion of a non-psychotic depression group would have added information related to the specificity of our findings to psychotic depression and would have potentially permitted a direct comparison of effects of antidepressant medication on functional connectivity to that of the combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication on functional connectivity. We note, however, that the STOP-PD II RCT did not collect such data and highlight that it remains a unique sample in which all patients remitted on the same antidepressant and antipsychotic medications. Another limitation of this study relates to the general effects of medication use on functional connectivity. While the present cross-sectional study compares medicated patients and healthy controls and does not permit an in-depth exploration of such effects, it is noteworthy that our exploratory medication analysis that combined sertraline and olanzapine did not result in any significant effect of sertraline or olanzapine dose on functional connectivity. Future longitudinal analyses will explore this issue in greater detail. An additional limitation of our cross-sectional study is that we cannot assess whether the DMN-related functional connectivity we observed in patients with psychotic depression predict longer-term remission or relapse. This limitation will be addressed when follow-up scans are obtained, offering the unique opportunity to compare functional connectivity in patients who were randomized to receive sertraline and placebo to those randomized to receive sertraline and olanzapine. It will further offer the opportunity to compare functional connectivity in patients who maintain remission to those who relapse.</p>
      <p id="p0155">Ongoing debate remains on whether to use an eyes closed versus eyes open versus fixated condition when collecting R-fMRI data [<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>]. For example, variable reliability and higher functional connectivity in the auditory network has been described with an eyes closed condition [<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although these effects were statistically significant, it should be noted that this study also found the effect size of differences in reliability and consistency of the eyes open, eyes closed, and fixation conditions to be small. Our post-hoc analyses suggest, however, that patients with remitted psychotic depression (relative to healthy controls) have replicable patterns of within and between-network functional connectivity (implicating the auditory network and others) that are evident despite the possibility of the eyes closed condition influencing functional connectivity.</p>
      <p id="p0160">Our study is also potentially limited by its sample size. However, a single R-fMRI [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] study and two task-based fMRI [<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] studies had a comparable or smaller number of patients with psychotic depression. Nevertheless, the small sample size may have contributed to some inconsistent functional connectivity findings. Despite small sample sizes and varying acquisition parameters, we replicated our findings related to abnormal insular/somatosensory/motor/auditory functional connectivity.</p>
      <p id="p0165">In summary, in a multi-centre study of patients with remitted psychotic depression, we identified abnormal DMN-related functional connectivity, particularly between interoceptive and exteroceptive brain regions and the DMN. When compared to healthy controls, remission from psychotic depression was consistently associated with significantly decreased functional connectivity with these brain regions. Future research will evaluate this abnormal DMN-related functional connectivity as a potential biomarker for treatment trajectories.</p>
