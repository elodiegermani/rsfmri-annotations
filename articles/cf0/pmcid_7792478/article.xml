        <title>SUMMARY</title>
        <p id="P3">Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used in cognitive and clinical neuroscience, but long-duration scans are currently needed to reliably characterize individual differences in functional connectivity (FC) and brain network topology. In this report, we demonstrate that multi-echo fMRI can improve the reliability of FC-based measurements. In four densely sampled individual humans, just 10 min of multi-echo data yielded better test-retest reliability than 30 min of single-echo data in independent datasets. This effect is pronounced in clinically important brain regions, including the subgenual cingulate, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, and is linked to three biophysical signal mechanisms (thermal noise, regional variability in the rate of T<sub>2</sub>* decay, and S<sub>0</sub>-dependent artifacts) with spatially distinct influences. Together, these findings establish the potential utility of multi-echo fMRI for rapid precision mapping using experimentally and clinically tractable scan times and will facilitate longitudinal neuroimaging of clinical populations.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p id="P6">The human brain is organized into functional networks that can be mapped non-invasively using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) (<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">Snyder and Raichle, 2012</xref>), a technique that has evolved rapidly to become one of the most commonly used tools in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Pioneering studies have used rsfMRI to reveal the topology of functional brain networks (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Biswal et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R101" ref-type="bibr">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>), and their associations with discrete cognitive processes and behaviors (<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Studies have also begun to define alterations within brain networks that are associated with psychosis (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Anticevic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Karcher et al., 2019</xref>), depression (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Downar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Drysdale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Oathes et al., 2015</xref>), autism (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Di Martino et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Hull et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Padmanabhan et al., 2017</xref>), and other neuropsychiatric disease states (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Castellanos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Menon, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2018</xref>). Promising clinical applications for rsfMRI (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Fox and Greicius, 2010</xref>) include pre-operative mapping (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Sair et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">Yahyavi-Firouz-Abadi et al., 2017</xref>), providing diagnostic and prognostic information (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Drysdale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Dunlop et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2012</xref>), and mapping targets for neuromodulation therapies (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">McMullen, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Medaglia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">Weigand et al., 2018</xref>). However, there are several obstacles to realizing its full clinical potential.</p>
      <p id="P7">First, in the majority of rsfMRI studies, data acquired from many individuals are co-registered in a common atlas space, and functional brain networks and their relationships with clinical or behavioral variables are analyzed at the group level. But recent evidence indicates that this approach can obscure individual differences in the topology (size, shape, and spatial arrangement) of functional areas and networks in cortex (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017c</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2015</xref>), in the cerebellum (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Marek et al., 2018</xref>), and in subcortex (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al., 2020</xref>), variability that could be both functionally meaningful and clinically useful (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">Seitzman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Efforts to develop neuroimaging tools for diagnosing neuropsychiatric disorders or predicting treatment response could benefit by accounting for these individual differences.</p>
      <p id="P8">Second, resting-state functional connectivity (FC) measurements would ideally exhibit high reliability at the level of individual subjects (i.e., they would be similar across repeated assessments), especially in certain clinical contexts. However, obtaining reliable FC-based measurements throughout the brain at the individual subject level typically requires large amounts of per-subject rsfMRI data (on average, 45 min in cortex [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017c</xref>] and more than 90 min in the cerebellum and subcortex [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Marek et al., 2018</xref>]), a practice referred to as “dense sampling” (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Poldrack, 2017</xref>) or “precision functional mapping” (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017c</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Gratton et al., 2020</xref>). It is thought that artifactual within-subject variation in FC is due primarily to two factors: (1) random sampling error (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Noble et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), in part because FC reflects low-frequency fluctuations in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may require long duration scans to assess accurately; and (2) the confounding influence of non-neurobiological artifacts, including those related to head motion (<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Satterthwaite et al., 2012</xref>), and participant drowsiness (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Tagliazucchi and Laufs, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, long-duration scans may improve reliability by reducing sampling variability, but they also require that the subject remain still, awake, and alert throughout, which is a significant obstacle in both research and clinical populations that may not tolerate long (or multiple) scans. Low test-retest reliability may be less of a problem for some study designs, including those aimed at identifying effects at the group level in large samples. In contrast, low test-retest reliability is a fundamental obstacle to progress in other contexts, including intervention studies involving scans obtained before and after a treatment, biomarker discovery efforts, analyses of individual differences, and studying network plasticity at the individual level. Thus, there is a pressing need for techniques that can yield more reliable FC-based measurements from experimentally and clinically tractable scan times, as explained by recent commentaries on this topic (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">D’Esposito, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Lynch and Liston, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Satterthwaite et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P9">Here, we tested whether multi-echo (ME) fMRI could enable more rapid and reliable mapping of functional brain networks in individuals, ameliorating the need for long scans. ME fMRI sequences (<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Posse, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Posse et al., 1999</xref>) acquire multiple images at different echo times (i.e., at repeated intervals over tens of milliseconds) per volume, in contrast to standard single-echo (SE) sequences, which acquire a single image in the same period of time. Studies have previously demonstrated that ME fMRI increases BOLD signal sensitivity (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bhavsar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Posse et al., 1999</xref>) and can be used to identify and discard fMRI signals that cannot have originated from neurobiological activity (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Kundu et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2018</xref>). On first principles, either of these capabilities could enhance the reliability of FC at the individual subject level, but this possibility has not been tested directly.</p>
      <p id="P10">To test this hypothesis, we acquired 6 h (24 × 14.5-min scans) of ME rsfMRI data from two adult participants over 9 months. We found that the reliability of FC measurements was enhanced nearly brain-wide in ME fMRI data, even when using limited amounts of per-subject data, compared to parallel analysis of SE data from the same participants and 14 densely sampled individuals from three SE datasets (n = 10 from the Midnight Scan Club [MSC] [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017c</xref>]; n = 3 from the Cast-induced Plasticity [CAST] study [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Newbold et al., 2020</xref>]; n = 1 from the MyConnectome [MC] project [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Poldrack et al., 2015</xref>]). This effect was linked to at least three biophysical signal mechanisms with spatially distinct influences and replicated in two other less densely sampled participants.</p>

        <title>Benchmarking the Reliability of FC Estimates in Three Independent SE Datasets</title>
        <p id="P11">To begin, we quantified the reliability of FC at each point in the brains of 14 individuals from three independent datasets that were repeatedly scanned using SE sequences (MSC [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017c</xref>]: n = 10; 10 × 30-min scans acquired over 2 months; CAST [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Newbold et al., 2020</xref>]: n = 3; 10 to 14 × 30-min scans acquired over consecutive days prior to casting of their upper right extremity; MC [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Poldrack et al., 2015</xref>]: n = 1; 84 × 10-min scans acquired over 18 months). A summary of the sequence parameters used to collect these datasets is provided in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>. The purpose of this first analysis was to obtain an independent benchmark against which our ME fMRI datasets could be evaluated.</p>
        <p id="P12">We generated FC reliability maps for each subject using different amounts of data (ranging from 1 min to the full duration of scans in each dataset). In short, these maps index (using spatial correlation) how similar the FC of each point in the brain is when calculated using the specified amount of data from a single scan versus a large amount of independent data from the same participant. Values approaching 1 indicate better reliability. Reliability maps for example subjects from the MSC (MSC01 and MSC06 in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), CAST (CAST01 in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), and MC (MC01 in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) datasets are shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. The two participants from the MSC dataset shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> were selected randomly and are ranked second (MSC06) and fourth (MSC01) of the n = 10 with respect to their average brain-wide reliability value. The FC reliability maps for all 14 subjects can be viewed in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video S1</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P13">This analysis yielded two results. First, reliability increased with scan duration, which is consistent with findings from other studies (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Birn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017c</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2015</xref>), but relatively few points in the brain exhibited highly reliable FC. On average, only 28% (range: 0%–59%) of cortex exhibited high reliability (&gt;0.7) in MSC and CAST subjects, even when using the full 30-min scan. Second, the rate that FC became reliable varied by brain region (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). For example, FC was fairly reliable (&gt;0.5) in lateral prefrontal, parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and other association areas with only 5–10 min of data. Other regions, including subcortical structures (basal ganglia, thalamus); the cerebellum; and somatomotor, inferior temporal, and subgenual cingulate cortex, exhibited relatively low reliability (&lt;0.5) on average, even with 30 min of data. This finding is consistent with recent reports that more than 1 h of per-subject data may be necessary to obtain reliable FC estimates in subcortex (basal ganglia and thalamus; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al., 2020</xref>) and in the cerebellum (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Marek et al., 2018</xref>). We note that the brain regions exhibiting relatively low reliability—including the cerebellum (<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Schmahmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">Stoodley et al., 2016</xref>), subgenual cingulate (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Mayberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Pizzagalli, 2014</xref>), and basal ganglia (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Dandekar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Morishita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Perlmutter and Mink, 2006</xref>)—are implicated in psychiatry and neurology, which underscores the potential impact of tools for enhancing the reliability of FC in these areas. In summary, this first analysis replicates previous reports of scan length influencing the reliability of FC, but it also highlights how FC reliability varies significantly by brain region, which has been reported elsewhere as well (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Noble et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p>

        <title>ME fMRI Improves BOLD Signal Sensitivity and Enables the Removal of Non-BOLD Artifacts</title>
        <p id="P14">To test if ME fMRI could be used to obtain more reliable individual-specific FC-based measurements, we first acquired 6 h of ME fMRI data (24 × 14.5-min scans) from two individuals (referred to here as ME01 and ME02) over a period of 9 months.</p>
        <p id="P15">In a SE fMRI sequence, like those used to collect the three independent datasets analyzed in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, images are acquired once per tissue excitation after a single fixed delay (“echo time”; usually 30–35 ms). A ME fMRI sequence acquires multiple images at different echo times spanning dozens of milliseconds, which affords two advantages. Below, we characterize these two advantages (readers are encouraged to see a review by <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Kundu et al. [2017</xref>] for a more complete discussion) before demonstrating how they additively enhance the reliability of FC and brain network topologies in the following sections.</p>
        <p id="P16">The first advantage of ME fMRI is that images acquired at different echo times can be combined according to the rate of T<sub>2</sub>* decay at each voxel to create an “optimally combined” ME (OC-ME) time series (<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Posse et al., 1999</xref>). This is useful because BOLD contrast is optimal near the T<sub>2</sub>* of each voxel, and combining echoes in this manner can recover signal in brain regions with a short or long T<sub>2</sub>* compared to a single fixed echo. This effect is localized to specific brain regions. Consider, as an example, the subgenual cingulate (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; purple), which has a short T<sub>2</sub>* (&lt;20 ms in both ME01 and ME02; see T<sub>2</sub>* maps in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) and exhibited relatively low reliability in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>: in the OC-ME image, earlier echoes are weighted more heavily than later echoes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), which helps recover signal that would have otherwise been lost. Other brain regions, including portions of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, have a short T<sub>2</sub>* as well (see <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Combining echoes also dampens thermal (random) noise (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Liu, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Poser and Norris, 2009</xref>), which can be a large fraction of the recorded signal (<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Power, 2017</xref>). Because thermal noise is embedded in all fMRI signals, this effect will occur throughout the brain.</p>
        <p id="P17">To demonstrate the effect that combining echoes has on FC, we generated FC maps using brain regions with relatively short (subgenual cingulate; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) and long (lateral prefrontal cortex [PFC]; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) T<sub>2</sub>* values as seeds. For both subjects ME01 and ME02, maps were first created using OC-ME data from a single representative ME scan denoised using an extensively validated and commonly used algorithm for cleaning SE fMRI data (ICA-AROMA; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Ciric et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Pruim et al., 2015</xref>). For comparison, the same maps were created using the second echo (TE<sub>2</sub>) of the ME scan and a separate connectome-style (faster sampling rate; TR = 800 ms versus TR = 1355 ms) SE acquisition, both of which were preprocessed and denoised in the same fashion as the OC-ME data. Two observations are notable. First, the seed placed in the short T<sub>2</sub>* subgenual cingulate exhibited stronger FC, with default mode network brain regions in OC-ME data, whereas this pattern of FC was absent in the TE<sub>2</sub> and fast-TR SE comparison datasets (see dashed white circles in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> indicating weaker FC with the posterior cingulate). Second, as expected, differences among the OC-ME, TE<sub>2</sub>, and SE datasets were less pronounced for the seed in lateral PFC (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), which has a longer T<sub>2</sub>* value and thus is less susceptible to signal dropout, but FC maps still appeared as if they were superimposed on static (thermal) noise. Collectively, this analysis demonstrates how ME fMRI improves BOLD signal sensitivity—particularly for short T<sub>2</sub>* brain regions—by accounting for regional differences in the rate T<sub>2</sub>* decay (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Bandettini et al., 1994</xref>) and dampening thermal noise.</p>
        <p id="P18">The second advantage of ME fMRI is that how signals decay across echoes can be used during denoising to identify and remove signals that cannot have originated from neurobiological activity, including those related to head motion, heating or instability of MRI hardware, and cerebrovascular pulsatility (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Kundu et al., 2017</xref>). Discarding these kinds of artifacts is desirable, in part because they can produce spurious FC estimates (<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), but difficult to do in SE datasets because there is no ground truth for determining if a signal is indeed artifactual. ME fMRI provides this ground truth. For example, spatially structured signals in the OC-ME time series identified from a spatial ICA can be classified as neurobiological (and retained) or non-neurobiological (and discarded) on the basis of their signal-decay properties, an approach called ME-ICA (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Kundu et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we confirmed that ME-ICA can be used to separate neurobiological and non-neurobiological signals using an instructed deep breathing task (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref> for the rationale behind using the event-related approach described in <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">Power et al. [2020</xref>] to establish appropriate signal separation).</p>
        <p id="P19">In summary, we reasoned that ME fMRI has the potential to improve the reliability of FC by at least two mechanisms: (1) by enhancing BOLD signal sensitivity through the weighted combination of echoes and (2) by removing non-neurobiological artifacts through a signal-decay-based denoising technique called ME-ICA.</p>

        <title>Brain-wide Improvements in Connectivity Reliability in ME fMRI Data</title>
        <p id="P20">Next, we evaluated the reliability of FC derived from OC-ME (<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Posse et al., 1999</xref>) data denoised using ME-ICA (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Kundu et al., 2012</xref>) in ME01 and ME02, leveraging both advantages of ME fMRI detailed in the previous section. Reliability maps were created in the same way as was done for <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Consistent with our hypothesis, OC-ME data denoised using ME-ICA (OC-ME + ME-ICA) yielded reliable FC at nearly every point in the brain (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; top row). Over 75% of cortex exhibited high (&gt;0.7) reliability (82% in ME01 and 75% in ME02), compared to, on average, 28% (range: 0%–59%) in independent SE participants with twice as much data. Time × reliability curves (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) show the average reliability value (calculated separately in cortex, subcortical structures, and cerebellum) given different scan durations. Scan duration is calculated before removal of high motion volumes. Curves from the three independent SE datasets are shown as comparators. Plotting reliability values relative to the amount of data retained after motion-censoring yielded a set of similar curves (with the exception of MSC participants exhibiting especially high levels of head motion; e.g., sub-MSC08) that can be viewed in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P21">One-sample t tests revealed that 10 min of OC-ME + ME-ICA data yielded FC estimates that were more reliable than those derived from 3 times as much independent SE data in cortex (<italic>t</italic>(12) = 5.52, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.46), in the cerebellum (<italic>t</italic>(12) = 4.89, p = 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.38), and in subcortical structures (<italic>t</italic>(13) = 5.30, p = 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.10). These findings, which were replicated in two other less densely sampled individuals (“ME03” and “ME04”; see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>), indicate that FC reliability can be enhanced in OC-ME data when signal-decay-based denoising is used.</p>
        <p id="P22">To better understand the unique contributions of the OC-ME procedure and signal-decay-based denoising (ME-ICA) to the enhanced reliability of FC observed in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, we created reliability maps for OC-ME and TE<sub>2</sub> data denoised using ICA-AROMA (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Ciric et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Pruim et al., 2015</xref>), which, unlike ME-ICA, does not leverage any signal-decay information. Two findings are notable. First, reliability was enhanced in OC-ME data denoised with ME-ICA, compared to ICA-AROMA, particularly in the cerebellum and basal ganglia (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; top row versus middle row). One interpretation is that either the high density of vasculature (<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">Vigneau-Roy et al., 2014</xref>) or close proximity to ventricles (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds, 2017</xref>) renders these areas more susceptible to certain kinds of physiological artifacts (e.g., those related to cardiac pulsation) that are discarded by ME-ICA, but not ICA-AROMA. Second, the FC reliability maps (bottom row in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and time × reliability curves associated with TE<sub>2</sub> + ICA-AROMA data were similar to those in the three independent SE datasets (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Reliability maps for all study participants can be viewed in <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video S2</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P23">A limitation of using TE<sub>2</sub> as a stand-in for SE data is that contemporary SE sequences can acquire images at faster rates than ME sequences. To help address this concern, ME01 underwent 6 h of additional scanning (24 × 14.5-min scans) with a fast-TR (800 ms) SE sequence. Direct comparison of the FC reliability map derived from fast-TR SE + ICA-AROMA data to those shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> indicated better FC reliability brain-wide in OC-ME data when ME-ICA was used (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). The fast-TR SE + ICA-AROMA time × reliability curve (dashed purple line in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) resembled those in the MC and CAST datasets (see <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that faster sampling rates may be beneficial.</p>
        <p id="P24">We conducted a follow-up analysis to further understand the biophysical signal mechanisms underlying better FC reliability in OC-ME data. Specifically, we attempted to separate the effect of recovering short and long T<sub>2</sub>* signals and the incidental dampening of thermal noise by shuffling the “optimal” weights assigned to each voxel. The rationale behind this analysis is that combining echoes in any manner can suppress thermal noise because it has no temporal or spatial structure (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Liu, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Power, 2017</xref>), but recovering short or long T<sub>2</sub>* signals requires appropriate weighting of early and late echoes in particular. Surprisingly, the reliability maps derived from OC-ME and “non-OC” data were nearly identical, with the exception of vertices with a very short T<sub>2</sub>* (&lt;20 ms), which exhibited better reliability in OC-ME data than would be expected by chance after 1,000 random rotations of the T<sub>2</sub>* map on a spherical expansion of each subject’s cortical surface (all p values = 0.001, all <italic>Z</italic> scores &gt; 6.53). This finding indicates that combining echoes according to the T<sub>2</sub>* at each voxel improves the reliability of FC primarily via the incidental dampening of thermal noise (a brain-wide effect), but also by enhancing BOLD sensitivity in brain regions with a very short T<sub>2</sub>* (another region-specific effect).</p>

        <title>More Reliable Mapping of Individual-Specific Functional Topology in ME Data</title>
        <p id="P25">The analyses performed to this point in our report have focused on the reliability of correlations in BOLD fMRI signals, which are the basis for most rsfMRI studies. However, there is increasing interest in higher-level descriptions of an individual’s functional brain organization, including the topology (size, shape, and spatial arrangement) of functional areas and brain networks, the latter of which is typically calculated using only the strongest of these correlations (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">2017c</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we next tested whether ME fMRI could be used to obtain more reliable individual-specific network parcellations. We identified networks brain-wide in each individual using a widely used community detection algorithm, termed InfoMap (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008</xref>), and the precision mapping procedures developed collectively by <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., (2017c)</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al. (2020)</xref>, and <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Marek et al. (2018)</xref>. To aid in the interpretation of the maps produced by this routine, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> shows the networks identified in ME01 when using all 6 h of OC-ME + ME-ICA scans (concatenated). A seed (the gray sphere highlighted by a black arrow) placed in a fronto-parietal network patch highlights how seed FC is strongest within network. Brain networks were mapped in this manner in each of the 18 densely sampled individuals (the 4 individuals scanned using ME sequences + 14 individuals from independent SE datasets) using data from single scans and all other available scans concatenated (the latter of which serves as a kind of ground truth). Reliability was quantified using the adjusted Rand coefficient, which represents the fraction of points in the brain identified as belonging to the same network in single-scan and ground truth data (with values approaching 1 indicating better agreement after adjusting for chance).</p>
        <p id="P26">There was a significant main effect of the OC-ME and ME-ICA procedures (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; <italic>F</italic>(2,187) = 161.65, p &lt; 0.001), such that networks defined using OC-ME + ME-ICA data (red dots in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) were more reliable than those defined in OC-ME (green dots in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; <italic>t</italic>(142) = 5.42, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.82) and TE<sub>2</sub> (purple dots in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; <italic>t</italic>(142) = 15.4, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.57) data denoised using ICA-AROMA. Next, we compared the OC-ME and fast-TR SE data acquired from ME01 (the only participant scanned using both ME and fast-TR SE sequences). OC-ME + ME-ICA data yielded network maps that were more reliable than those defined using the SE acquisition with a faster sampling rate (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>; <italic>t</italic>(46) = 6.44, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.36). Independent SE datasets are shown for comparison in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>. Brain network topologies defined using OC-ME + ME-ICA data were significantly more reliable than those in the MSC (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>; <italic>t</italic>(170) = 9.21, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.16) and CAST (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>; <italic>t</italic>(170) = 3.35, p = 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.65) participants, despite the 2-times difference in scan length. An example of functional brain networks defined using data from a single 14.5 OC-ME + ME-ICA scan and data from all other scans (5.75 h worth of scanning) is shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>. A seed (the gray sphere highlighted by a black arrow) placed in the posterior cingulate reveals that the FC (calculated using data from the single scan) of the seed is strongest within borders of the default mode network (borders defined using the large amount of independent data). Similar visualizations were created using a variety of cortical and subcortical seeds from subsets (5 to 14.5 min; in 5-min steps) of data from three randomly selected OC-ME, fast-TR SE, and TE<sub>2</sub> scans (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S5</xref>–<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that more reliable descriptions of individual-specific functional brain networks can be obtained from relatively small quantities of OC-ME data when signal-decay denoising is used.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P27">In this report, we found enhanced reliability of FC and functional brain network topology in four densely sampled individuals after echoes were combined (OC-ME) and non-neurobiological artifacts were removed using a signal-decay-based denoising approach (ME-ICA). FC reliability increased rapidly with scan duration, such that less OC-ME data was necessary to achieve the same level of reliability in three independent SE datasets (n = 14) or in fast-TR SE data collected from the same individual (see time × reliability curves in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). Several clinically important brain regions that exhibited relatively low FC reliability in SE data were more reliable in OC-ME data, especially when ME-ICA was used. The increased reliability of FC in OC-ME data was associated with more reliable descriptions of individual-specific functional brain networks (see <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that ME fMRI is well suited for rapid precision mapping of functional networks at the individual level and for tracking changes within individuals over time. These enhancements, in turn, could help facilitate clinical neuroimaging research, particularly longitudinal studies of episodic forms of psychiatric illness, and for elucidating the neurobiological basis of individual differences in cognition and behavior.</p>
      <p id="P28">The benefits of ME sequences have been studied for over two decades (<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Posse, 2012</xref>), beginning with seminal work by <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Posse et al. (1999)</xref> showing that combining echoes according to the T<sub>2</sub>* at each voxel increases BOLD sensitivity. For the most part, however, ME fMRI is not widely used—fewer than 1% of the more than 12,000 rsfMRI studies published in the last 10 years used a ME sequence. There are likely multiple reasons for this. For example, there may be the perception that the benefits of ME fMRI are relatively modest or that it is more important to optimize spatiotemporal resolution (i.e., smaller voxels and faster sampling rates). ME fMRI has historically entailed a compromise in either full-brain coverage or spatiotemporal resolution, but recent technological advances (high-density head coils, parallel imaging [<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Schmiedeskamp et al., 2010</xref>], and multi-band acceleration [<xref rid="R99" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2013</xref>]) have made this trade-off less significant. Recent studies have leveraged these advances and found that how fMRI signals decay across echoes can be used to infer if they originate from neurobiological activity or not (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Kundu et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), an approach that has been used to remove head-motion-related artifacts in rsfMRI scans (<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2018</xref>) and enhance statistical power by as much as 149% in task-based fMRI experiments (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Lombardo et al., 2016</xref>). By comparing FC reliability maps derived from three versions of our ME fMRI datasets with key preprocessing and denoising procedures omitted or included (see <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), our investigation found that ME fMRI can also be used to enhance FC reliability. It links this effect to three biophysical signal mechanisms with spatially distinct influences: BOLD signal sensitivity, which can be broken down further into thermal noise (a brain-wide effect) and regional differences in the rate of T<sub>2</sub>* decay (a region-specific effect); and S<sub>0</sub>-dependent artifacts (another region-specific effect). The extent to which ME-ICA improves FC reliability more than other denoising strategies that do not leverage signal-decay information may depend in part on how contaminated the data are by S<sub>0</sub>-dependent artifacts.</p>
      <p id="P29">The significance of our investigation is 2-fold. First, our data indicate that ME fMRI could be used to obtain more stable individual-specific FC-based measurements with less data, which has implications for studies of individual differences in functional brain organization in both health and disease (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Braga and Buckner, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Braga et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Finn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">2017b</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">2017c</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Marek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">Seitzman et al., 2019</xref>). Second, ME fMRI could be especially useful in clinical contexts, where the amount of per-subject data needed to obtain accurate assessments of FC and functional brain network topology is a significant bottleneck (<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">O’Connor and Zeffiro, 2019</xref>). Importantly, some brain regions (e.g., lateral prefrontal, posterior parietal, and a subset of midline cortical areas) yielded generally reliable FC measurements (reliability values ranging from 0.5 to 0.8). However, other regions, including those implicated in neurologic and psychiatric illness (subgenual cingulate [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Mayberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Pizzagalli, 2014</xref>)] and cerebellum [<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Shakiba, 2014</xref>]) exhibited relatively low reliability in both our SE datasets and in three independent datasets (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This was due in part to the fact that these brain regions are susceptible to rapid signal dropout and certain kinds of S<sub>0</sub>-dependent artifacts.</p>
      <p id="P30">The improved test-retest reliability afforded by ME fMRI is not only statistically significant, but also scientifically useful. Low test-retest reliability of FC at the individual level is a fundamental obstacle to numerous within-subject study designs, especially in clinical neuroimaging. Consider, for example, that if an investigator wanted to understand the effect of an intervention on FC in individual patients, it is desirable to minimize artifactual variation in FC within subject over time (which can be driven by various kinds of S<sub>0</sub>-dependent artifacts, such as head movement levels or instabilities of MRI hardware, and removed by ME denoising), so that neurobiologically meaningful changes in FC associated with the intervention can be modeled. In other words, the enhanced reliability afforded by ME fMRI is a reduction in measurement error, which in turn should improve the power to detect brain-behavior effects in both within-subject and cross-sectional studies. ME fMRI could, therefore, help facilitate therapeutic intervention studies, biomarker discovery efforts, and longitudinal studies of functional network plasticity at the individual level.</p>
      <p id="P31">Several aspects of this investigation warrant careful consideration. First, our conclusions are based on data acquired from four densely sampled individuals. Performing analyses separately in each individual enabled a 4-fold replication of all our major findings. However, smaller samples can have limited generality. Mitigating this concern to some degree, we found that the reliability maps and time × reliability curves derived from the second echo in all four ME subjects were comparable to those from 14 individuals from three independent SE datasets. It is also worth noting that head motion was relatively low for some of our study participants (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that they represent a best-case scenario with respect to their ability to remain still and awake during scanning. Second, there is no empirically tested best set of parameters for a ME fMRI scan, and systematically testing different combinations of parameters was outside of the scope of the present study. ME denoising itself is an active area of research and development (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Caballero-Gaudes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Kundu et al., 2012</xref>), and the algorithms used here will likely be improved upon in the near future by other investigators. Third, we are not advocating for ME fMRI scans as a panacea for the challenges inherent to obtaining accurate descriptions of an individual’s functional brain organization. If time and funds permit, collecting more data will improve the reliability of FC measurements, regardless of the sequence or denoising strategy employed. However, an important caveat is that subjects are prone to drowsiness during long rsfMRI scans (<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Tagliazucchi and Laufs, 2014</xref>), and fluctuations in arousal or sleep state can reduce the stability of BOLD fMRI correlations (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), which further underscores the attractiveness of obtaining reliable measurements from shorter scans, if possible.</p>
      <p id="P32">Finally, it is plain that the rate FC estimates become reliable differs across the 14 individuals in the three independent SE datasets (see transparent purple lines representing individual participants in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) and in our 4-participant ME dataset. What factors, other than baseline levels of head motion and other S<sub>0</sub>-dependent artifacts, could account for this variability? Our central hypothesis is that other factors including but not limited to certain kinds of breathing patterns (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2020</xref>) (the effects of which cannot be removed using ME-ICA alone; see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>), participant drowsiness (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2017</xref>), and brain volume (which should affect signal-to-noise by virtue of the physical distance between the brain and the receive coil) all contribute to individual differences in FC reliability. A larger sample of densely sampled individuals is necessary to fully address this issue.</p>
      <p id="P33">Obtaining reliable FC-based measurements of individuals has, to date, required collecting large quantities of per-subject data (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">D’Esposito, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Poldrack, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Satterthwaite et al., 2018</xref>), which may not always be feasible for the clinical applications that have been proposed for rsfMRI, including pre-operative mapping (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2013</xref>), gathering diagnostic and prognostic information (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Drysdale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Dunlop et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2012</xref>), and mapping personalized targets for neuromodulation (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">McMullen, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Medaglia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">Weigand et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that ME fMRI enables more rapid and reliable FC-based measurements in individual subjects by increasing BOLD sensitivity and discarding fMRI signals that do not originate from neurobiological activity. By enabling more reliable measurements from shorter scan times, ME fMRI data may be especially useful for precision functional mapping of individual brains in clinical populations.</p>

          <p id="P42">Data were acquired on a Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3T scanner at the Citigroup Biomedical Imaging Center of Weill Cornell’s medical campus using a Siemens 32-channel head coil. Multi-echo, multi-band resting-state fMRI scans were collected using a T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted echo-planar sequence covering the full brain (TR: 1355 ms; TE<sub>1</sub>: 13.40 ms, TE<sub>2</sub>: 31.11 ms, TE<sub>3</sub>: 48.82 ms, TE<sub>4</sub>: 66.53 ms, and TE<sub>5</sub>: 84.24 ms; FOV: 216 mm; flip angle: 68°; 2.4mm isotropic; 72 slices; AP phase encoding direction; in-plane acceleration factor: 2; and multi-band acceleration factor: 6) with 640 volumes acquired per scan for a total acquisition time of 14 min and 27 s. This sequence was generously provided by the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at the University of Minnesota. Single-echo, multi-band resting-state fMRI scans (referred to in the text as the “fast-TR” single-echo sequence) were collected from participants ME01 and ME02 using T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted echo-planar sequences covering the full brain (TR: 800 ms; TE: 30 ms; FOV: 216 mm; flip angle: 49°; 2.4mm isotropic; 72 slices; AP phase encoding direction; and multi-band acceleration factor: 6) with 1084 volumes acquired per scan for a total acquisition time of 14 min and 27 s. A pair of spin echo EPI images with opposite phase encoding directions (AP and PA) but identical geometrical parameters and echo spacing were acquired to correct spatial distortions. High-resolution (MPRAGE) T1-weighted image (TR: 2400 ms; TE: 2.28 ms; FOV: 256; flip angle: 90°, and 208 sagittal slices with a 0.8 mm thickness) and T2-weighted anatomical images (TR: 3200 ms; TE: 563 ms; FOV: 256; flip angle: 8°, and 208 sagittal slices with a 0.8 mm thickness) were acquired.

The T1- and T2-weighted images were co-registered to an MNI atlas (hereafter referred to as “ACPC” alignment) using a rigid 6 DOF FLIRT transformation. Cortical surfaces were generated using Freesurfer’s “recon-all.v6.hires” pipeline. Pial surface placement was refined using the co-registered T2-weighted image by specifying the “-T2pial” option. Midthickness surfaces were obtained by averaging the pial and white surfaces. Fsaverage-registered left and right hemisphere surfaces (pial, white, and midthickness) were brought into register with each other in fs_LR space (<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">Van Essen et al., 2012</xref>) and resampled to the computationally tractable resolution of 32k vertices using Connectome Workbench command line utilities.</p>

          <title>Multi-echo fMRI preprocessing</title>
          <p id="P44">Preprocessing of multi-echo data minimized spatial interpolation and volumetric smoothing while preserving the alignment of echoes. The single-band reference (SBR) images (five total; one per echo) for each scan were averaged. The resultant average SBR images were aligned, averaged, co-registered to the ACPC aligned T1-weighted anatomical image, and simultaneously corrected for spatial distortions using FSL’s topup and epi_reg programs. Freesurfer’s bbregister algorithm (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Greve and Fischl, 2009</xref>) was used to refine this co-registration. For each scan, echoes were combined at each time point and a unique 6 DOF registration (one per volume) to the average SBR image was estimated using FSL’s MCFLIRT tool (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>), using a 4-stage (sinc) optimization. All of these steps (co-registration to the average SBR image, ACPC alignment, and correcting for spatial distortions) were concatenated using FSL’s convertwarp tool and applied as a single spline warp to individual volumes of each echo after correcting for slice time differences using FSL’s slicetimer program. All denoising was performed on these preprocessed, ACPC-aligned images.</p>

In short, the preprocessed, ACPC-aligned echoes were first combined according to the average rate of T<sub>2</sub>* decay at each voxel across all time points by fitting the monoexponential decay, S(t) = S<sub>0</sub>e<sup>−t / T2</sup>*, using the “nlinfit.m” function in MATLAB with least-squares optimization and the initial coefficient values obtained from a linear model fit to the log of the data. From these T<sub>2</sub>* values, an optimally combined multi-echo (OC-ME) time-series was obtained by combining echoes using a weighted average (W<sub>TE</sub> = TE * e <sup>−TE/ T2</sup>*), as in <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Posse et al. (1999)</xref>. The covariance structure of all voxel time-courses was used to identify major signals in the resultant OC-ME time-series using principal component and independent component analysis. Components were classified as either T<sub>2</sub>*-dependent (and retained) or S<sub>0</sub>-dependent (and discarded), primarily according to their decay properties across echoes following the decision tree described in <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Kundu et al. (2012)</xref>. We found that a global influence of respiration (a T<sub>2</sub>*-dependent signal that is not of interest per se; see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>) was retained after removing S<sub>0</sub>-dependent components. Mean gray matter time-series regression was subsequently performed to remove this spatially diffuse noise. Two other denoising strategies were performed. Specifically, the OC-ME and TE<sub>2</sub> time-series were also submitted to ICA-AROMA (<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Pruim et al., 2015</xref>), a top performing algorithm for denoising single-echo fMRI data (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Ciric et al., 2017</xref>), followed by mean gray matter time-series regression. Finally, temporal masks were generated for censoring high motion time-points using a frame-wise displacement (FD; <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2012</xref>) threshold of 0.3 mm and a backward difference of two TRs (2 * 1.355 = 2.77 s), for an effective sampling rate comparable to historical FD measurements (approximately 2 to 4 s; <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2019a</xref>). Prior to the FD calculation, head realignment parameters were filtered using a stopband Butterworth filter (0.2 – 0.35 Hz) to attenuate the influence of respiration (<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2019a</xref>).

Signals were normalized (z-scored). This yielded time courses representative of the entire cortical surface, subcortex (accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus), and cerebellum, but excluding non-gray matter tissue.</p>

          <title>Functional connectivity reliability maps</title>
          <p id="P47">Functional connectivity (FC) reliability maps were created using the following procedure. For each scan, FC maps were created using each point in the brain as a seed. This involved calculating the correlation between seed time-courses and the time-courses of all cortical vertices. FC maps were calculated using quantities of data corresponding to a range of scan durations (duration calculated before motion censoring), from 1 min to the full duration of individual scans in each dataset, in 1 min steps. Next, the same FC maps were created using all other scans (concatenated) available for that subject. This second set of FC maps served as a putative ground truth. Reliability was calculated at each seed point as the average spatial correlation (R<sup>2</sup>) between individual scan and ground truth FC maps. Thus, high and low reliability values indicate that the FC of a given vertex or voxel calculated using the specified amount of data from a single scan was similar or dissimilar to FC of that same vertex or voxel when calculated using a large amount of independent data. Correlations between pairs of vertices less than 10 mm apart in geodesic space were omitted from this calculation to avoid considering correlations due to spatial smoothing. Time × reliability curves were obtained by averaging reliability values within different anatomical compartments (cortex, subcortical structures, cerebellum) at each scan duration. Points in the time × reliability curves associated with single-echo and multi-echo datasets were compared statistically using the “ttest.m” function in MATLAB (null hypothesis being that the distribution of reliability values observed in independent single-echo data has a mean equivalent to the average value observed in multi-echo data). We note that this analysis differs from previous investigations of FC reliability in densely sampled individuals (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017c</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2015</xref>) in two ways. First, the reliability values here are reported as R<sup>2</sup> and not Pearson correlation <italic>r</italic>. Second, we evaluated the reliability of vertex-to-vertex (and voxel-to-vertex) FC, not parcel-to-parcel FC.</p>

          <title>Vertex-wise mapping of functional brain networks</title>
          <p id="P48">Functional brain networks were mapped brain-wide in individual subjects by following procedures developed collectively in <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al. (2017c)</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al. (2020)</xref>, and <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Marek et al. (2018)</xref>. In short, a 59412 × 59412 functional connectivity matrix summarizing the temporal correlation between the time-courses of all cortical vertices was generated. Correlations between vertices with centroids less than 30 mm apart in geodesic space were set to zero. Community assignments were obtained over a range of graph densities (5% to 0.001%) using the InfoMap algorithm (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008</xref>). A template-matching procedure described in <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al. (2017c)</xref> was used to assign 1 of 15 known brain network identities to the InfoMap communities identified at each graph density. Subcortical and cerebellar voxels were then assigned to a consensus brain network in cortex using the winner-take-all procedure described in <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al. (2020)</xref> and <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Marek et al. (2018)</xref>. We identified “integrative” vertices and voxels (those exhibiting strong FC more than one network) brain-wide by testing if functional connectivity any other network was greater than 66.7% of the correlation with the consensus network assignment. Integrative regions were visualized on the surface and in the volume using stripes (with stripe colors representing the networks present at that point).</p>

          <title>Assessing the reliability of functional brain networks</title>
          <p id="P49">Functional brain networks were mapped in the manner described above using data from individual scans and concatenated data from all other scans available for each subject (the latter serving as a ground truth). Reliability was defined using the adjusted Rand index (calculated using the “zrand.m” function from the Network Community Toolbox; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://commdetect.weebly.com/">http://commdetect.weebly.com</ext-link>), which represents the fraction of points in the brain identified as belonging to the same network in single scan data and ground truth data after adjusting for chance. The effect of the OC-ME and ME-ICA procedures on the reliability of consensus brain network assignments within individuals was assessed using a mixed effects ANOVA model (via the “anovan.m” function in MATLAB), with data type treated as a fixed effect and subject identity treated as a random effect. Comparisons to the three independent single-echo datasets were performed using an independent sample t test (using the “ttest2.m” function in MATLAB). The reliability of functional brain networks derived from fast-TR single-echo and multi-echo data collected from participant ME01 was performed using a paired t test (using the “ttest.m” function in MATLAB).</p>

        <title>Obtaining Reliable Resting-State Functional Connectivity (FC) Estimates Can Require Large Quantities of Single-Echo (SE) fMRI Data Per Subject</title>
        <p id="P55">The reliability of resting-state FC was evaluated brain-wide in three independent SE rsfMRI datasets:</p>
        <p id="P78">(A) The Midnight Scan Club (MSC) dataset (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017c</xref>), which consists of 10 individuals that underwent 10 × 30-min scans (three representative subjects are shown: MSC01, MSC04, and MSC06).</p>
        <p id="P56">(B) The CAST dataset (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Newbold et al., 2020</xref>), which consists of three individuals that underwent 10–14 × 30-min scans (one representative subject shown: CAST01),</p>
        <p id="P57">(C) The MC dataset (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Poldrack et al., 2015</xref>), which consists of a single individual that underwent 84 × 10-min scans.</p>
        <p id="P58">(D) FC reliability maps index (using spatial correlation) how similar the FC of each point in the brain is when calculated using the specified amount of data from a single scan versus a large amount of independent data (all other scans available for that participant concatenated). Values approaching 1 indicate better reliability. The average reliability value within FreeSurfer defined cortical and subcortical regions of interest at each scan duration (the median value across the 14 subjects) is shown. Brain regions are ordered (in descending fashion) from most reliable to least reliable. m, minute.</p>

        <title>A Key Benefit of Multi-echo (ME) fMRI Is Improved BOLD Contrast and Reduced Signal Dropout after Echoes Are Combined</title>
        <p id="P59">(A) A ME fMRI sequence acquires multiple images at different echo times (TE) spanning dozens of milliseconds.</p>
        <p id="P60">(B) Signals decay more rapidly in brain regions with a short T<sub>2</sub>* value, such as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC; purple). Echoes are combined such that those near the estimated T<sub>2</sub>* at each voxel are weighted most heavily, yielding an “optimally combined” ME (OC-ME) time series with improved BOLD contrast, less signal dropout, and dampened thermal noise.</p>
        <p id="P61">(C) W<sub>TE</sub> represents the optimal weight for each echo. T<sub>2</sub>* values are calculated at each point in the brains of ME01 and ME02. Differences in the FC of seed regions with different T<sub>2</sub>* values help to convey the region-specific effect of the OC-ME procedure. FC maps were created using OC-ME and two different kinds of SE data (the second echo of the ME scan and a separate fast-TR SE sequence with a faster sampling rate) that were collected from both ME01 and ME02.

        <title>Functional Brain Network Topology Is More Reliable in Individuals Scanned Using a ME Sequence</title>
        <p id="P69">(A) Functional brain networks identified brain-wide in ME01 using a precision mapping routine and all 6 h of OC-ME + ME-ICA data. A seed (gray sphere) placed in a patch of fronto-parietal control network (yellow) in the left lateral PFC of ME01 highlights how FC is largely constrained within-network. The effect of the OC-ME and ME-ICA procedures on the reliability of individual-specific functional brain network topology was evaluated using a mixed-effects ANOVA model. The OC-ME procedure and ME-ICA denoising algorithm additively enhanced the reliability (indexed using the adjusted Rand coefficient comparing the similarity of network partitions defined using single-scan data and all other scans concatenated) of functional topology in the four densely sampled individuals.</p>
        <p id="P70">(B and C) Comparison of adjusted Rand coefficients from OC-ME + ME-ICA data to those derived from fast-TR SE data (B) collected from the same study participant (ME01) and the three independent SE datasets (C).</p>
        <p id="P71">(D) Functional brain networks mapped using data from a single OC-ME + ME-ICA scan and all other OC-ME + ME-ICA scans (concatenated; 5.75 h total) for sub-ME01. The resting-state FC (calculated using the single-scan data) of a seed (gray sphere; highlighted using an arrow) placed in a default mode network patch is constrained within the borders of this network defined using held-out data, indicating high reliability.</p>
