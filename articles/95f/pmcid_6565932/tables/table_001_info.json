Datasets are characterised by their size (number of subjects, network nodes and links, and data samples), the amount of subject variability (expressed as the standard deviation of connection strengths, over subjects, divided by the mean connection strength; we take the mean of this coefficient of variation over all connections present in the network), the sparsity of the network, and the type of network structure. We use simple circle models of varying sizes, first set out in Wang (2012b) and used in Wang (2012a) and Hinne et\u00a0al. (2015); together with the largest simulation (netsim 4) from Smith et\u00a0al. (2011); a random graph structure; and connection matrices built on estimates of the networks in cat cortex (Scannell et\u00a0al., 1999) and macaque visual cortex (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991).", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_001.csv"}
