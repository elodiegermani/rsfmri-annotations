      <abstract id="ABS1">
        <p id="P1">Recent studies have demonstrated that the mathematical model used for analyzing and interpreting fMRI data in gray matter (GM) is inappropriate for detecting or describing blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals in white matter (WM). In particular the hemodynamic response function (HRF) which serves as the regressor in general linear models is different in WM compared to GM. We recently reported measurements of the frequency contents of resting-state signal time courses in WM that showed distinct power spectra which depended on loca structural-vascular-functional associations. In addition, multiple studies of GM have revealed how functional connectivity between regions, as measured by the correlation between BOLD time series, varies dynamically over time. We therefore investigated whether and how BOLD signals from WM in a resting state varied over time We measured voxel-wise spectrograms, which reflect the time-varying spectral patterns of WM time courses. The results suggest that the spectral patterns are non-stationary but could be categorized into five modes that recurred over time. These modes showed distinct spatial distributions of their occurrences and durations, and the distributions were highly consistent across individuals. In addition, one of the modes exhibited a strong coupling of its occurrence between GM and WM across individuals, and two communities of WM voxels were identified according to the hierarchical structures of transitions among modes. Moreover, these modes are coupled to the shape of instantaneous HRFs. Our findings extend previous studies and reveal the non-stationary nature of spectral patterns of BOLD signals over time, providing a spatial-temporal-frequency characterization of resting-state signals in WM.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely exploited for mapping brain activities by measuring changes in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals that are coupled with energy consumption by neurons (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Ogawa et al., 1990</xref>). Mathematical models have been developed to identify image voxels that exhibit increased signal amplitudes triggered by a task performed by a participant during a scan, thereby mapping the brain activation associated with the task (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Ogawa et al., 1992</xref>). In addition, BOLD signal fluctuations measured during a resting state reflect spontaneous variations in neural activities and reveal intrinsic functional networks characterized according to the degree of temporal synchronization among brain regions (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Biswal, 2012</xref>). While reports of BOLD signals in gray matter (GM) have dominated the fMRI literature, there have been far fewer descriptions of BOLD effects in white matter (WM), partly because they are weaker due to the smaller blood flow/volume compared to GM (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Helenius et al., 2003</xref>). However, a growing body of evidence suggests that BOLD signals can be reliably detected in WM and reflect neural activities (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Courtemanche et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">D’Arcy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Fraser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Gawryluk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Gore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Peer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Schilling et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), and such signals are altered significantly in patients with neurological or psychiatric disorders (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; (Lin et al., 2020); (Lin et al., 2020). Recent studies have demonstrated how the temporal profiles of WM BOLD responses to stimuli are different from GM, with reduced magnitudes and delayed peaks, reflecting differences in hemodynamic conditions between GM and WM (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Fraser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Yarkoni et al., 2009</xref>). These studies highlight the importance of understanding the characteristics of WM timecourses so that they can be incorporated into appropriate detection models to increase their sensitivity.</p>
      <p id="P3">We recently showed that the power spectra of WM time courses differ in shape from those in GM in the low-frequency (0.01–0.08 Hz) band, and that they vary as a function of location and depend on the local neurovascular and anatomical configurations of WM (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the spectral patterns at different locations predict their engagements in functional integration as well as specific human behaviors. These findings suggest the frequency contents of WM signals are hetero-geneous spatially. However, potential additional temporal variations in BOLD signal characteristics in WM have not been investigated, reflecting an assumption that BOLD signals are statistically stationary. Here we examine this assumption and demonstrate that BOLD power spectra vary during a scan and reflect an average of multiple sub-patterns that recur over time.</p>
      <p id="P4">Our data suggest that the time-averaged spectrum (such as reported in our previous study) is, in fact, the combination of five sub-patterns, which we call spectral modes (or frequency modes (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Yaesoubi et al., 2017</xref>)), that recur over time. They include four unimodal modes (each of which exhibits single spectral peaks at different frequencies, modes 1–4) and one uniform mode (with power distributed uniformly across the frequency band of interest at a relatively low level, mode 5). These modes show distinct spatial distributions of their occurrences and durations across WM voxels, and these distributions were highly consistent across individuals. One of the modes (mode 1) exhibited a strong coupling of its occurrence between GM and WM across individuals. More interestingly, two communities of WM voxels were identified according to the hierarchical structures of transitions among modes. Specifically, in community 1, the probability of transitions among modes 1, 2, and 5 are significantly higher than in community 2. By contrast, in community 2, the probability of transitions among modes 3, 4, and 5 are significantly higher than in community 1. Moreover, the instantaneous spectral patterns are associated with distinct HRFs that also vary with time. Our findings extend our previous study by looking at dynamic changes in BOLD spectra and reveal the non-stationary nature of spectral patterns as well as their physiological coupling over time, thereby providing a spatial-temporal-frequency characterization of resting-state BOLD signals in WM.</p>

        <title>HCP data</title>
        <p id="P6">Two hundred individuals were randomly selected from the HCP healthy young adult database (88 male and 112 female, whose ages ranged between 22 and 35 years) (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Van Essen et al., 2012</xref>). The imaging protocols are described in detail in a previous report (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Van Essen et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, all images were acquired using a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner (Siemens AG, Erlanger, Germany). Two sessions of resting-state images were acquired using multiband gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI). Each session was comprised of two runs (left- to-right and right-to-left phase encoding) of 14 min and 33 s each, repetition time (TR) = 720 ms, echo time (TE) = 33.1 ms, voxel size = 2 mm isotropic, number of volumes = 1200. Physiological data, including respiratory and cardiac fluctuations, were recorded throughout fMRI scanning. As structural references, T1 images were acquired using a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE), TR = 2400 ms, TE = 2.14 ms, voxel size = 0.7 mm isotropic.</p>

        <title>Preprocessing</title>
        <p id="P7">As detailed elsewhere, the preprocessed images that were drawn from the HCP repository went through the minimal preprocessing pipelines (MPP) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Glasser et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, T1 images were nonlin-early registered to MNI space using FNIRT (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Jenkinson et al., 2012</xref>) and went through a Freesurfer pipeline producing volume/surface parcellations as well as morphometric measurements (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Dale et al., 1999</xref>). For fMRI, the pipeline consisted of head motion correction, susceptibility-derived distortion correction using reversed-phase encoding directions, and nonlinear registration to MNI space. We carried out additional processing including regression of nuisance variables, including 12 head movement parameters (three translations, three rotations, along with their derivatives), and respiratory and cardiac fluctuations that were modeled by the RETROICOR method (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Glover et al., 2000</xref>), followed by a correction for linear trends and temporal filtering with a band-pass filter (0.01–0.08 Hz). A group-wise WM mask was reconstructed by averaging the WM parcellations (derived from Freesurfer) across all subjects and thresholding at 0.95, which was used for restricting the calculations within WM. In a similar manner, a GM mask was also reconstructed using a lower threshold due to higher individual variabilities therein. 0.65 was specifically selected as an optimal threshold by first setting a threshold of 0.5 which then was increased gradually in steps of 0.01 until there were no overlapping voxels between WM and GM. Finally, to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and to reduce the computational load, we downsampled the preprocessed images from 2 mm resolution to 3 mm.</p>

        <title>Calculation of the spectral modes</title>
        <p id="P8">The workflow for calculating the spectral modes is shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. First, a spectrogram was calculated for the BOLD signal of each voxel using a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Sejdić et al., 2009</xref>) by first splitting the entire time course into a set of partially overlapped windows and calculating the transform for each window. Then the power spectrum of each window was calculated, showing the amplitude of BOLD fluctuations at different frequencies as they varied with time. In practice, we selected a window length of 100.4 s (140 TR) to provide a frequency resolution down to 0.01 Hz, which was considered the low cutoff of the baseline brain activity band (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Yu-Feng et al., 2007</xref>) and has been suggested in several previous works (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Leonardi and Van De Ville, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Vergara et al., 2019</xref>). To provide sufficient temporal resolution while avoiding excessive computation load, we selected a step length of 2.88 s (4 TR). This resulted in 266 windows that overlapped by 97.52 s (136 TR) with each neighbor, evenly spanning the duration of the BOLD time course. By obtaining the spectrograms across voxels and subjects, we obtained a large number of observations (more than 490 million) of the spectral patterns across time. These observations were then grouped into a set of clusters using the K-means method. The modes stand for the centroids of the clusters. Then each window-wise spectral pattern can be assigned to a specific mode according to its Euclidean distance to the centroids. The elbow criterion (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Thorndike, 1953</xref>) was used to determine the optimal value of the number of clusters. Specifically, we successively increased the number of clusters from 1 to 20 and plotted the curve of the sum of the observation-to-centroid distances against the number of clusters. The optimal value of the number of clusters was determined by the location of the elbow on the curve. In practice, to find the elbow point, we used a function that operates by walking along the curve one bisection point at a time and fitting two lines, one to all the points to the left of the bisection point and one to all the points to the right of the bisection point. The elbow is judged to be at a bisection point which minimizes the sum of errors for the two fits (Details can be found at <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35094-knee-point" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35094-knee-point</ext-link>). To further certify the reliability of the number of clusters, we used a bootstrap method to randomly sample a small portion (1000 to 10,000) of the spectral features (from 490 million features in total in our current study) and applied the k-means clustering and elbow method to them. This process was repeated 1000 times and the histogram of the cluster number was calculated.</p>
        <p id="P9">Even though we expected that the result would change (actually be less accurate) if we shorten the window length (as it can not completely cover the frequency of interest 0.01–0.08 Hz) and increased the step size, extra tests were performed using the window length of 100.4 s, 86.4 s (140 TR and 120 TR) and step sizes of 2.88 s, 17.28 s, and 31.68 s (4 TR, 24 TR, 44 TR) based on 10 subjects randomly selected from the 200 data we used in our current work. Furthermore, we tested the step size of 0.72 s (1 TR) which is the highest temporal resolution the HCP data can provide, accompanied by the window length of 100.4 s which fully covered the frequency band we studied. We applied K-means to these data separately and used the elbow criterion to determine the optimal number of modes.</p>

        <title>Calculation and statistics of the occurrence, duration, and transitions of the modes</title>
        <p id="P10">The original BOLD time course of each voxel can be represented by transitions between the five modes over time, including their frequency of occurrence and durations. The occurrences can be obtained by counting the numbers of each mode over the time course. The duration describes how long any mode persists before the signal switches to another mode. As each mode occurs multiple times during scanning, the duration is actually a mean time over multiple occurrences. A transition simply means a specific switch of modes from one to another. The total number of transitions is how many times we identify mode <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> at time point <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> and mode <italic toggle="yes">j</italic> at time <italic toggle="yes">t-1</italic> where <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> ≠ <italic toggle="yes">j</italic>.</p>
        <p id="P11">The occurrences, durations, and transition number can be measured for every voxel, resulting in maps of their distributions for each subject. Before group-level statistics, we performed <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> transformations (i.e., we subtracted the global mean value and then divided by the standard deviation) to each map for each subject. The <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> maps were spatially smoothed within the WM and GM masks separately with a 4 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Then a one-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test was used to identify clusters of voxels that exhibited significantly (group-level) higher values compared to zero (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), the mean measurement across all voxels on the <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> map.</p>

        <title>Calculation of coupling between modes in GM and WM</title>
        <p id="P12">In the case of coupling between mode <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> of GM and mode <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> of WM, for subject <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>, we first extract the <italic toggle="yes">g</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>, the mean occurrence of mode <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> over GM voxels that exhibit a significantly high occurrence of mode <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. Repeating this process for all subjects, we obtain a vector <italic toggle="yes">{g</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>
<italic toggle="yes">i</italic> = <italic toggle="yes">1,2,3,…,200}</italic>. Then for a voxel in WM <italic toggle="yes">x</italic>, we extract the occurrence of mode <italic toggle="yes">B, w</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">xi</italic></sub>. Repeating this process for all subjects, we obtained a vector <italic toggle="yes">{w</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">xi</italic></sub>
<italic toggle="yes">i</italic> = <italic toggle="yes">1,2,3,…,200}</italic>. Then we performed a Pearson’s correlation between <italic toggle="yes">{g</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub><italic toggle="yes">}</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">{w</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">xi</italic></sub><italic toggle="yes">}</italic> for every voxel in WM, producing a distribution of <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> values across all WM voxels <italic toggle="yes">{x}</italic>. The higher <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> of a WM voxel indicates that a higher occurrence of mode <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> in GM predicts a higher occurrence of mode <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> in this voxel in the same subject.</p>

The approach requires no prior hypothesis about the HRF and is based on the notion that relatively large-amplitude BOLD signal peaks represent the occurrence of separable, major, spontaneous events (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Duyn, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Tagliazucchi et al., 2012</xref>). In our study, such events were detected as peaks beyond a specified threshold (here, greater than 1.5 standard deviations over the mean). For each event, a general linear model was fitted using a combination of <italic toggle="yes">s</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">n</italic></sub><italic toggle="yes">(t)</italic>, the onset of the event, and <italic toggle="yes">h(t)</italic>, which represents a linear combination of two gamma functions as well as its temporal derivative. Here <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> characterizes the delay time from the onset to the impulse function <italic toggle="yes">s(t)</italic>, where <italic toggle="yes">s(t)</italic> = 1 only if <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> corresponds to the peaks (events) we detected. The double gamma functions together with temporal derivative are capable of modeling the general HRF with an initial dip (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Friston et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>).

        <title>The spectral modes</title>
        <p id="P19">As illustrated in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, five spectral modes were derived using k-means clustering of windowed spectral patterns (observations) across time windows, WM voxels, and subjects. Modes 1–4, which we called unimodal modes, exhibit single sharp peaks at different frequencies, while mode 5, is a uniform mode, with spectral power relatively constant and low across the frequency band of interest. The same workflow yielded two modes in GM, including one unimodal mode whose pattern is similar to mode 1 in WM and one uniform mode, which approximates to mode 5 in WM. <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref> shows examples of calculated spectrograms from selected WM voxels. We observed that the static power spectral peaks (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref> middle column) we observed in our previous study (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2021</xref>) are primarily determined by widely separated bursts of higher powers, as shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref> left column.</p>
        <p id="P20">The clustering results with respect to different window lengths and step sizes are shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2</xref>. We observed that even with 5% (10 out of 200 subjects) of the data we used in our current manuscript, we successfully reproduce the five modes in WM. More surprisingly, we found that even when we change the window length and step size (within a limited range), the elbow criterion still indicates 5 modes that show consistent distributions with our existing modes. The reproducibility of the number of clusters is shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3</xref>. We observed that, after 1000 repetitions of sampling and clustering, the elbow indicates that 5 is the optimal number for WM in 86.4% of the samples.</p>

        <title>Occurrence and duration of the modes</title>
        <p id="P21">The distribution of voxels that exhibit significantly high occurrence (p&lt;0.05, FWE corrected) of each mode is shown in 3D in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4</xref> shows details of such distributions in axial slices, where the inferior frontal WM voxels exhibit significantly higher occurrences of modes 1 and 5 than other voxels. Meanwhile, the paraventricular and temporal voxels exhibit significantly higher occurrences of modes 3 and 4 than other voxels. However, the occurrences of mode 2 show little group effects, and so are not shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Note that the occurrence of mode 2 is not significantly lower than other modes as shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. In each panel of <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, the boxplots represent the group-level distributions of the number of occurrences and the durations of a mode before a transition to another, measured from the area visualized in the brain maps shown to their left. We observed that mode 5 occurs most often and persists longest across all areas shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. In addition, in general, mode 1 occurs more often and persists longer than modes 3 and 4 in the inferior frontal area, whereas it arises less often and lasts for shorter times in paraventricular and temporal areas, where modes 3 and 4 occur more often. Overall, the number of occurrences and durations is highly consistent across subjects, reflected by the tight interquartile range (distance between the upper bound and lower bound) of the boxes.</p>
        <p id="P22">The distributions of voxels that exhibit significantly higher occurrences of the two modes in GM are shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. Cortical areas that are closer to the surface of the brain exhibited significantly higher occurrences of mode 1 than the rest of GM. Meanwhile, the voxels at insular, temporal areas and cingulate gyrus exhibit significantly higher occurrences of mode 2 than other GM voxels.</p>

        <title>Coupling of occurrence of modes between GM and WM</title>
        <p id="P23"><xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> maps the coupling of the patterns of occurrences of specific modes that are prevalent in specific GM and WM voxels. The intensity of a WM voxel in the left figure indicates the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between the occurrence of mode 1 at the voxel and the average occurrence of mode 1 in the GM region shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> (left) across subjects. It can be observed that a high occurrence of mode 1 in selected surface cortical areas reliably predicts high occurrences of mode 1 in extensive WM voxels in the same subject, and vice versa. The corresponding data that exceed a higher threshold (r&gt;0.45) are shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5</xref>. For comparison, the coupling of occurrences of modes 2,3,4,5 in WM voxels to GM (mode 1) across subjects is shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6</xref>, where we observed that such high occurrence of mode 1 in GM also predicts low occurrences of mode 3 and 4 in similar WM area in the same subject, suggesting a suppressive relationship between these modes in WM.</p>
        <p id="P24">The intensity of a voxel in the right figure of <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> indicates the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between the occurrence of mode 5 at the voxel and the average occurrence of mode 2 in the GM region shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> (right) across subjects. Only a few WM voxels show significant couplings of the occurrence of mode 5 to that of mode 2 in the GM region.</p>

        <title>Transitions among the modes</title>
        <p id="P25"><xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> maps the number of transitions (shown as <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> values) among the five modes for every WM voxel. T values that are beyond a significant level (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, FWE corrected) are visualized in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7</xref>. It can be observed that the inferior frontal area exhibits a significantly low number of transitions compared to the rest of WM.</p>
        <p id="P26"><xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> shows the voxels that exhibit a significantly higher transition from mode <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> to mode <italic toggle="yes">j</italic> than the rest of WM voxels across subjects (one-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, FWE corrected). Two communities of voxels could be clearly identified and are coded by different colors. The lower left panel shows the voxels that exhibit significantly higher transitions among modes 1, 2, and 5 (community 1), along with its transition probability among the five modes shown on the right. The lower right panel shows the voxels that exhibit significantly higher transitions among modes 3, 4, and 5 (community 2), along with its transition probability among the five modes shown on the right. Note that the map with respect to each community was produced by a one-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test (p&lt;0.05, FWE corrected) on the transition maps among modes 1, 2, 5 or among modes 3, 4, 5 across all subjects. We observed that the patterns of transition probabilities are, in general, consistent between the two communities. However, a careful inspection reveals that community 1 exhibits a higher transition probability among modes 1, 2, 5, whereas a lower transition probability among modes 3, 4, 5 than community 2. Note that we have hidden the self transitions, which occupy more than 90% of the entire transitions.</p>

        <title>The relationship between instantaneous HRFs and spectral patterns</title>
        <p id="P27">As shown in <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, the windowed HRFs vary with time as well, and their shapes are strongly coupled to the instantaneous spectral patterns, i.e., an HRF with decreased initial dip and increased time to peak is associated with an increased high-frequency component identified in power spectra. The five spectra modes correspond to distinct HRFs. The shifting peaks of modes 1–4 (shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) reflect the varying magnitudes of initial dips as well as time to peaks in HRFs. As mode 5 exhibits a spectral power relatively constant across the frequency band of interest, the initial dip and time to peak of its associated HRF appear to be the average of those of modes 1–4.</p>

      <title>Discussions</title>
      <p id="P28">This study evaluated spectrograms of BOLD signals in WM in a resting state, which reflect the temporal variations of power spectral patterns within BOLD time courses. Applying k-means clustering to a set of measurements that consisted of such patterns at different time points and from different voxels and subjects, we obtained five dominant modes, equivalent to the centroids of the clusters. Each pattern was then assigned to a mode according to its distance to the centroids. Consequently, the original time course could be represented by the five modes as they varied over time. Several parameters, including occurrence, duration, and the number of transitions, were quantified and showed strong consistency across subjects. Besides that, one of the modes showed a strong coupling of its occurrence between GM and WM across subjects. We also identified two communities of voxels, where community 1 showed a higher probability of transitions among modes 1, 2, and 5 but a lower probability of transitions among modes 3, 4, and 5 than in community 2. Last, we observed that the five modes were associated with distinct HRFs.</p>
      <p id="P29">Time-dependent frequency analysis is a well-established method for evaluating MEG and EEG data, and provides characteristic features of signal spectrograms which are associated with specific neurological conditions (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Bertrand and Tallon-Baudry, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Pantazis et al., 2005</xref>). However, the frequency range of BOLD signals is much more limited so that spectrograms have rarely been applied in fMRI analyses. Recent studies have shown that the time-frequency pattern in GM is capable of describing the variabilities of functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Glover, 2010</xref>) and could be categorized as a set of recurring modes (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Yaesoubi et al., 2017</xref>). These observations, along with our previous findings regarding the distinct power spectra identified in WM (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2021</xref>), led us to investigate the spatial-temporal-frequency characterization of resting-state BOLD signals. The results inform us that the single/dual-peak power spectra calculated from the entire BOLD signal in our previous work (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2021</xref>) are actually the unweighted combinations of a series of time-varying spectral patterns. These patterns can be clustered into five modes, which occurred significantly more often at specific locations and whose distributions are consistent across subjects. However, the occurrences of mode 2 show virtually no group effects. Our further examinations of individual mode distribution maps found that the spatial distributions of mode 2 are widely dispersed with no clear tendency toward particular anatomical locations. Given that mode 2 has a characteristic power spectrum centered ~0.035 Hz, it is unlikely that the lack of spatial localization of this mode is caused by random noise; a more plausible explanation is that their signal fluctuations might be driven by larger-scale neural activities (e.g., (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Turchi et al., 2018</xref>)), on which more localized signal fluctuations from other modes are superimposed. This finding partially explains the dual-peak patterns in power spectra (group level) that we observed in our previous study. That is, the lack of group consistency of the spatial distribution of the occurrence of mode 2 causes the trough (around 0.035 Hz) between the two peaks at a group level (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, three “high-frequency” modes that could be identified in WM were missing from GM. This is consistent with the single-peak pattern of power spectra that we observed in GM in our previous study (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2021</xref>). In the current study, in GM, we identified only one unimodal mode, which is very similar to WM mode 1 in shape and occurs significantly often in cortical areas that are more close to the surface. Our data also suggest that the occurrence of this mode in the cortex is positively associated with the occurrence of WM mode 1 across the entire WM. This finding suggests that the BOLD fluctuations of a specific band (centered at ≈ 0.02 Hz) reflect a global process.</p>
      <p id="P30">The uniform mode, mode 5, exhibits substantially higher occurrence and duration than other modes, suggesting that BOLD fluctuations are maintained at a low power level across frequencies that uniformly vary between 0.01–0.08 Hz most of the time, accompanied by brief bursts (unimodal mode1 2,3,4) with higher power at more concentrated frequency ranges. A similar finding has been reported in GM in a previous study that investigated the dynamic functional connectivities among cortical areas (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Duyn, 2013</xref>), suggesting that spontaneous brain activity may be dominated by brief periods of activity, possibly originating from a neuronal avalanche phenomenon. However, it must also be remembered that all BOLD phenomena reflect hemodynamic changes that are only indirect indications of neural activity. The progression of modes 1–2–3–4 corresponds to a trend of increasing negative dip and slower times to peak of the corresponding HRFs. These may reflect variations in local vasculature and metabolic demand and transitions between them may be influenced by variations in flow and oxygenation. For unimodal modes, modes 1 and 2 occur significantly often in the inferior frontal WM, whereas modes 3 and 4 occur significantly often in the paraventricular and temporal areas. Moreover, these occurrences and durations are consistent across subjects, reflecting a highly reproducible pattern of WM BOLD signal, which has not previously been identified from the original time courses. The spatial distribution of the voxels where modes 3 and 4 frequently occur is similar to the areas with higher fiber complexity identified in our previous work (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Such crossing fiber bundles connect to multiple GM areas. A possible explanation is that these bundles transduce independent neural events from multiple GM regions to which they are connected and which occur at the same time or within a short time window, which in turn evokes a BOLD response with a lower initial dip and increased time to peak in the HRF.</p>
      <p id="P31">We identified two communities of voxels that showed distinct patterns of inter-mode transitions. Transitions between the uniform mode and unimodal modes were substantially more frequent than the transitions among unimodal modes. Particularly, direct transitions between modes 1, 2 and modes 3, 4 were rarely observed. These findings support the notion that mode 5 is a “baseline” mode from which a unimodal mode is likely to first transition before switching to other unimodal modes. Our finding also suggests that such “baseline” mode dominates the inferior frontal area, where, therefore, the time courses exhibited a significantly lower number of transitions.</p>
      <p id="P32">A possible concern is that the observed modes in WM originate from physiological noise sources such as cardiac and respiratory variation which affect WM more due to the lower BOLD signals and different neurovascular anatomy therein. In the current study we regressed out the nuisance variables including 12 motion parameters (three translation, three rotations, along with their derivatives) and physiological regressors modeled by RETROICOR based on the respiratory/cardiac data recorded throughout the resting-state scan. Indeed, HCP provided the ICA-fixed (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Salimi-Khorshidi et al., 2014</xref>) data where noise sources are removed using a more rigorous criterion. However, we can not directly use such data to interpret our findings as the white matter signals, which we are studying in this work, have also been regressed out from them. We are aware that no existing model can completely remove all noise, so residual effects might produce the observed modes. Although we believe this issue applies equally to gray matter, we performed extra analyses to verify that what we observed in our study can not (at least not completely) be explained by nuisance factors. To be specific, we created a simulated time series <italic toggle="yes">BOLD</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fake</italic></sub> for each voxel which stands for a pure nuisance signal (including motion, respiratory and cardiac waveforms, see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8</xref> for details). Then the <italic toggle="yes">BOLD</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fake</italic></sub> went through the same processes, including detrending, band-pass filtering, calculation of spectrogram, as we performed to the preprocessed BOLD data in our original study. Then each window-wise spectral pattern was assigned a mode label by looking for the shortest Euclidian distance between the pattern and centroids of the existing five modes in our current paper. We make a hypothesis that the five spectral modes we observed are not from neural activity but nuisance noises alone. In this case, it is reasonable to believe that <italic toggle="yes">BOLD</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fake</italic></sub> is capable of producing the same modes, which exhibit stronger or at least comparable group-wise effects (e.g., the spatial distribution of mode occurrence) that we observed in our current data where a small portion of noises remain. Otherwise, the hypothesis can be rejected, i.e., our findings are not from noises. In <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8</xref>, we compare the group-wise distribution of mode occurrences based on <italic toggle="yes">BOLD</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fake</italic></sub> data, data used in our current study, ICA-fixed data as well as our current data with CSF signal regressed out. Note that the results are based on 10 participants randomly selected from the 200 data in our original study and therefore the visualized voxels are based on a more relaxed threshold (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01, uncorrected). We observed that the spatial distributions of mode occurrences are consistent with our current findings when using 5% of the data (no matter with or without CSF regression) in our current work. However, the results based on <italic toggle="yes">BOLD</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fake</italic></sub> and ICA-fixed data produce different distributions. This finding suggests that our hypothesis can be rejected. In other words, the modes we observed are not from nuisance factors. In a similar manner, we tested whether mode 5 originated from susceptibility artifacts due to the distinct location (frontal lobe). In <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8</xref>, we also compared the group-wise distribution of occurrences of mode 5 based on <italic toggle="yes">BOLD</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fake</italic></sub> data (lower-right corner) and data used in our current study. Note that the <italic toggle="yes">BOLD</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fake</italic></sub> data here include the susceptibility waveforms extracted from the “bad ICs” identified by ICA-FIX tool. We observed that the spatial distributions of mode 5 occurrences are consistent with our current findings when using 5% of the data in our current work. However, the results based on <italic toggle="yes">BOLD</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fake</italic></sub> produce a completely different distribution, demonstrating that mode 5 is not caused by susceptibility artifacts. Note that to further quantify the reproducibility of the 10 test data we selected, we calculate the Pearson’s correlation between the distribution maps of occurrence from test data (10 participants) and original data (200 participants). As shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S9</xref>, the spatial distribution of occurrences between the same modes (diagonal) exhibits a high correlation, reflecting a good reproducibility of the test data. Meanwhile, the correlation between modes 1 and 5, and between 3 and 4 is relatively high, which is consistent with the spatial maps we showed in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. In addition, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S10</xref> visualizes the mode occurrences based on <italic toggle="yes">BOLD</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fake</italic></sub> data and our current data on the same template image for easier comparisons.</p>
      <p id="P33">In summary, this is the first report of spatial-temporal-frequency characterization of BOLD resting-state time courses in white matter. Our results revealed the non-stationary nature of the spectral patterns of BOLD fluctuations in WM. The measurements of BOLD spectra were highly consistent and reproducible, including occurrence, duration, and transitions of modes, and reveal recurring patterns of power spectra as well as HRFs that have not been previously reported in WM BOLD signals, adding to our understanding of spatial-temporal-frequency-physiological associations in the human brain.</p>

Each observation is a vector, recording the spectra pattern of the signal corresponding to a specific time window. Observations were grouped into five clusters for WM and two clusters for GM using the K-means method. The elbow criterion was used to determine the optimal value of the # of clusters.</p>

        <p id="P47">Relationship between instantaneous HRFs and spectral patterns. The upper and middle panel shows the HRFs (right) calculated in selected time windows where the spectral patterns (left) show peaks at different frequencies. Note that these two panels correspond to two voxels randomly selected from one subject. The lower panel shows the HRF corresponding to the five WM modes. Each line is the average HRF estimated from all time windows that have been assigned to a mode across time and voxels of the selected subject.</p>
