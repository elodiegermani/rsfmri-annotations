Empty cells indicate there was no control condition or that the results were not reported. The direction columns indicates whether the study reported increases (\u201c+\u201d), decreases (\u201c\u2212\u201d) or no change (\u201c\u00d8\u201d) in resting-state connectivity. Location indicates whether the RSFC changes were observed within the stimulated network (In), or out of the stimulated network (Out), as defined by the stimulation target. The following abbreviations were used: DA: dorsal attention, DM: default mode, FL: fronto limbic, L: limbic, O: other, SM: somato motor, V: visual, VA: ventral attention.
