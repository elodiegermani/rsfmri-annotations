          <title>Background:</title>
          <p id="P1">Previous studies in people with substance use disorders (SUDs) have implicated both the frontopolar cortex and amygdala in drug cue reactivity and craving, and amygdala-frontopolar coupling is considered a marker of early relapse risk. Accumulating data highlight that the frontopolar cortex can be considered a promising therapeutic target for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in SUDs. However, one-size-fits-all approaches to TMS targets resulted in substantial variation in both physiological and behavioral outcomes. Individualized TMS approaches to target cortico-subcortical circuits like amygdala-frontopolar have not yet been investigated in SUDs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P11">Substance use disorders (SUDs) are characterized by recurrent, compulsive, and excessive use of drugs that activate the brain’s reward system [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Previous work has implicated both the frontopolar cortex (medial prefrontal cortex, Brodmann Area 10) and the amygdala in substance-associated plasticity through the prefrontal-limbic system [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The amygdala is critical in responses to affective stimuli, and the frontopolar cortex is thought to be involved in tasks that require control of cognition and action [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Amygdala-frontopolar coupling is also recognized as a marker of early relapse risk in people with SUDs[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Both anatomical (white matter tracts) [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and functional [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] connections between the frontopolar cortex and amygdala were reported in both human and animal studies. The functional connection between these two regions is dynamic and can be modulated with real-time fMRI amygdala neurofeedback [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or frontopolar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
      <p id="P12">The frontopolar cortex is considered a transdiagnostically relevant TMS target that induces local activation of neurons as well as transsynaptic activation of distal functionally/anatomically connected brain regions [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previous TMS studies showed that excitatory/inhibitory stimulation of the frontopolar area can modulate cortico-subcortical circuits (e.g., frontopolar-amygdala) involved in drug cue reactivity and ultimately decrease drug-related behaviors such as drug craving and consumption [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]-[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For instance, it has been reported that inhibitory rTMS over the left frontopolar cortex can potentially revert hyperactivity in brain regions related to SUDs including the striatum, insula, and amygdala [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although frontopolar TMS has already been applied clinically for SUDs, little is known about protocol optimization, especially as relating to the inter-individual variability [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
      <p id="P13">The integration of TMS with neuroimaging data, such as fMRI, has advanced our understanding of the functional correlates of TMS by revealing alterations in brain activity/connectivity patterns. This approach helps to utilize between-subject variations in response to stimulation for more precise positioning of the TMS coil over a therapeutic target [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Previous TMS studies in SUDs used standard scalp-based targeting methods (e.g., EEG standard system) or neuronavigation systems which ignore the heterogeneity of the employed TMS dosage and functional brain network topography [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Current clinical practice for depression identifies the optimal stimulation target using TMS-fMRI integration, shifting the focus from brain anatomical regions to brain circuits at the individual level [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]-[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It has been observed that anti-depressant outcomes were better when TMS was applied at sites of the DLPFC that showed a stronger negative correlation with the sub-genual cingulate cortex. These findings were corroborated in several studies [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]-[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and the individualized method augmented with depth-corrected stimulation intensity in an accelerated protocol recently received FDA clearance [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Similarly, investigating the effects of functionally guided, connectivity-based rTMS on amygdala activation were also investigated by individually targeting the prefrontal cortex in healthy young adults offered promising preliminary evidence that fMRI-informed targeting may provide a useful approach to treat network dysregulation [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To improve stimulation accuracy even further, integrating functional connectivity maps with electric field (EF) simulation was also suggested by estimating the changes in connection strength based on inter-individual variability in the head and brain anatomy [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, less attention has been paid to optimizing stimulation methods in TMS for SUDs.</p>
      <p id="P14">Inspired by previous functional connectivity maps integrated with EFs for TMS targeting, we believe that individualized stimulation approaches can precisely identify a coordinate in the frontopolar area to effectively modulate the amygdala-frontopolar circuit in individuals with SUDs. We applied this approach to a group of participants with methamphetamine use disorders (MUDs). We aimed to: (1) individualize TMS target location based on functional connectivity of the amygdala-frontopolar circuit during exposure to drug-related cues, (2) optimize coil orientation based on maximizing electric field (EF) perpendicular to the individualized target, and (3) harmonize EF strength in targeted brain regions across 60 participants with MUDs. Our computationally informed method seeks to optimize TMS protocols for SUDs via refined, individually targeted modulation of cortico-subcortical circuits.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p id="P15">60 participants (all-male, mean age ± standard deviation (SD) = 35.86 ± 8.47 years ranging from 20 to 55) with MUD were recruited during the early abstinence phase (abstinence from methamphetamine for at least 1 week to maximum 6 months) of their participation in a residential recovery program from the 12&amp;12 residential drug addiction treatment center in Tulsa, Oklahoma (Identifier: <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03382379" ext-link-type="uri">NCT03382379</ext-link>). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before participation and the study was approved by the Western IRB (WIRB Protocol #20171742). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. More details on inclusion/exclusion criteria are in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary materials</xref> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Section S1</xref>) [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>

        <title>Data acquisition procedure</title>
        <p id="P16">High-resolution structural MRI, resting state fMRI, and fMRI drug cue reactivity task data were collected from all 60 participants on a GE MRI 750 3T scanner. Structural MRI data included T1 and T2-weighted images collected through magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence and were used to create individualized computational head models. During resting-state data collection participants were instructed to relax and stare at a fixation cross, remain awake, and try not to think of anything in particular for 8 minutes. After resting-state data collection, to measure cue-induced brain activity, a standard pictorial block-designed fMRI drug cue reactivity (FDCR) task was administered. Participants were exposed to methamphetamine versus neutral cues (validated in a previous study [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). The total task time was approximately 6.5 minutes and contained 4 neutral and 4 methamphetamine picture blocks. Each block included a series of 6 pictures of the same category (methamphetamine or neutral), and each was presented for 5 sec with a 0.2-sec blank inter-stimulus interval. A visual fixation point was presented for 8 to 12 sec between each block. More details on MRI data parameters can be found in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary materials</xref> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Section S2</xref>). Self-report craving scores were also collected immediately before and after the MRI session using a visual analog scale (VAS) to measure the severity of the craving (0-100).</p>

        <title>Task-based functional activity analysis for defining a subcortical seed</title>
        <p id="P17">Functional data analysis was performed in AFNI. The first three pre-steady state images were removed. The preprocessing steps were as follows: despiking, slice timing correction, realignment, transformation to MNI space, and 4 mm of Gaussian FWHM smoothing. Three polynomial terms and the six motion parameters were regressed-out. TRs with excessive motion (defined as the Euclidian norm of the derivative of the six motion parameters being greater than 0.3) were censored during regression. Statistical analysis of individual imaging data was performed using a first-level fixed effects analysis, in the context of the General Linear Model (GLM). For each participant, a contrast image of methamphetamine &gt; neutral was constructed and a voxel-wise whole-brain analysis was used to identify the effect of the condition (methamphetamine&gt;neutral) and reported P &lt; 0.001. For each participant, Brainnetome atlas parcellation, with a total of 246 cortical and subcortical areas, was applied, and mean beta weight values were estimated for all subregions [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The amygdala sub-regions (including left and right medial and lateral amygdala) obtained from the Brainnetime atlas-based parcellation of the fMRI data with the maximum functional activation related to methamphetamine cue reactivity was selected as the seed region that would be modulated by TMS through cortico-subcortical circuits.</p>

        <title>Task-based functional connectivity analysis for defining an individualized cortical target</title>
        <p id="P18">Task-based functional connectivity analysis was performed using the CONN toolbox (v.20.b) [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] in SPM 12. FDCR data underwent a standard preprocessing pipeline in CONN which includes slice timing correction, realignment, co-registration, spatial normalization, and smoothing with an 8mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Seed-to-whole brain generalized psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis (a bivariate regression analysis for task-based connectivity calculations [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]) was performed on the left medial amygdala as the seed. PPI analysis identifies brain regions whose connectivity with the seed region varies as a function of psychological context (here, reactivity to methamphetamine vs. neutral cues). At the first level, the physiological regressors of interest were the timings of methamphetamine and neutral blocks in the task convolved with a hemodynamic response function. The physiological regressor was calculated as the mean time series of the seed region, namely, the left medial amygdala (Brainnetome mask). The PPI regressors were the interaction terms between psychological and physiological regressors, namely, (methamphetamine×physiological) and (neutral×physiological), and the contrast of interest (methamphetamine×physiological) vs (neutral×physiological). These were estimated for each participant to determine which voxels work together with the seed region during the methamphetamine vs. neutral condition. The second level PPI analysis was also performed to determine the significant clusters using voxel-wise and cluster-extent thresholds. Active clusters were reported when surviving a voxel-level statistical threshold of two-sided t-value&gt;3.1 and cluster-level threshold of cluster size&gt;60 voxels.</p>
        <p id="P19">Based on first-level PPI connectivity maps, we respectively computed personalized TMS targets within the frontopolar area; its mask was obtained from the results reported by Bludau et al. [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. As there was no specific laterality in previous TMS studies in the field of SUDs, both left and right hemispheres and lateral and medial parts of the frontopolar were searched to find the maximum connection between the amygdala and frontopolar cortex. The voxel with the strongest positive PPI connectivity (Beta values for the PPI regressor as defined in the previous paragraph) to the subcortical area with the highest functional activity during drug cue exposure was selected as the individualized TMS target for each individual.</p>

        <title>Construction of head models</title>
        <p id="P20">Computational head models were generated for all participants using finite element modeling (FEM) implemented in SimNIBS 3.2 standard pipeline [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Briefly, T1 and T2 weighted MRI data were used to generate anatomically accurate models based on “headreco” option with the SPM 12 toolbox for tissue segmentation. The constructed head meshes consisted of six tissue types: white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), eyeballs, skull, and scalp with fixed conductivity values; as per the SimNIBS defaults (WM = 0.126 Siemens/meter (S/m), GM = 0.275 S/m, CSF = 1.654 S/m, skull = 0.01 S/m, scalp = 0.465 S/m, and eyeballs = 0.5 S/m) [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The results were visualized using Gmsh and MATLAB.</p>
        <p id="P21">To investigate possible effects due to individualized fMRI-informed TMS targeting, three sets of EF distribution patterns were simulated. (a) F<underline>ixed Fp2 approach</underline>: in the first set of simulations, EEG 10-10 system Fp2 electrode was selected to target the right frontopolar with fixed standard orientation (y direction toward AF8) across the population in a one-size-fits-all manner (inspired by [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]), (b) <underline>Fixed Fp1 approach:</underline> in the second set of simulations, EEG 10-10 system Fp1 electrode was selected to target the left frontopolar with fixed standard orientation (y direction towards AF7) across the population in a one-size-fits-all manner (inspired by [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). These two approaches were commonly used for targeting the frontopolar area in previous TMS studies for SUDs [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. (c) <underline>Optimized approach</underline>: optimization was performed at three levels: (1) location, (2) orientation, and (3) intensity. The individualized fMRI-informed approach was used in the third set of simulations. TMS coil was placed over the individualized cortical coordinate obtained from maximum task-based functional connectivity between the amygdala and frontopolar cortex. Coil orientation was then optimized for each person to maximize the EF perpendicular to the targeted brain coordinate using the Auxiliary Dipole Method (ADM) [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] embedded in SimNIBS. These three sets of simulations enabled us to make more direct comparisons between optimized fMRI-informed and fixed TMS targeting, minimizing extraneous methodological differences. Location and value of the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of the EFs were calculated for each person and, with respect to the linearity and superposition principle, individualized stimulation intensity was suggested to have similar EF strength (e.g., 1 V/m) in targeted brain regions across the population.</p>
        <p id="P22">Of the various coil models available in SimNIBS, primary EFs were calculated using a Magstim 70mm Figure-of-eight coil, which is the most common coil type in both clinical and research settings. Mean, median, and peak EF strength were extracted in a 5mm sphere around the individualized targets in each set of simulations. Results were compared using ANOVA with paired sample t-tests as post hoc analyses.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P29">Here, we explained how structural and functional MRI can be used to identify stimulation parameters for TMS targets and optimize electric field/dose (EF) distribution patterns across a population with methamphetamine use disorder (MUDs) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Specifically, this investigation yielded five main results. First, the left medial amygdala showed the highest functional activity during drug cue exposure and was selected as the subcortical seed region. Second, amygdala-to-whole brain PPI analysis showed a significant cluster in the frontopolar/medial prefrontal cortex that confirms cortico-subcortical connections during drug cue exposure. Third, the location of the voxel with the most positive amygdala-frontopolar PPI connectivity in each participant was considered as the individualized TMS target and individual amygdala-frontopolar PPI connectivity in each participant showed a significant correlation with VAS scores after cue exposure. Fourth, the average EF strength in a sphere with r = 5mm around the individualized target location was significantly higher in the optimized compared to the fixed approach with large effect sizes. Finally, stimulation intensity was adjusted for each person to have harmonized to have identical EF intensity over personalized targets for all participants.</p>

        <title>Neural substrate of drug cue reactivity: hyperactivity in the amygdala</title>
        <p id="P30">Our functional activity analysis of the drug cue reactivity task (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) showed strong activation in all amygdala subregions, with the highest activation in the left medial amygdala while participants were exposed to drug vs. neutral cues. Our results are in accordance with previous studies that suggest the presentation of drug cues appears to reliably activate brain regions involved in the reward/motivation network, including the ventral striatum and amygdala [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In this study, the left medial amygdala was chosen as the subcortical seed region due to its highest activation during drug cue exposure. This selection is supported by previous research indicating that amygdala activation in response to drug cue exposure plays a critical role in drug-related behaviors [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]-[<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], such that cue-induced craving score is correlated with activation in the amygdala when people were exposed to drug cues [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Furthermore, the effectiveness of interventions such as cue exposure therapy [<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] or methadone maintenance treatment [<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] in reducing cue reactivity in the amygdala provides further support for our seed selection.</p>

        <title>Connections between the amygdala and prefrontal areas in SUDs</title>
        <p id="P31">Here, we focused on frontopolar-amygdala circuits as a potential TMS target in SUDs and tried to find individualized coordinates to optimally target this brain circuit. Although TMS cannot directly modulate the activity of deeper brain areas like the amygdala, its effects can spread through brain networks [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Our amygdala-to-whole brain PPI analysis also supported this idea by revealing a significant positive cluster (increased PPI connections) in the frontopolar/medial prefrontal cortex with a peak activation in the frontopolar cortex (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This finding confirms cortico-subcortical pathways between the prefrontal amygdala and is in line with previous studies that reported functional connections between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala during drug cue processing [<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p>
        <p id="P32">Furthermore, previous studies support our assumption for considering the frontopolar-amygdala circuit as a TMS target for SUDs from different perspectives. (1) Accumulating data highlights the frontopolar cortex as a promising therapeutic target for TMS in SUDs (e.g., lesion-based studies [<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], tES studies [<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], TMS studies [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). (2) It has been reported that impairment in functional coupling between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala is negatively correlated with the ability to control negative emotions [<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. (3) Optogenetic studies in male rats showed that chronic alcohol exposure decreased frontopolar-amygdala synaptic strength and accommodation and introduced this brain circuitry as a significant target of the alcohol-associated plasticity [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. (4) Resting-state fMRI analysis also supported frontopolar-amygdala coupling as a marker of relapse in participants with cocaine use disorders [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It has been reported that early relapse risk is associated with reduced connectivity between the left cortico-medial amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (comparable to the brain region identified as the frontopolar in our study). In that study, even the site of the amygdala (left medial) is consistent with our results [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. (5) It has been reported that the frontopolar cortex triggered plasticity events inside the amygdala that plays an important role in the extinction of drug-seeking behaviors [<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Taken together, all of these findings support the potential for engagement of the amygdala through frontopolar-amygdala functional pathways in the SUD treatment [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], [<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], and highlight the necessity of effective TMS protocols for future clinical trials in the field.</p>

        <title>Individualized circuit-based targeting</title>
        <p id="P33">Coli localization is an important factor in TMS studies. Here, we investigated how far the optimal fMRI-informed target deviates from the fixed EEG-based target which is commonly used. Our individualized approach calculated coordinates for targeting drug-cue-relevant frontopolar-amygdala for each person. In contrast to fixed targeting methods, our results showed notable inter-individual variability in terms of the target locations. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4.a1</xref> showed that this distance was different between individuals. In line with previous findings in connectivity-based target selection [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], these findings reveal variations in the frontopolar coordinate connected to the amygdala, which could potentially explain some of the inter-individual variability observed previously in response to TMS targeting frontopolar cortex for SUDs [<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Results highlight the importance of coil location optimization in circuit-based stimulation and indicate that anatomical and functional information could be used to estimate the optimal coil position for targeting the frontopolar cortex.</p>
        <p id="P34">We considered the strongest positive z-value in the connection between the amygdala and frontopolar as the TMS target. Because it has been reported that inhibitory rTMS over the frontopolar can potentially revert hyperactivity in brain subcortical regions such as the amygdala [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and based on the common frequency-dependent effects of rTMS, we expect that inhibitory stimulation to a positively connected frontopolar node would dampen the positive connectivity between the frontopolar and amygdala, a change that could potentially reduce drug-related behaviors like drug craving and consumption. We also found a positive significant correlation between the most positive amygdala-frontopolar PPI connectivity and self-reported craving scores after drug cue exposure (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, people with stronger connectivity reported a higher cue-induced craving score). This finding supports our assumption and suggests that inhibitory stimulation over the coordinates with the most positive connections to the amygdala might be successful in reducing craving scores. Future research should include clinical testing of different TMS targeting methods to understand the comparative effects of each technique on behavioral outcomes.</p>

        <title>Optimizing coil orientation</title>
        <p id="P35">Here, we optimized coil orientation over personalized TMS targets in the frontopolar area. Due to the presence of measurable markers such as motor-evoked potential, the optimal coil orientation is well-known for the motor cortex while the optimal coil orientation remains to be determined for other brain areas [<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Furthermore, although there is an increasing number of fMRI-informed TMS studies to determine coil location for each person, less attention has been paid to optimizing coil orientation in previously published clinical trials [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], [<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Our results showed that coil orientation optimization significantly increased EF strength over the frontopolar cortex compared to fixed orientation, which is commonly used in TMS studies. Our results suggest that coil angle optimization based on the anatomical shape of the head should be considered for estimating the most effective stimulation parameters over the frontopolar cortex as supported by previous TMS studies in other brain targets like motor cortex [<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], [<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p>

        <title>Harmonizing EF strength across the sample</title>
        <p id="P36">Our simulations with a fixed TMS dose showed inter-individual variability at the cortical target site (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In line with previous modeling studies, at the cortical target site, in both fixed and individualized fMRI-informed locations, intensities substantially varied between individuals [<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], [<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Our findings support that fixed-dose TMS which is typically used in clinical trials may result in varying physiological or behavioral effects among individuals. As suggested by Evans et al controlling for this source of variability must be a priority [<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Therefore, we adjusted the stimulation intensity for each individual to control the stimulation dose and reduce EF variability in the targeted brain region. As expected, by individualizing the dose, the EF was consistent near the target site and reached a specific target intensity. Here, inspired by [<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], we adjusted stimulation intensity to harmonize EF across individuals with the assumption that there is a straightforward (linear) dose-response relationship between the physiological/behavioral effects of TMS and the delivered stimulation dose in the targeted brain region. Hence, we controlled the EF that was delivered to each personalized target location. Our assumption is supported by previous studies suggesting that EF intensity in a cortical target predicts response to the applied brain stimulation technology [<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], [<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. However, other factors such as EF direction in the targeted area, the spatial extent of the EF in each person, above threshold EF intensity in non-targeted brain regions, or ongoing brain state may be relevant to the observed response.</p>

        <title>Limitations and future directions</title>
        <p id="P37">Our study has some limitations that could be addressed in future research. First, whether frontopolar-amygdala connectivity is the clinically optimal target for MUDs remains an open question. Although there are promising results in previous frontopolar-amygdala connectivity-based TMS in healthy young adults [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the fMRI-informed target selection approach is still new in the field of brain stimulation for SUDs [<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Replication in larger cohorts to draw a general conclusion about the optimal cortico-subcortical biomarker is needed that can be informative for predictive/treatment-response biomarker extraction in future TMS studies.</p>
        <p id="P38">Second, our study did not include manipulation of the targeted circuit with TMS. Prospective research testing the proposed optimized targeting approach needs to be tested in future studies by collecting fMRI before and after optimized rTMS and comparing the results with a non-optimized approach (e.g., fixed standard method) to test for BOLD and connectivity changes due to stimulation and how each approach affects behavioral outcomes, e.g., craving.</p>
        <p id="P39">Third, we only investigated task-based fMRI data to engage the fronto-limbic network and induce Hebbian-like plasticity [<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Others have focused on resting-state fMRI data collection [<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], [<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] to reduce the need for participant compliance and avoid confounds related to task performance or instructions [<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. fMRI-informed TMS target selection based on resting-state networks may exhibit higher reproducibility compared to conventional task-based imaging [<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Direct comparisons of task-based vs. resting-state-defined TMS network targeting will be important in future SUD research.</p>
        <p id="P40">Fourth, we created computational head models only based on T1 and T2-weighted images with previously established isotropic conductivities, as is common in computational studies. Anisotropic skull and white matter conductivities significantly affect EF distribution patterns [<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] which is important when considering deeper target regions inside the brain [<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Anisotropic conductivities could be calculated based on diffusion tensor imaging in future studies to increase the accuracy of computational head modeling as it has been shown that in TMS simulations anisotropy led to differences up to 10% in the maximum induced EFs [<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Furthermore, we used constant tissue conductivities while variations in reported human head tissue electrical conductivity values may have effects on simulation outcomes [<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Although assuming conductivity from the literature is insufficient, obtaining the personalized values at body temperature at frequencies&lt;100Hz and in natural, in-vivo conditions would be difficult and unavailable. Other physiological factors such as motor-evoked potentials that could be partly explained by EFs in the motor cortex can be used for future dose-controlled TMS studies [<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].</p>
        <p id="P41">We focused only on coil location, orientation, and stimulation intensity harmonization across the population. However, there is a large TMS parameter space, and many other factors can affect stimulation outcomes that could be considered in future studies. For example, in a TMS clinical trial, train duration, inter-train interval, pulse numbers, session number, pulse width, pulse shape, and frequency could be optimized for each individual by considering initial brain state, EF distribution patterns, and behavioral outcomes.</p>
        <p id="P42">Here, our sample only consisted of male participants. Previous studies on brain stimulation and substance use disorders have reported on the impact of sex differences on electric field distribution patterns and brain functions [<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], [<xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. It is recommended to include both males and females in future research to ensure the findings are representative of the entire population.</p>
        <p id="P43">Future dose-response studies could be informative to optimize all related factors for each individual or across a population based on the association between the stimulation parameter and stimulation efficacy [<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], [<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. For example, an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve was reported by Huang et al., for the number of stimulation pulses such that 600 pulses produced a more durable response than 300, while 1200 pulses produced inhibitory effects rather than increasing the effects of 600 pulses [<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Dose-response relationship studies can be leveraged to design new TMS parameters that optimally manipulate brain responses in future clinical trials.</p>
        <p id="P44">Finally, future closed-loop TMS-fMRI systems that allow automatic adjustment of the stimulation location and orientation, e.g., with a robotically controlled stimulator, raise the possibility of real-time optimization of the coil location, orientation, and stimulation intensity/frequency based on personalized ongoing brain state. Automated closed-loop TMS-fMRI with a suitable optimization algorithm implementation help to adaptively adjust stimulation parameters in a multidimensional search space [<xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. However, an MRI-compatible device, a high-speed optimization algorithm, and powerful computational resources for generating and analysis of head models are needed to implement closed-loop TMS-fMRI systems.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p id="P45">The effectiveness of non-invasive brain stimulation technologies like TMS is limited by individual differences in response. This study aimed to improve TMS outcomes by customizing stimulation parameters based on individual variability of functional connectivity parameters. The study found that personalized TMS targets can improve connectivity between the amygdala and frontopolar circuits, which are important for regulating addiction-related behaviors. Furthermore, our proposed circuit was consistent with a previously reported circuit that was identified as a predictor of relapse status [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, the study emphasizes the importance of individualized coil placement, orientation, and stimulation intensity adjustment. These findings can help refine TMS therapy for substance use disorders, and future research should investigate whether this approach can improve neural and behavioral outcomes in clinical trials.</p>

        <title>Study procedure.</title>
        <p id="P49">In this study, we used 6 main steps to optimize the TMS protocol for a group of participants with methamphetamine use disorder. <bold>(a) Activating desired brain region with the task of interest.</bold> A standard drug cue reactivity task was used to activate brain regions related to cue-induced craving. Behavioral data including self-report cue-induced craving was also collected immediately before and after the task. <bold>(b) Finding activated subcortical areas.</bold> Functional activity analysis using a general-linear model (GLM) was recruited to find subcortical seed regions that were activated in response to drug vs. neutral cues. <bold>(c) Finding cortico-subcortical circuit that modulates behavior.</bold> Based on a prior hypothesis, the subcortical region with maximal functional activation was selected as the seed. Seed-to-whole brain psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was applied to understand which brain areas are functionally connected to the seed region during drug cue exposure. The cortical target area was selected based on the available literature in the field (e.g., based on the importance of frontopolar-amygdala [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and previous potential TMS targets [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] in SUD) <bold>(d) Finding max/min cortico-subcortical connection.</bold> The location and strength of the maximal (the most positive value) PPI connection between the subcortical seed region and cortical target mask was extracted for each person. The correlation between maximal PPI strength and changes in cue-induced craving was also calculated. The MNI coordinates of the maximal PPI connections were transformed to the individual space which was considered as the individualized TMS target location for each person. <bold>(e) Optimization of the stimulation parameter.</bold> Computational head models were generated for all participants. The location and orientation of the TMS were optimized for each person based on the maximal PPI locations and maximizing electric field perpendicular to the targeted location. <bold>(f) Comparing the simulation results with one-size-fits-all approaches.</bold> Simulation results obtained from optimized coil location and orientation for each person were compared with two one-size-fits-all approaches that were commonly used for targeting the frontopolar area by placing the TMS coil over the Fp1 or Fp2 locations. Finally, in order to have identical EF strength in the stimulation target, stimulation intensity was adjusted across the population.</p>
