      <abstract>
        <p>Epidemiologic studies associate maternal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/DHA-containing seafood intake with enhanced cognitive development; although, it should be noted that interventional trials show inconsistent findings. We examined perinatal DHA supplementation on cognitive performance, brain anatomical and functional organization, and the brain monoamine neurotransmitter status of offspring using a piglet model. Sows were fed a control (CON) or a diet containing DHA (DHA) from late gestation throughout lactation. Piglets underwent an open field test (OFT), an object recognition test (ORT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to acquire anatomical, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) at weaning. Piglets from DHA-fed sows spent 95% more time sniffing the walls than CON in OFT and exhibited an elevated interest in the novel object in ORT, while CON piglets demonstrated no preference. Maternal DHA supplementation increased fiber length and tended to increase fractional anisotropy in the hippocampus of offspring than CON. DHA piglets exhibited increased functional connectivity in the cerebellar, visual, and default mode network and decreased activity in executive control and sensorimotor network compared to CON. The brain monoamine neurotransmitter levels did not differ in healthy offspring. Perinatal DHA supplementation may increase exploratory behaviors, improve recognition memory, enhance fiber tract integrity, and alter brain functional organization in offspring at weaning.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Prenatal and early postnatal time represent critical periods of brain development sensitive to nutritional status [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) commonly recommended during pregnancy and is widely added to the infant formula due to its suggested beneficial role in visual function and cognitive development [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. DHA accounts for more than 40% of the total n-3 PUFA in the neuronal tissue [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], especially in the gray matter [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the developing brain, the fastest DHA increase takes place during the third trimester of the gestation period, into the postnatal life [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], coinciding with the rapid myelination, dendritic outgrowth, and synaptogenesis [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], highlighting the importance of DHA during the critical window of neurodevelopment. Indeed, the perinatal deprivation of α-linolenic acid (ALA), the precursor of DHA, resulted in a 61% reduction in DHA concentration, a 65% decrease in serotonin (5-HT) levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and disturbed hippocampal (HC)-dependent learning and cognitive behaviors in rats compared to offspring born to ALA-sufficient animals [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Importantly, endogenous DHA synthesis is limited in mammals, and breast milk serves as a high bioavailable source of DHA to infants [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>In humans, compelling evidence from observational studies supports the positive association between maternal fish intake and infant DHA status in neurocognitive development [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, intervention trials supplementing DHA during gestation and/or lactation yielded mixed and conflicting findings in healthy term infants [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For example, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) found that maternal seafood intake higher than 340 g/week is associated with better verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) and a decreased risk of suboptimal fine motor, social development, and communication scores of the children compared to those born to mothers who consumed less than 340 g seafood/week during pregnancy [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, a randomized control trial (RCT) in Australian women found that maternal supplementation of DHA (800 mg/day) during pregnancy did not influence cognitive and language development of infants at 18 months compared to the control group [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly, DHA supplementation (220 mg/day) during gestation until 3 months after delivery did not influence the neurodevelopment of infants when they were evaluated at 18 months of age [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; fish oil supplementation (400 mL/day) from the 28th week of gestation to 4 months lactation did not influence the visual and cognitive/psychomotor development of infants in their first year of life. These conflicting findings urge further exploration into the role of maternal DHA supplementation on the structural and functional organization of the developing brain in healthy subjects.</p>
      <p>Pigs are a robust model for both nutritional and neurodevelopmental research in understanding nutritional programming in the human mother–infant dyad due to a myriad of similarities to humans in physiology, anatomy, pathology, and eating behavior [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Pigs have a gyrencephalic brain [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], unlike mice who are lissencephalic, a key architectural difference that has a direct correlation with brain connectivity and complexity [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The human and swine brain is composed of &gt;60% white matter, while the white matter in the rodent brain is &lt; 10% [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The anatomical similarities in different brain regions, such as the HC [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], subcortical and diencephalic nuclei [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and cortical regions [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] between the pig and human brain have been illustrated. Furthermore, the pig brain exhibits a perinatal growth spurt much like human infants, during which the brain weight grows most rapidly from the last trimester of gestation to lactation [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Pig brain grows most rapidly from about 50 days pre- to 40 days postnatal [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; the cerebrum presents two rapid growth periods between 80–100 days of conception and 6–26 days after birth [<xref rid="B41-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In healthy human infants, the brain volume is around 25% of an adult’s brain at birth and grows rapidly to around 72 and 83% of an adult’s total brain volume at 1 year and 2 years after birth, respectively [<xref rid="B42-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis in pigs revealed that the total brain volume reaches 75% and 95% around 10.7 and 22.07 weeks after birth, respectively [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is estimated that 1 week of piglet age is comparable to 1 month in human infants, and the 3-week-old piglets in this study are estimated to have brain development similar to that seen in human infants of around 3 months of age.</p>
      <p>This is the first study, to our knowledge, that thoroughly examines the effect of perinatal DHA intake on the functional and cognitive development of the brain in piglets. The present study aims to investigate whether maternal supplementation of DHA during late gestation and lactation imparts advantages to cognitive development, fiber bundle maturation, anatomical and functional organization, and the monoamine neurotransmitter status of the developing brain in healthy offspring using a piglet model.</p>

        <title>2.1. Animals and Study Design</title>
        <p>The cross-bred commercial line of healthy pregnant sows (<italic>n</italic> = 8) were obtained from the University of Georgia Swine unit at approximately day 69 of gestation. Sows were assigned to the DHA group (DHA, <italic>n</italic> = 5) or the isocaloric control group (CON, <italic>n</italic> = 3) after accounting for the parity (5.38 ± 0.32) and body weight (BW, 239.7 ± 7.71 kg). After one week of acclimation in a temperature-controlled facility, sows were fed the corresponding diets from day 74 of gestation until delivery and throughout lactation. Approximately one week before expected farrowing, sows were transferred to individually house farrowing crates equipped with heat lamps. From each litter, 2–3 male and female piglets with a BW closest to the average BW were chosen within 24 h to be included in the study (<italic>n</italic> = 14 in CON, <italic>n</italic> = 20 in DHA). At weaning, piglets underwent behavior examinations, and a subset of piglets (<italic>n</italic> = 7 in both CON and DHA) underwent MRI acquisition and were sacrificed at approximately the postnatal day (PND) 20 for tissue collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-12-02090-f001">Figure 1</xref>). This study was conducted per the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines (project code: A2018 04-003-Y2-A8).</p>

        <title>2.2. Dietary Treatment</title>
        <p>Pregnant sows were maintained on a gestation (2 kg/day) and lactation (ad libitum) diet primarily composed of corn with a total of 3300–3330 kcal/kg as recommended by National Research Council (NRC), 2012 [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Sows in the DHA group were supplemented with 75 mg/kg BW/day DHA as algae-produced DHASCO (contains 42.9% DHA, DSM Nutritional Products Inc., Pendergrass, GA, USA) by mixing the oil with the basal diet (<xref rid="nutrients-12-02090-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Poultry fat and corn are the primary sources of fat in the basal diet. The major fatty acids in the basal diet, based on the fatty acid composition of poultry fat and corn [<xref rid="B45-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], are linoleic acid (C18:2n6, LA, approximately 46% in gestation diet and 43% in lactation diet), oleic acid (18:1, approximately 33% in gestation diet and 34% in lactation diet), and palmitic acid (16:0, approximately 13% in gestation and 15% in lactation diet). The current dosage of DHA was chosen based on previous findings that effectively enhances DHA level in sows and piglets and exerts beneficial health effects on the animals [<xref rid="B47-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To determine whether this dose is safe, liver alanine aminotransferase was measured using a clinical chemistry analyzer that confirmed that the current dose did not cause hepatotoxicity.

This is in agreement with the previous findings from humans and pigs that maternal dietary intake of DHA sufficiently modified breast milk DHA and other n-3 PUFAs, such as EPA (C20:5) and DPA (C22:5) levels, while ALA levels remained relatively stable [<xref rid="B62-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Although we did not measure plasma DHA level in the offspring, other studies have shown that supplementing lactating mothers with DHA increased infant plasma and erythrocytes phospholipid DHA levels [<xref rid="B64-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Meanwhile, breastmilk n-6 PUFAs, such as LA (C18:2) and AA (C20:4), were decreased due to dietary DHA supplementation in accordance with previous findings in humans, suggesting that reduced levels of these n-6 PUFAs in breast milk and a decreased n-6/n-3 ratio in infant plasma by DHA supplementation during pregnancy and lactation are likely due to the competitive incorporation of these two PUFAs into the plasma membrane [<xref rid="B66-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p>
      <p>Piglets born to DHA-fed sows demonstrated better cognitive performance in the behavioral testing. The OFT provides a simple and general measure of motor function and exploratory behaviors [<xref rid="B68-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and the ORT measures short-term object recognition memory, which is at least partly hippocampus dependent [<xref rid="B69-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] in an enclosed and undisturbed setting. Previous studies demonstrated that selective hippocampal lesion led to impaired object recognition memory in both human and non-human primates [<xref rid="B70-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B71-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], indicating a critical role of hippocampus in the short-term recognition memory. Additionally, the development of memory ability is suggested to be dependent partly on the progressive development of the hippocampus in a sequence of novelty preference, cognitive recall, flexible memory, and source memory [<xref rid="B72-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Healthy offspring from DHA-fed and CON-fed sows exhibited similar locomotor functions. Interestingly, piglets from DHA-fed sows demonstrated more exploratory behaviors as they spent more time sniffing the walls of the open arena. Dietary intake of n-3-PUFA was found to be associated with increased exploratory behaviors in other models [<xref rid="B73-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B74-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. This may be due to decreased stress and anxiety levels and/or increased visual function of the piglets from the DHA group. In rodents, a low intake of n-3 PUFA reduced exploratory behaviors in young animals and dietary DHA decreases stress and anxiety levels [<xref rid="B74-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B76-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In pigs, postnatal DHA deprivation depleted frontal cortex DHA and increased fear/anxiety-like behavior associated with brain DA levels [<xref rid="B77-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The improved recognition memory formation assessed by ORT is in agreement with previous findings in which preterm piglets supplemented with DHA had increased recognition memory compared to the control [<xref rid="B78-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The fact that the control piglets did not have a preference for the novel object at this stage indicates that a regulatory recommendation for DHA supplementation during neurodevelopment is worth considering. Nevertheless, more data and studies are needed as the memory-improving effect of DHA is widely seen in young adults [<xref rid="B79-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] but not consistently observed in infants [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B80-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. It is worth noting that these human trials commonly used the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence to assess the recognition memory with only visual stimuli [<xref rid="B82-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In comparison, the ORT in animals provides the subjects an opportunity to explore the objects with physical contact. The enhanced exploratory behavior and memory may also be related to the improved visual acuity due to DHA treatment. Human infants fed with a DHA-enriched diet showed accelerated development and maturation of the visual system and better visual function [<xref rid="B83-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="B84-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. We also found increased functional connectivity within the visual network in these piglets, suggesting that the increased curiosity to the surrounding environment and higher engagement during object recognition may be partly due to the advanced development of the visual system.</p>
      <p>MRI such as structural MRI, DTI, and rs-fMRI is increasingly used as a powerful tool to evaluate the role of DHA in the cognitive development of preterm infants. In our study, the perinatal DHA supplementation increased the myelination of axonal bundles in piglets. DTI measures brain microstructure and has been largely used to assess white matter integrity indicated by a reduced FA value [<xref rid="B85-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Children born with very low birth weight had lower FA values in internal and external capsules, corpus callosum, and inferior and superior fasciculus than the control group, which was associated with visual-motor deficits and lower IQ scores [<xref rid="B87-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. A lower FA score was found to be associated with language processing, reading skills, and attention and anxiety behaviors later in life of preterm-born children, and such relation was not observed in full-term infants [<xref rid="B88-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="B89-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Breastfed infants have higher brain DHA concentrations [<xref rid="B90-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], and preterm infants fed exclusively with breastmilk demonstrated greater structural connectivity and higher FA in major white matter fasciculi compared to non-exclusively breastfed infants [<xref rid="B91-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Moreover, postnatal DHA supplementation to premature infants for 9 weeks showed a trend of a higher FA value in the corpus callosum related to control preterm infants at 8 years of age [<xref rid="B92-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. In this study, DTI analysis revealed an increased fiber tract length and a trend of increased FA value, which is in agreement with the previous findings in which higher DTI indices in the HC was seen in DHA-fed preterm pigs [<xref rid="B78-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].</p>
      <p>Resting-state fMRI assesses intrinsic functional connectivity between different neural networks by measuring fluctuations in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal while the subject remains at a resting state without doing any cognitive task [<xref rid="B93-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study investigating the intrinsic RSN changes due to maternal intake of DHA during gestation and lactation. CERE is associated with various fundamental functions, including motor coordination, visuomotor learning, executive function, and memory formation [<xref rid="B94-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,<xref rid="B95-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Higher activity of CERE due to perinatal DHA supplementation is likely to benefit the visual guidance of movement and working memory coinciding with our observations in the behavioral testing. DMN represents the intrinsic and spontaneous neuronal activity associated with internal thought processes and is deactivated during cognitively demanding tasks [<xref rid="B96-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,<xref rid="B97-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Failure of the DMN deactivation is associated with cognitive abnormities [<xref rid="B98-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,<xref rid="B99-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,<xref rid="B100-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. While it is unclear why perinatal DHA supplementation increased DMN activity in piglets, the intervention is likely to pose long-term influences on the cognitive processing and neurodegenerative processes [<xref rid="B101-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Further investigations of maternal DHA supplementation on DMN activity comparing resting and task-based fMRI in infants will be of interest.</p>
      <p>An increased VIS activity with DHA supplementation may indicate the accelerated maturation of the visual system, which underlies the improved visual acuity observed in human trials [<xref rid="B83-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="B84-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="B102-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Term infants are born with adult-like VIS and SMN networks, suggesting prenatal development within these two domains [<xref rid="B103-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. We also found a decreased activity within SMN in piglets born to DHA-fed sows, which may suggest that DHA prevents the activation of SMN at the resting state. Interestingly, in human infants, the rapid development of SMN may occur earlier than the VIS [<xref rid="B104-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], and the within-network connectivity of SMN manifests an age-related decrease during the first two years [<xref rid="B103-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]; this may indicate an increased synaptic and axonal pruning within the sensory and motor cortices and a shift of functional organization towards more specialized cortical networks [<xref rid="B105-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Thus, a decreased functional connectivity within SMN may suggest an enhanced development and maturation of the network that might have resulted from maternal DHA supplementation. Our findings suggest that perinatal DHA supplementation may alter brain functional organization of the offspring and support rs-fMRI as a sensitive tool to assess DHA status on brain functional connectivity and cortical organization in healthy piglets.</p>
      <p>Monoamine neurotransmitters are critical neurochemicals for the proper function of learning, memory, and emotions [<xref rid="B106-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Dietary <italic>n</italic> = 3-PUFA deficiency drastically decreased DA level and increased the 5-HT2 receptor in the PFC of young animals [<xref rid="B107-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. In piglets, postnatal DHA and AA supplementation to ALA/LA-deficient animals increased DA, 5-HT, and NE in the frontal cortex [<xref rid="B108-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Perinatal ALA deficiency decreased tyrosine hydroxylase level, the rate-limiting enzyme for DA synthesis, in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area of the dopaminergic pathway [<xref rid="B109-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] and increased 5-HT turnover in the PFC in rats [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We found that during a healthy pregnancy, maternal DHA supplementation resulted in an insignificant increase in DA, 5-HT, and NE in the HC of the offspring. It will be of interest to determine whether perinatal DHA intake influences neurotransmitters with a larger sample size.</p>
      <p>This is the first study to provide evidence for improvement in cognition and brain development with perinatal DHA supplementation in piglets. However, there are a few limitations to this study. A small sample size, though statistically enough, may have limited our power to detect the true effect of perinatal DHA supplementation in piglets and increased the error due to the random effects, including sow effects. The maternal factor was controlled in statistical analysis by including sow as a random effect using the mixed-effect linear model. Additionally, the present study used safflower oil as a control oil, which is high in n-6 PUFA. Thus, the observed changes may be ascribed in part to the high n-6 intake in the control animals. Although n-6-rich components like safflower oil are commonly used in the control diets to match the caloric intake between the control and test groups, safflower oil is low in oleic acid, which is the main fatty acid of myelin and could potentially influence myelination and brain functional connectivity during development [<xref rid="B110-nutrients-12-02090" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Finally, the current study measured fMRI when the animals were at resting state. While it provided valuable insights into the resting-state networks influenced by the treatment, it is challenging to interpret due to its novel application in infant piglets. Future studies integrating both resting-state and task-based fMRI in a larger sample size would be of interest.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>In conclusion, the present data provides preclinical support that the maternal DHA supplementation during late gestation and lactation may increase exploratory behavior, improve memory function, enhance fiber tract integrity, and alter brain functional organization of offspring at weaning without affecting the volume of major brain structures.</p>
