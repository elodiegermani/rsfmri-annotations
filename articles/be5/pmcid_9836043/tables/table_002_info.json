{"table_id": "T3", "table_label": "Table 3:", "table_caption": "Mean functional connectivity parameter estimates for HC and OUD. Mean parameter estimates for the statistically significant cluster in the LECN with weaker functional connectivity in OUD relative to HC. The parameter estimate (beta value) of the regression coefficient at each voxel constitutes the subject-specific spatial map of relative functional connectivity across the network. The functional connectivity parameter estimates at each voxel are the output of stage 2 of the Dual Regression procedure and quantitatively represent the relative magnitude of functional connectivity of a given voxel with the subject specific fMRI timecourse that is characteristic of the entire network. T-statistic and p-value are the mean T-statistic and p-value, respectively, across the cluster. p-value is FWE-corrected for the number of voxels in the brain, contrasts (OUD>HC and HC>OUD), and number of networks examined (4).", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_002.csv"}
