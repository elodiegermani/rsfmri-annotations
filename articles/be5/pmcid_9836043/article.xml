          <title>Objective:</title>
          <p id="P3">Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity has been used as a tool to study brain mechanisms associated with addictions. Recent research in substance use disorders has focused on three brain networks termed the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN). The purpose of this study was to examine the functional connectivity of those three networks in opioid use disorder (OUD) subjects compared to healthy control subjects (HC).</p>

          <title>Methods:</title>
          <p id="P4">The present study investigated functional connectivity differences between OUD subjects compared to HC using independent component analysis. This study also examined the relationship between functional connectivity and negative urgency scores, as well as compared the functional connectivity of severe OUD to mild or moderate OUD.</p>

          <title>Results:</title>
          <p id="P5">In OUD subjects (n=25) compared to HC (n=25), a cluster in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex within the left ECN had significantly weaker functional connectivity. No significant differences were found between groups for the functional connectivity of the DMN, SN, or right ECN. No significant associations were found between functional connectivity and negative urgency, and no differences were found between severe OUD and mild or moderate OUD.</p>

          <title>Conclusion:</title>
          <p id="P6">These novel preliminary results suggest that ECN functional connectivity may differ between OUD and HC. This finding is consistent with previous research showing altered executive function in OUD and supports further examination of ECN functional connectivity in association with treatment response in OUD. Given our relatively small sample size (50 subjects total; 25 subjects per group), our results should be treated as preliminary for hypothesis generation, and replication will be needed in future studies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P7">Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) represents a significant public health issue, and there remains room for improvement in the understanding of the neurobiology underlying OUD. Among the tools used for studying OUD neurobiology are functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of brain neural functional connectivity. Functional connectivity measures the statistical dependence between brain regions of spontaneous fluctuations in the fMRI signal [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Resting state fMRI functional connectivity can provide information about how the brain is organized into functional networks and how those functional networks may differ in OUD. Zhang and Volkow (2019) have reviewed the addiction functional connectivity literature with focus on the Default Mode Network (DMN). That review reported differences in substance users’ functional connectivity within sub-systems of the DMN and between the DMN and other networks, such as the Salience Network (SN) and the Executive Control Network (ECN) [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The DMN, SN, and ECN are three networks possibly related to addiction and psychopathology in general [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has been suggested that functional connectivity within and among the DMN, SN, and ECN is altered in substance use disorders, possibly reflecting salient environmental cues (SN) interacting more with circuits associated with craving (DMN) and less with circuits associated with executive control (ECN) [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
      <p id="P8">Several studies of OUD have assessed functional connectivity within the DMN, with inconsistent findings. While several studies found decreased functional connectivity within the DMN, some studies found increased functional connectivity [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Fewer studies have assessed functional connectivity within the SN and ECN [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Both Upadhyay et al. (2010) and Wang et al. (2016) found decreased functional connectivity within the SN in OUD subjects relative to healthy controls. Li et al. (2018) found increased functional connectivity between the left ECN and the right ECN in OUD, but to our knowledge there are no published studies which have addressed functional connectivity within the left ECN or right ECN in OUD [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, many of the above-referenced studies used seed-based functional connectivity methods which may be more prone to head motion confounds than independent component analysis (ICA) [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ICA allows for quantitative investigation of whole networks without the need for selection of a seed region of interest and can better account for artifacts compared to seed-based methods which can be influenced by spatial confounds [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ICA with subsequent analysis using the dual regression module of FSL software (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/" ext-link-type="uri">www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/</ext-link>) considers both amplitude and shape of the signal time-course of resting state networks [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Head motion can mimic amplitude effects, and dual regression can more accurately localize these amplitude effects of motion and thus avoid misinterpreting them as differences in connectivity [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
      <p id="P9">The present study used ICA to test for functional connectivity differences between OUD subjects and non-drug using healthy control subjects (HC) within the DMN, SN, and ECN. Previous research using ICA has shown the ECN to be lateralized as left ECN (LECN) and right ECN (RECN) components, and therefore we studied both LECN and RECN components in our ICA analysis [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The present study also tested for associations of functional connectivity with negative urgency scores (NU) across all subjects. NU is an aspect of impulsivity, which has been linked to executive control, and is described as the tendency to act rashly in response to negative affect [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. NU has been associated with greater opioid use and future opioid use in a chronic pain patient sample, but has not yet been studied in association with functional connectivity in OUD [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
      <p id="P10">We hypothesized that OUD subjects would have lower within-network DMN and lower within-network SN functional connectivity relative to HC, based on previous findings in OUD individuals who were actively using illicit opioids and/or taking methadone or buprenorphine [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We hypothesized that OUD subjects would score higher in NU, similar to previous findings in opioid users and other substance users [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We also hypothesized that NU scores would negatively correlate with SN functional connectivity of both groups based on a previous study using tobacco users and the proposed associations of the SN with salience detection and evaluation [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We also performed exploratory analyses of associations between NU scores and the within-network functional connectivity of the DMN, LECN, and RECN. We also planned exploratory analyses to compare between groups the within-network functional connectivity of the LECN and RECN. All of these hypotheses were registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF) prior to any data analysis in this study [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The present study also compared post-hoc the functional connectivity of OUD subjects with different levels of OUD severity. To investigate the effects of heterogeneity of our OUD sample, we also performed post-hoc analyses of functional connectivity of OUD with urine drug screens positive for buprenorphine or methadone compared to OUD with urine drug screens positive only for illicit opioids. Also, to investigate the effects of heterogeneity, we examined the relationship between functional connectivity and time since last opioid use in the OUD subjects. Given our relatively small sample size (50 subjects total; 25 subjects per group), our results should be treated as preliminary for hypothesis generation, and replication will be needed in future studies.</p>

        <title>Subjects and procedures</title>
        <p id="P11">All study procedures were approved by the Virginia Commonwealth University Institutional Review Board. OUD subjects were recruited from the Richmond, Virginia, community outpatient setting by using flyers and in-person recruitment at addiction treatment clinics. To obtain a more representative sample of the OUD population that could be seen clinically, no restrictions regarding current drug use were imposed during recruitment. HC subjects were recruited by using flyers and other advertisements. Written informed consent and a thorough screening were obtained, including a medical history, physical examination, and psychiatric and substance use histories conducted using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version 5 (DSM-5) [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Inclusion criteria were DSM-5 diagnosed OUD (for OUD only) and age between 18 and 70 years. Exclusion criteria were any history of schizophrenia, seizure disorder, significant head trauma, any changes to psychoactive medications within 30 days prior to the study period, any other DSM-5 Substance Use Disorder with a severity diagnosis greater than the subject’s DSM-5 OUD severity diagnosis (Mild, Moderate, Severe), or DSM-5 Severe Alcohol Use Disorder. In addition, HC subject exclusion criteria were any history of substance use disorder. Subjects were seen for a screening visit and three additional visits in which they completed several behavioral measures, an MRI screening and mock MRI session, and an MRI scan. Participants were asked to refrain from smoking 1 hour before and drinking caffeine 3 hours before their MRI scan. Urine drug screens (UDS) and alcohol breath screens were obtained during each visit. 25 OUD and 25 HC subjects were included in the final analysis.

        <title>MRI preprocessing</title>
        <p id="P18">Initial removal of signal outliers, heart rate physiologic noise correction, slice timing correction, spatial smoothing, and registration to a T1 anatomical scan were performed. Susceptibility-induced off-resonance field correction was conducted by FSL “topup” software (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/" ext-link-type="uri">www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/</ext-link>). Quality control for head motion was performed by eliminating fMRI runs which did not meet the Parkes et al. (2018) stringent criteria [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Head motion re-alignment and signal correction was performed using the FSL MCFLIRT motion-correction program and ICA-AROMA, respectively [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Further denoising was performed using the aCompCor procedure implemented in CONN software (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ni-trc.org/projects/conn" ext-link-type="uri">www.ni-trc.org/projects/conn</ext-link>, RRID:SCR_009550), and ICA components with possible motion-related structured noise are regressed out during the FSL dual regression procedure [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The denoised fMRI timeseries was transformed into MNI space. High pass filtering (cutoff=125 s), but not low pass filtering, was performed. Greater detail in the preprocessing steps is presented in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File</xref>.</p>

        <title>Functional connectivity analysis</title>
        <p id="P19">Group ICA maps were created using all subjects in both groups by FSL MELODIC (Multivariate Exploratory Linear Decomposition into Independent Components) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/ME-LODIC" ext-link-type="uri">https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/ME-LODIC</ext-link>) with 30 components, the output of which was visually inspected to identify the DMN, SN, LECN, and RECN networks [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Dual regression analysis was then performed in FSL to obtain the subject-specific component maps of parameter estimates of functional connectivity, which were then used as the input to non-parametric permutations statistical tests using FSL’s Permutation Analysis of Linear Models (PALM) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM" ext-link-type="uri">https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM</ext-link>) for comparison between groups [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The FSL standard Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) was used to identify statistically significant clusters of voxels while maintaining family-wise-error (FWE) control [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We analyzed the regression of the subject-specific functional connectivity on NU scores for all subjects in both groups, and we also compared the functional connectivity of subjects with severe OUD to subjects with mild or moderate OUD. All reported p-values of functional connectivity results are FWE corrected for the number of voxels, the number of contrasts, and the 4 networks examined.</p>
        <p id="P20">To examine the effects of heterogeneity in our OUD sample, we also performed two post-hoc analyses. In the first analysis, we compared OUD subjects with at least one UDS positive for buprenorphine or methadone to OUD subjects with UDS positive for illicit opioids only. In the second analysis, we analyzed the regression of the subject-specific functional connectivity on self-reported time since last opioid use, measured in hours.</p>
        <p id="P21">For baseline variables (NU, education, and mean framewise displacement (mFD)) that statistically significantly differed between the two groups, we conducted a preliminary analysis of the regression of functional connectivity on the baseline variable to determine whether that variable should be included as a covariate in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) based on recommendations from a standard statistics textbook [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Given that 17/25 OUD subjects were tobacco users while 0/25 HC subjects were tobacco users, we were unable to perform ANCOVA but instead compared the functional connectivity of tobacco using OUD subjects to non-tobacco using OUD subjects.</p>

As displayed in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, dual regression analysis showed that the OUD group had significantly weaker within-network functional connectivity relative to HC in a cluster (30 voxels; cluster peak at MNI coordinates (x=−16, y=19, z=52) mm) within the LECN (Cohen’s d=1.455, p=0.022 after FWE correction for voxels, contrasts, and the 4 networks examined).

According to the histological study of Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic (1995), the entire cluster was within the coordinates of their broadly defined dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), with approximately half of the voxels in the cluster falling within their conservatively defined dlPFC [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The mean functional connectivity parameter estimates output from stage 2 of the Dual Regression procedure for HC and OUD are listed in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P31">Our results provide preliminary evidence that LECN functional connectivity may be weaker in OUD subjects compared to HC subjects. Differences in LECN resting state fMRI functional connectivity have been shown in cocaine use disorder and alcohol use disorder subjects relative to controls, but to our knowledge, this is the first published study to show differences in LECN resting state fMRI functional connectivity in OUD relative to HC [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These results need to be replicated, but if LECN functional connectivity can be shown to consistently differ in OUD subjects compared to HC, it may represent a neurobiological underpinning of impaired executive functioning observed in OUD [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Future studies should examine the association between LECN functional connectivity and addiction-related behaviors and treatment response in OUD.</p>
      <p id="P32">The ECN is proposed to play a role in executing goal-directed behavior. Dysfunction in the ECN has been linked to multiple psychopathologies, including substance use disorders [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Reese et al. (2019) found weaker functional connectivity within the LECN in cocaine use disorder subjects compared to healthy controls [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Two studies found contrasting results in alcohol use disorder – Weiland et al. (2014) found weaker functional connectivity within the LECN in alcohol use disorder subjects relative to healthy controls, while Zhu et al. (2017) found stronger functional connectivity in the LECN in alcohol use disorder subjects relative to healthy controls [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The opposing findings of Zhu et al. (2017) may be because their reported region within the LECN with increased functional connectivity was in the left posterior parietal cortex, while the region with significantly weaker LECN functional connectivity from our study was in the left dlPFC [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although both Reese et al. (2019) and Weiland et al. (2014) found weaker functional connectivity in the LECN, they did not report which specific region within the LECN showed decreased functional connectivity [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
      <p id="P33">The dlPFC node within the ECN has been proposed to play a key role in directing and sustaining attention during goal directed behavior and working memory [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. While there is currently no universally accepted interpretation of stronger or weaker resting state fMRI functional connectivity, one suggestion proposed by some of the authors of the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) is that weaker within-network functional connectivity in a given set of voxels or regions may reflect weaker synchrony with the processes of a given network [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While speculative, weaker functional connectivity of the dlPFC within the LECN may be related to impaired recruitment of the dlPFC within the LECN during the initiation of goal directed behavior. This impaired recruitment may relate to the impaired attentional control and impulsivity found in substance use disorders [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Executive control deficits in OUD have been well documented and may be partially improved by drug abstinence and medication therapies [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. If ECN functional connectivity is shown to relate to executive control deficits in OUD, it may serve as a target for OUD treatment studies.</p>
      <p id="P34">Impulsivity is proposed to relate to increased substance use by an increased proclivity to act on the immediate reward associated with substance use without consideration of the long-term consequences of substance use [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. NU may be related to increased drug use because of susceptibility to impulsive action in response to the stress of drug withdrawal and craving [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the results in the present study do not support a significant association between NU and functional connectivity of the LECN. It is possible that our sample size was too small to detect a subtle association between LECN functional connectivity and NU. Future work should further investigate whether LECN functional connectivity is associated with impulsivity and executive control task performance in larger samples of HC and OUD subjects.</p>
      <p id="P35">DMN functional connectivity did not differ between groups. The lack of a significant difference in DMN functional connectivity may be related to previous findings suggesting that DMN functional connectivity may be influenced by recent drug use, although recency of last opioid use was unrelated to DMN functional connectivity in our post-hoc analysis [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is also possible that different sub-systems and sub-regions of the DMN may be differentially affected by chronic drug use [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Our findings also showed that SN and RECN functional connectivity did not differ between OUD and HC, and we were unable to find previous published studies using ICA that compared OUD and HC within these networks. Our results do not support any statistically significant differences in functional connectivity of any of the 4 networks examined between severe OUD and mild or moderate OUD subgroups, although this subgroup analysis was underpowered due to small subgroup sample size.</p>
      <p id="P36">All but 2 of the OUD subjects in this study were current users according to their DSM-5 diagnosis, and therefore this study was unable to compare former opioid users with current opioid users. Future studies should include subjects with past OUD to compare the effects of former vs. current OUD on network connectivity. On the other hand, the time since last opioid use was analyzed in the present study and showed no significant effects on functional connectivity in the networks analyzed. We also compared OUD subjects who were UDS positive for buprenorphine or methadone with OUD subjects who were UDS positive for only illicit opioids and found no statistically significant differences between the two subgroups. However, this subgroup analysis was also underpowered because of small subgroup sample size.</p>

      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p id="P37">A limitation of our study was the relatively small sample size. Recent research has highlighted the importance of large sample sizes in promoting reliability and reproducibility of resting state fMRI research [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Given our relatively small sample size, our results should be interpreted with caution and treated as preliminary for hypothesis generation. Replication of our results is needed. Another limitation of our study was the heterogeneity of our OUD sample. While our heterogenous OUD sample may be more representative of the OUD population, it is unclear exactly how differences in treatment adherence, recency of drug use, and polysubstance use may influence functional connectivity. Future studies with larger sample sizes should examine the effects of these factors systematically. Additionally, our sample size was underpowered to determine group interactions with sex; further work is needed to analyze the influence of sex on functional connectivity in OUD. Additionally, there was a range of time lag between the date of assessment of OUD severity and the date of the MRI scan that may have led to inaccuracy in estimating the actual OUD severity at the time of the scan.</p>
      <p id="P38">Another limitation is that the OUD group had significantly higher mFD, education, and NU than the HC group. However, the mFD difference between groups was only 0.03 mm, and all subjects in both groups met the stringent motion criteria for inclusion in the analysis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File</xref>) [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, the effects of head motion on the fMRI signal had been corrected with the CompCor method and the ICAAROMA method, and ICA components with possible motion-related structured noise are regressed out during the dual regression procedure [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Despite all of these correction procedures and the very small difference in head motion between groups, it is crucial to rule out variations in head motion as driving group differences in functional connectivity, and if there are group differences in head motion, then investigators should perform a check whether motion is correlated with functional connectivity in their study [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In our sample, when conducting this check, there was no statistically significant correlation between mFD and functional connectivity in any of the 4 networks analyzed. Education and NU were also not statistically significantly related to the functional connectivity of any of the 4 networks analyzed. Another limitation is that 16 of the OUD subjects were tobacco users while none of our HC subjects were tobacco users. Tobacco-using OUD subjects did not statistically significantly differ from non-tobacco-using OUD subjects in functional connectivity of any of the 4 networks analyzed, although this analysis was underpowered. Future studies comparing OUD to HC should aim to balance subject groups for years of education attained, NU, and tobacco use. Due to the small sample size, difference in baseline demographic variables between OUD and HC subjects, and heterogeneity in drug use and treatment status in the OUD subjects, our results should be interpreted with caution and treated as preliminary. Furthermore, our results do not provide evidence regarding any specific behavioral correlates of the weaker LECN resting state fMRI functional connectivity in OUD relative to HC. Future studies should examine the addiction-related behavioral associations of LECN functional connectivity differences between OUD and HC.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p id="P39">These novel preliminary results suggest that ECN functional connectivity may differ between OUD and HC. This finding is consistent with previous research showing altered executive function in OUD and supports further examination of ECN functional connectivity in association with treatment response in OUD. Given our relatively small sample size (50 subjects total; 25 subjects per group), the statistically significant difference in demographic variables between groups, and the heterogeneity within our OUD group, our results should be treated as preliminary for hypothesis generation. Replication of these results will be needed in future studies.</p>

Mean parameter estimates for the statistically significant cluster in the LECN with weaker functional connectivity in OUD relative to HC. The parameter estimate (beta value) of the regression coefficient at each voxel constitutes the subject-specific spatial map of relative functional connectivity across the network. The functional connectivity parameter estimates at each voxel are the output of stage 2 of the Dual Regression procedure and quantitatively represent the relative magnitude of functional connectivity of a given voxel with the subject specific fMRI timecourse that is characteristic of the entire network. T-statistic and p-value are the mean T-statistic and p-value, respectively, across the cluster. p-value is FWE-corrected for the number of voxels in the brain, contrasts (OUD&gt;HC and HC&gt;OUD), and number of networks examined (4).</p>
