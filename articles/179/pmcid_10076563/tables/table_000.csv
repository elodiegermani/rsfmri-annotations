GSchange,"The global signal change timeseries is computed as the absolute value of the scan-to-scan change in global BOLD signal, computed separately at each scan/timepoint and scaled to standard units within each run.",0 < x < ∞. Higher values indicate higher sudden variability in signal intensity.
FD,"The framewise displacement timeseries is computed as the maximum change in the position of six control points placed at the center of a bounding box around the brain, computed separately at each scan/timepoint.",0 < x < ∞. Higher values indicate higher sudden displacements in head position.
Scrubbing,"The scrubbing covariate contains one separate timeseries per identified outlier scan. Each of these timeseries contain a single 1-value at the identified scan, and 0-values at all other timepoints. They are computed by thresholding GSchange and FD at the desired values.","x ∈ {0,1}. 1 indicates a scan identified as a potential outlier"
Realignment,"The realignment covariate contains six timeseries, three characterizing head translations along the x/y/z directions in mm units, and three characterizing rotations around the x/y/z axes in radians.",-∞ < x < ∞. Higher absolute values indicate larger relative motion between a scan compared to the first scan within the same run
WM,"The WM covariate contains multiple timeseries, characterizing the principal components of the BOLD signal within white matter areas, sorted by decreasing variance.",-∞ < x < ∞. Higher absolute values indicate larger departures from the average BOLD signal within WM
CSF,"The CSF covariate contains multiple timeseries, characterizing the principal components of the BOLD signal within cerebrospinal fluid tissue areas, sorted by decreasing variance.",-∞ < x < ∞. Higher absolute values indicate larger departures from the average BOLD signal within CSF

MaxMotion,"The maximum of motion is the maximum value of the FD timeserie from each run, calculated considering all original scans.",0 < x < ∞. Higher values indicate more extreme motion spikes.
InvalidScans,Invalid scans is the number of scans identified as outliers during outlier detection based on scan-to-scan GS and framewise displacement change.,0 < x < total number of scans. Higher values indicate higher presence of potential outlier scans.
ValidScans,Valid scans is the number of valid or non-outlier scans.,0 < x < total number of scans. Lower values indicate fewer surviving scans.
PVS,"The proportion of valid scans is the ratio between non-outlier scans to all scans, representing a normalized measure of valid scans in the presence of potential differences in scanning lengths.",0 < x < 1. Lower values indicate higher presence of potential outlier scans.
MeanGSchange,"The mean global signal change is the mean value of GSchange timeseries, calculated by aggregating GSchange across non-outlier scans only.",-∞ < x < ∞. Higher values indicate higher residual variability in the global signal after scrubbing
MeanMotion,"The mean motion is the mean value of the FD timeseries, calculated by aggregating FD across non-outlier scans only.",0 < x < ∞. Higher values indicate higher residual motion after scrubbing.
NORMfunc,The normalized space to functional accuracy is the Dice similarity coefficient between the IXI-549 MNI-space gray matter tissue mask thresholded at a 25% probability level and the binarized GM masks derived from the functional data and thresholded at a level that produced the same number of suprathreshold voxels as in the MNI-space mask.,0 < x < 1. Lower values indicate a worse normalization of functional data.
NORManat,The normalized space to anatomical accuracy is calculated similarly to NORMfunc but it compares the IXI-549 gray matter mask to the binarized GM mask derived from the anatomical data instead.,0 < x < 1. Lower values represent worse normalization of anatomical data.
AFO,"The anatomical-to-functional overlap is the Dice similarity coefficient between the anatomical gray matter mask, thresholded at a 50% probability level, and the functional gray matter mask, thresholded at a level that resulted in the same number of suprathreshold voxels.",0 < x < 1. Lower values represent a worse inter-modality coregistration.
tissue_vol,"The gray matter, white matter, or cerebrospinal fluid tissue volumes is the count of voxels with tissue-specific probability >50% from participant-specific segmented anatomical tissue ROIs.",0 < x < ∞. Extreme values indicate a combination of individual anatomical differences and normalization performance.
tissue_eroded_vol,The tissue eroded volume is the count of voxels in the tissue-specific ROIS resulting from anatomical segmentation after a 1-voxel erosion procedure.,0 < x < ∞. Extreme values indicate a combination of individual anatomical differences and normalization performance.
DOF,"The effective degrees of freedom are calculated as the total number of scans minus the number of regressors involved in the denoising’s linear regression step, multiplied by the fraction of the Nyquist frequency covered by denoising’s band-pass frequency filter.",-∞ < x < all original scans. Lower values indicate potential lack of precision when estimating modeled effects in the BOLD signal.

BOLDstd,"The BOLD standard deviation is the temporal standard deviation of the BOLD signal, after grand-mean scaling to 100 across the entire brain and denoising, averaged across all runs and all voxels in the analysis mask.","0 < x < ∞. High values may indicate the presence of potential noise, while values close to 0 may indicate lack of retained signal."
GCOR,The mean global correlation (???) is the average of Pearson’s r correlation coefficients between the denoised BOLD timeseries of all pairs of voxels within the analysis mask.,-∞ < x < ∞. High absolute values may indicate the presence of residual noise sources in the BOLD signal.
QC-FC %,"Quality Control to Functional Connectivity distributions (???) represent the observed distribution of correlations across participants between individual QC measures and functional connectivity strength (edges in a fixed graph of 1,000 random voxels within the MNI-space gray matter template mask). QC-FC % match level represents the distance between these observed distributions and those that could be expected by chance, as computed using permutation analyses.",0% < x < 100%. Values above 95% indicate negligible modulations associated with nuisance factors in the correlation structure of the BOLD signal.
