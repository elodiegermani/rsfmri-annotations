MNI coordinates of the brain regions were significantly less active in subjects with BID than in healthy subjects during the tactile stimulation of the body parts (controls > participants with BID). Brain region (R = right hemisphere; L = left hemisphere), cluster size (k = number of voxels), cluster-wise FWER-corrected p-value and uncorrected p-value, voxel-wise (peak level) Z-score and Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates are reported. # Statistical threshold p < 0.05 whole-brain FWER-corrected voxelwise (peak level). BA = Brodmann Areas; corr = corrected. Cluster 3 is reported because it corresponds to the superior parietal lobule of reduced connectivity and grey matter density of Saetta et al. [28]. The left precentral peak of cluster 2 includes the precentral area of reduced grey matter density reported in Saetta et al.
