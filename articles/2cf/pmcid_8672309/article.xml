      <abstract>
        <p><bold>Background:</bold> Post-stroke aphasia (PSA) results from brain network disorders caused by focal stroke lesions. However, it still remains largely unclear whether the impairment is present in intra- and internetwork functional connectivity (FC) within each resting-state network (RSN) and between RSNs in the subacute stage of PSA.</p>
        <p><bold>Objectives:</bold> This study aimed to investigate the resting-state FC within and between RSNs in patients with PSA and observe the relationships between FC alterations and Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) measures.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 20 individuals with subacute PSA and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for functional MRI (fMRI) scanning, and only patients with PSA underwent WAB assessment. Independent component analysis was carried out to identify RSNs. Two-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests were used to calculate intra- and internetwork FC differences between patients with PSA and HCs. The results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR correction, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Partial correlation analysis was performed to observe the relationship between FC and WAB scores with age, gender, mean framewise displacement, and lesion volume as covariates (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> Compared to HCs, patients with PSA showed a significant increase in intranetwork FC in the salience network (SN). For internetwork FC analysis, patients showed a significantly increased coupling between left frontoparietal network (lFPN) and SN and decreased coupling between lFPN and right frontoparietal network (rFPN) as well as between lFPN and posterior default mode network (pDMN) (FDR correction, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Finally, a significant positive correlation was found between the intergroup difference of FC (lFPN-rFPN) and auditory-verbal comprehension (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Altered FC was revealed within and between multiple RSNs in patients with PSA at the subacute stage. Reduced FC between lFPN and rFPN was the key element participating in language destruction. These findings proved that PSA is a brain network disorder caused by focal lesions; besides, it may improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of patients with PSA at the subacute stage.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Post-stroke aphasia (PSA) is a clinical syndrome originating from the damage of language ability and comprehension due to localized stroke lesions (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Thiel and Zumbansen, 2016</xref>). Language function remodeling in PSA is characterized by temporal and spatial variability (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Stefaniak et al., 2020</xref>). The reperfusion and inflammatory response of the perilesional tissue largely disappears in the subacute phase of PSA, and the brain is considered to be in a relatively more stable state than in the acute stage (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Boyd et al., 2017</xref>); this is also an effective therapeutic window for speech rehabilitation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brady et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fridriksson and Hillis, 2021</xref>). Therefore, understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of the subacute stage of PSA is very important for aphasia treatment, as the field moves from standardized therapies toward more targeted individualized treatment strategies (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Thiel and Zumbansen, 2016</xref>).</p>
      <p>The brain is a complex network composed of multiple subnetworks supporting different functional properties (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Shirer et al., 2012</xref>). Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is an established tool to explore intrinsic brain activity non-invasively and effectively, and it has been widely used in neuropsychiatric diseases (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Regional brain activity-based rs-fMRI analysis of patients with PSA (i.e., stroke occurred in the left hemisphere) showed decreased local synchronization in multiple brain areas of the left hemisphere (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Functional connectivity (FC)-based rs-fMRI analysis has been used to evaluate the interaction between language network and the whole brain in patients with PSA, with impressive findings (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). A study by <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Balaev et al. (2016)</xref> reported that FC in multiple subnetworks was demonstrated to be disrupted in patients with PSA, by using independent component analysis (ICA).</p>
      <p>Previous studies summarized that PSA showed a three-phase model of dynamic functional organization (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Nenert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Stockert et al., 2020</xref>), such as decreased global brain activation in the acute phase, increased activation in bilateral domain-general networks and perilesional cortex during the subacute phase, and subsequent normalization of language-related areas in the chronic phase. It was also proved that focal stroke lesions can affect the functional organization of a certain subnetwork and disrupt the internetwork FC between these subnetworks (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Wang C. et al., 2014</xref>). However, neither regional brain activity-based analysis nor FC-based analysis of the whole brain network can provide the complete picture of intra- and internetwork FC of the subnetworks in patients with PSA.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, no study so far has evaluated the intra- and internetwork FC of the whole brain to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms of PSA at the subacute stage. As a multivariate data-driven analysis method, ICA can identify multiple resting-state networks (RSNs) and investigate both intra- and internetwork FC <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Wang D. et al., 2014</xref>). ICA has been previously applied to analyze intra- and internetwork FC in many neurological and psychiatric disorders (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Jafri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2013</xref>). We performed the ICA of rs-fMRI data to investigate the intra- and internetwork FC between patients with PSA at the subacute stage and healthy controls (HCs). It is hoped that this study can likely improve our understanding of the potential pathophysiological mechanism of PSA at the subacute stage.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>A convenience sample of 20 hospitalized patients with PSA were recruited in this study. All patients were right-handed native speakers and were evaluated by MRI scanning and Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) testing 1 month after stroke. All stroke lesions were located in the left middle cerebral artery blood supply area (refer to <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> for the lesion overlap map). None of the patients received language-related therapy. No severe cerebral white matter lesion was revealed through conventional MRI. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) MRI revealed other lesions in the brain parenchyma, such as intracranial hemangioma or tumor; (ii) history of head trauma or mental illness; and (iii) presence of metal in the body as a contraindication to MRI scanning. All patients underwent routine medical treatment, and none of them received any other relevant interventions. Of note, 20 healthy, age-, and gender-matched volunteers with right-handed were selected as HCs for this study. The inclusion criteria for HCs were as follows: (i) absence of any signs and symptoms of neurological disorders and (ii) no history of the long-term use of drugs that could affect the nervous system. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) neurological disorders or family history of genetic disorders and (ii) poor quality of acquired MRI images.</p>

        <title>MRI Data Acquisition</title>
        <p>A 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner (GE Medical Systems, Signa HD, Waukesha, WI, United States) with an eight-channel head coil was used to scan all participants. To minimize head motion, the head of an individual was stabilized with comfortable foam pads, and all subjects wore earplugs to reduce the noise during MRI scanning. 3D-T1 BRAVO sequence was used to acquire a high-resolution T1-weighted image (T1WI) for the whole brain with a repetition time (TR) = 7 ms; echo time (TE) = 3 ms; field of view (FOV) = 256 mm × 256 mm; number of slices = 192; flip angle = 12°; and isotropic spatial resolution = 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm. Then, resting blood oxygen level-dependent images were acquired using an echo-planar imaging sequence. The scanning parameters were as follows: TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms; FOV = 220 mm × 220 mm; slice thickness = 3 mm; slice gap = 1 mm; voxel size = 3.4 mm × 3.4 mm × 4.0 mm; number of slices = 36; flip angle = 90°; and total volume of each subject = 185.</p>

        <title>Lesion Mapping</title>
        <p>The lesion of each patient was manually delineated by two radiologists (KY and YX) on individual high-resolution T1WI images using ITK-SNAP<sup><xref rid="footnote1" ref-type="fn">1</xref></sup> (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yushkevich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, we obtained two values for each lesion volume, which were automatically generated by ITK-SNAP. Weighted kappa (κ) statistics were used to assess interobserver agreement for lesion delineation. Finally, each individual volume obtained from each radiologist was averaged as the final result for each patient.</p>

        <title>Resting-State Functional MRI Data Preprocessing</title>
        <p>A graph theoretical network analysis toolbox for imaging connectomics (GRETNA)<sup><xref rid="footnote2" ref-type="fn">2</xref></sup> was used to perform data preprocessing (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The steps used are outlined as follows: (i) the first 10 time points of each subject were removed; (ii) slice timing was used to correct time differences on the remaining 175 volumes; and (iii) realigning was used to correct individual-level head motion through a Friston-24 model, i.e., any subject with a head maximum displacement &gt; 2 mm, maximum rotation &gt;2.0°, or mean framewise displacement (FD) &gt;0.3 was excluded from the study (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). To further minimize the potential influences of head motion, mean FD was set as a covariate for further second-level statistics (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Satterthwaite et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequently, the individual structural images were segmented and normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space by using a “clinical toolbox” in Statistical Parametric Mapping version 12 (SPM12) software<sup><xref rid="footnote3" ref-type="fn">3</xref></sup> implemented in MATLAB R2013b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, United States), which employed a cost-function modification to exclude the lesion area, avoiding bias during spatial normalization (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brett et al., 2001</xref>). This process has been widely used in other studies (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Stebbins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). The motion-corrected functional imaging data were normalized to MNI space using these transformation parameters and resampled to a voxel size of 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm. The functional volumes were spatially smoothed with Gaussian kernel 6-mm full-width-at-half-maximum.</p>

The procedures included the following steps: (i) data reduction was performed through principal component analysis; (ii) the number of independent components (ICs) was automatically estimated using the minimum description length; (iii) the InfoMax algorithm was utilized for the group analysis of ICA. To ensure the stability of estimation, this algorithm was repeated 100 times in ICASSO, and the most central run was selected and analyzed further; and (iv) back reconstruction for individual-level components (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Erhardt et al., 2011</xref>). Each component for the maps of all participants was evaluated by a random-effect one-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test using a family-wise error correction (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) through SPM12 software implemented in MATLAB R2013b and an extent threshold of 50 voxels (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we carried out ICA and followed by intra- and internetwork analysis to compare resting-state spontaneous brain activity in patients with PSA at the subacute stage and the HCs. We found the following results: (i) significant differences in intra- and internetwork FC between patients with PSA and HCs; (ii) decreased coupling between lFPN and rFPN was significantly correlated with auditory-verbal comprehension of WAB; and (iii) no significant relationship was noted between intranetwork FC and WAB assessment.</p>
      <sec id="S5.SS1">
        <title>Altered Functional Connectivity Within Resting-State Network</title>
        <p>We found that the intranetwork FC of SN was enhanced in patients with PSA when compared to HCs. The SN, which encompasses the bilateral anterior insular cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, is responsible for evaluating surrounding information and internal events to switch the relevant processing system (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Uddin, 2015</xref>). In our study, altered intranetwork FC was located in a part of the SN, i.e., bilateral insular cortex, which has been proved to be an important structure in language production (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Uddin et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, fMRI studies proved that language and reading skills were closely correlated with both intra- and internetwork synchronization of the anterior insular cortex (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Supekar and Menon, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Zaccarella and Friederici, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). The increased intranetwork of the bilateral anterior insular cortex, especially the left anterior insular cortex near the stroke lesion that still showed an increased activation, indicated a compensatory reorganization for aphasia at the subacute stage.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S5.SS2">
        <title>Altered Functional Connectivity Between Resting-State Network</title>
        <p>We found that pDMN and rFPN showed a decreased coupling with lFPN; in contrast, SN presented an increased FC with lFPN. As an asymmetrical network, the FPN was divided into lFPN and rFPN. The lFPN included the classical language-related brain areas, such as Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Harding et al., 2015</xref>). The lFPN identified in our study covered the left middle frontal lobe, left supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, and left precuneus, which broadly include language ability-related regions. The brain structure of rFPN was mainly composed of the right angular gyrus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right frontal oculomotor area, and right precuneus (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Balaev et al., 2016</xref>). Language dysfunction has been proved to be closely related to intrinsic lFPN connectivity through a static rs-fMRI study (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Vlooswijk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). We found patients with PSA showing a significant decrease in FC between lFPN and rFPN. This may be due to the distribution of lFPN regions that were mainly located in the blood supply area of the left middle cerebral artery, where the stroke lesions occurred in this study. Furthermore, it was not an accidental finding that pDMN and rFPN showed abnormal coupling with lFPN. Compared with previous reports, we have newly found the coupling interruption between the bilateral FPN in patients with PSA at the subacute stage. In addition, we found that the auditory-verbal comprehension disability on WAB tests was positively correlated with decreased FC between the lFPN and right cerebral hemisphere, which is consistent with previous literature reports (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Balaev et al., 2016</xref>). These findings indicated that focal stroke lesions of the left hemisphere influenced the language comprehension ability by disrupting the brain network coupling in PSA at the subacute stage.</p>
        <p>The concept of DMN, defined as a baseline state of the normal adult human brain, was identified by <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Raichle et al. (2001)</xref> through PET and fMRI. DMN was further described as two parts, namely, (i) the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate were classified as the anterior DMN (aDMN) and (ii) posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, and bilateral angular gyrus were classified as the pDMN (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Wang C. et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). As an important cortical center with high metabolic activity, pDMN had connections to a wide range of brain regions (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Greicius et al., 2003</xref>), and it was also shown to be primarily responsible for connections to the FPN (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Leech et al., 2012</xref>). Many studies found that pDMN was tightly connected to the key region in language processing within FPN (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Crone et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lambon Ralph, 2010</xref>). Our study showed reduced coupling between lFPN and pDMN in patients with PSA, which further validated the previous view.</p>
        <p>The DMN has been proven to be closely correlated with cognitive function in healthy individuals (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Mak et al., 2017</xref>), as well as some neurological diseases, such as epilepsy (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), Alzheimer’s disease (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Dennis and Thompson, 2014</xref>), and Parkinson’s disease (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Rektorova, 2014</xref>). DMN, FPN, and SN constitute the “triple network model” of aberrant saliency mapping and cognitive dysfunction in psychopathology (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Menon, 2011</xref>). The “triple network model” has been reported to be involved in autism, cognition impairment, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Menon, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gürsel et al., 2020</xref>). SN has a pivotal role in switching between DMN and FPN, which represents shifting between self-referential thoughts (modulated by the DMN) and goal-directed behavior (modulated by the FPN) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dodds et al., 2011</xref>). Few studies report the impairment of the “triple network model” in patients with PSA. Abnormal FC of pDMN/lFPN and SN/lFPN indicated a disrupted regulation in the “triple network model” in this study. However, no significant correlation was found between the strength of the “triple network model” coupling and WAB score. Our findings demonstrated that the destruction of the “triple network model” was revealed in the subacute phase of PSA either, but further study is needed to verify the correlation with language ability.</p>
        <p>The current results showed differences from previous studies. These discrepancies may be related to that the time point of the recruitment of a patient was different. Patients in other studies were selected 1 day or 1–10 months after stroke, whereas our patients had a shorter time span (typically at 1 month after stroke), which means our patients have temporal homogeneity.</p>

      <sec id="S5.SS3">
        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p>There were some limitations that should be noted in our study. First, all patients were on conventional medication. Although patients underwent fMRI scanning while they were off medication for at least 24 h, and the effects of treatment could not be completely ruled out. Second, the current sample size was relatively small, and a larger sample size might be better for further analysis. Third, only patients at the subacute stage were analyzed because the neurobiological state of the brain was relatively stable in this phase, such as less reperfusion of brain tissue or cell regeneration than at the acute stage (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Stefaniak et al., 2020</xref>). Fourth, it cannot be ruled out that intranetwork FC of the left anterior insular cortex of SN (2 cases of 20) may be affected by cerebrovascular changes due to which was adjacent to the lesion. It would be better if the future study can verify whether there is an influence between cerebrovascular changes and cortical network dysfunction. Finally, the head motion effect may not be fully ruled out although we implemented a series of procedures to reduce the impact of head movement.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>We found the abnormalities of FC within and between multiple brain networks in patients with PSA at the subacute stage. Reduced lFPN-rFPN connectivity was closely associated with Yes/No questions, indicating that brain focal lesions influence language comprehension ability by disrupting the brain network. Revealing the patterns of the brain network FC may improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms and may also contribute to clinical therapy.</p>
