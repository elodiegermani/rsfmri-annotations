      <abstract>
        <p>Multi-site resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data can facilitate learning-based approaches to train reliable models on more data. However, significant data heterogeneity between imaging sites, caused by different scanners or protocols, can negatively impact the generalization ability of learned models. In addition, previous studies have shown that graph convolution neural networks (GCNs) are effective in mining fMRI biomarkers. However, they generally ignore the potentially different contributions of brain regions- of-interest (ROIs) to automated disease diagnosis/prognosis. In this work, we propose a multi-site rs-fMRI adaptation framework with attention GCN (A<sup>2</sup>GCN) for brain disorder identification. Specifically, the proposed A<sup>2</sup>GCN consists of three major components: (1) a node representation learning module based on GCN to extract rs-fMRI features from functional connectivity networks, (2) a node attention mechanism module to capture the contributions of ROIs, and (3) a domain adaptation module to alleviate the differences in data distribution between sites through the constraint of mean absolute error and covariance. The A<sup>2</sup>GCN not only reduces data heterogeneity across sites, but also improves the interpretability of the learning algorithm by exploring important ROIs. Experimental results on the public ABIDE database demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance in fMRI-based recognition of autism spectrum disorders.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an imaging technique that uses blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals to obtain functional graphs of brain activity while subjects are at rest [<xref rid="B1-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Compared with other fMRI techniques, rs-fMRI has advantages because it is non-invasive and has high tissue resolution, and it can skillfully detect the difference between the functional activity network of the human brain under pathological conditions and that of the normal human brain [<xref rid="B2-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. At the same time, benefiting from the progress of scanning hardware and scanning technology, as well as the rapid development of computer vision technology, rs-fMRI has gradually become one of the effective means to study the human brain in recent years. Relying on rs-fMRI technology, researchers have made remarkable achievements in the auxiliary diagnosis, pathogenesis research, objective biomarker search and other aspects of mental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Major Depressive Disorder [<xref rid="B3-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Currently, the application of machine learning/deep learning in natural image analysis is very successful. In contrast, its use in the analysis of neuroimaging data presents some unique problems, including dimensional disaster, small sample size, and limited true labels [<xref rid="B5-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. With the continued efforts of researchers, public multi-site neuroimage datasets, increasing the sample size and statistical power of data, are helping to promote the adoption of data-driven machine learning/deep learning techniques. However, the study of multi-site datasets will face another important challenge. That is, the distribution of data between sites is often quite different due to external factors such as different scanners or protocols [<xref rid="B7-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This will severely limit the generalization ability of machine/deep learning models, as such algorithms often start with the assumption that all data remain the same distribution [<xref rid="B9-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Studies have shown that detection of abnormal low-frequency fluctuations in the BOLD signals caused by pathological changes in the resting state will facilitate the analysis of brain connectivity and provide scientific and reliable treatment options before and after surgery [<xref rid="B12-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Typically in studies of neuroimaging data, brain functional connectivity networks (FCNs) attempt to establish a potential causal link between two regions-of-interest (ROIs) based on linear temporal correlations [<xref rid="B13-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Previous studies usually use statistical measures of FCNs (including betweenness centrality, degree centrality, and other features) to construct prediction models [<xref rid="B14-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These practices often rely on extensive expert knowledge and are subjective, expensive, and time-consuming. FCN is usually defined as a complex non-Euclidean space graph structure [<xref rid="B16-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In recent years, graph neural networks, especially graph convolutional networks (GCNs), have become one of the effective tools to deal with irregular graph data. GCN is a natural extension of the convolutional neural network in a graph domain [<xref rid="B17-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It can be used as a feature extractor to learn node feature information and structure information end-to-end at the same time, which is the best choice for graph data learning task at present [<xref rid="B19-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. When GCN is naturally used to analyze rs-fMRI data, comprehensive mapping of brain FC patterns can effectively describe the functional activity of the brain [<xref rid="B21-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, existing studies usually ignore the potential contribution of different brain functional regions to the diagnosis of brain diseases, thus affecting the interpretability of the GCN model.</p>
      <p>As shown in <xref rid="brainsci-12-01413-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, we construct a domain adaptation model with attention GCN (A<sup>2</sup>GCN) of multi-site rs-fMRI for ASD diagnosis. For the convenience of description, we set a known site as the source domain, and define the site to be predicted as the target domain. In this paper, we focus on the classification task of graphs. Therefore, we first construct the corresponding FCNs based on the rs-fMRI data of subjects from the source/target domains, and take the FCNs as the corresponding source/target graphs. Then, we use GCN as a feature extractor to capture the nodes/ROIs representations from the source/target graphs respectively through the graph convolution layers. In addition, the node attention mechanism is applied to explore the contribution weight of nodes/ROIs automatically. Finally, the objective function composed of multiple loss functions is jointly optimized, so as to establish a cross-domain classification model with a wider application range. We will use rs-fMRI data from the three sites (NYU, UM, UCLA) of the public ABIDE database [<xref rid="B23-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to identify ASD patients from healthy controls (HCs) to evaluate the performance of our approach.</p>
      <p>The rest of this work is shown below: In <xref rid="sec2-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="sec">Section 2</xref>, we briefly review the related research results of this work. In <xref rid="sec3-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref>, we present our method and experimental setup.

At the same time, ablation experiments are added to investigate the contribution of key components in our proposed model.

        <title>2.1. Graph Convolution Network for fMRI Analysis</title>
        <p>At present, the application of deep learning framework, especially the graph convolutional networks (GCNs) model, to graph-structured data has aroused a warm response worldwide [<xref rid="B24-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. GCN is used to advance the feature learning of the network, which integrates the central node characteristics and graph topology information in the convolutional layer [<xref rid="B26-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In particular, GCN has achieved impressive results in helping researchers build mathematical models for computer-assisted diagnosis of brain diseases and process and analyze neuroimaging data quickly and efficiently [<xref rid="B27-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, Wang et al. [<xref rid="B28-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] defined a GCN architecture based on features of fMRI for brain disorder analysis. Based on the spatiotemporal information of rs-fMRI time series, Yao et al. [<xref rid="B29-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] constructed time-adaptive GCN architecture to study the periodic characteristics of the human brain. Gadgil et al. [<xref rid="B30-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] focused on the short subsequence of BOLD signal, so as to construct a spatio-temporal GCN architecture and explore the non-stationary properties of FC. Traditional GCN research usually regards feature representations of each node as independently and equally. That is, they did not consider the unique contribution of each specific node/ROI to rs-fMRI analysis. In this paper, we will establish a ROI/node feature attention mechanism based on GCN to learn potential functional dependencies among brain regions, which allows us to identify those most informative brain regions for diagnosis. This will significantly improve the interpretability of GCN models for automated fMRI analysis.</p>

        <title>2.2. Domain Adaptation for Brain Disorder Diagnosis</title>
        <p>Data acquired from multiple imaging sites are correlated but distributed differently, which is a classic domain adaptation problem [<xref rid="B31-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. According to the latest research, domain adaptation related algorithms can be roughly summarized into two categories: (1) supervised domain adaptation. The target domain samples contain a large or small amount of label information; (2) unsupervised domain adaptation. There is no data label available for the target domain [<xref rid="B33-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This work will focus on the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation, that is, samples from the source domain contain complete data labels, while samples from the target domain to be analyzed have no label information, which is more valuable and challenging for applications. In recent years, in order to achieve domain alignment, many cross-domain classification algorithms have been proposed, including adaptive methods based on discrepancy, adversarial learning and data reconstruction [<xref rid="B34-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In recent years, domain adaptation technology has also achieved remarkable results in the field of medical imaging. Ingalhalikar et al. [<xref rid="B35-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] coordinated multi-site neuroimaging data based on empirical Bayes formula to improve the accuracy of brain diagnostic classification. Guan et al. [<xref rid="B32-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] defined a multi-site domain attention model based on deep learning for brain disease recognition. Zhang et al. [<xref rid="B36-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] constructed an unsupervised domain adversarial network and established a brain disease prediction model with good classification performance. In this paper, we adopt the classical domain adaptation algorithm, that is, calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) and covariance of the source domain and the target domain at the same time, so as to guide the gradual alignment of node features learned from different domains and alleviate the domain offset problem.</p>

Specifically, the NYU site included 164 subjects, including 71 with ASD and 93 with HC. The UM site included 113 subjects, 48 with ASD, and 65 with HC. The UCLA site included 74 subjects, 36 with ASD, and 38 with HC. We built the graph based on these three sites.

Then, we use the classical AAL atlas to divide each subject’s brain into 116 functional regions and extract their average time series.

The dataset before the arrow is defined as the source domain, and the dataset after the arrow is set as the target domain. The source domain samples all contained complete category labels, while the target domain subjects had no label information. Considering the limited number of samples, we will use all source/target domain samples for training and testing all target domain subjects. In order to make the result more reasonable, we repeat the training process 10 times, and take the mean value and standard deviation of each algorithm as the final result.</p>

In order to prevent dimensional disaster, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm limits the dimension of variables to 64 dimensions.

At the same time, add CORAL loss minimization domain offset. The covariance between the sample features of the source domain and the target domain is defined as CORAL loss.

Because these traditional methods only consider the characteristics of nodes, however, those methods that use GCN as feature extractors can update and aggregate the features of nodes on the graph end-to-end with the help of the underlying topology information of FCNs, in order to learn more discriminative node representation, which may be more beneficial for ASD auxiliary diagnosis.</p>

        <p>In <xref rid="brainsci-12-01413-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, we report the corresponding ACC and AUC values. As shown in <xref rid="brainsci-12-01413-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, we can find that the performance of three variants A<sup>2</sup>GCN_A (without domain adaptation module), A<sup>2</sup>GCN_M (with attention mechanism module and part of domain adaptation module), and A<sup>2</sup>GCN_C (without domain attention mechanism module) are significantly degraded in the corresponding transfer learning task. In particular, A<sup>2</sup>GCN_A achieved the worst performance in most cases. The underlying reason could be that attention mechanisms play a role in extracting more discriminative features. In addition, it also shows that using MAE loss and CORAL loss to align the learned features step by step during training can reduce the data information loss caused by readout-related pooling operations, thus significantly improving the robustness and transmission performance of A<sup>2</sup>GCN.

        <p>To visually demonstrate the features learned through the proposed A<sup>2</sup>GCN, we use the t-SNE [<xref rid="B45-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] tool to visualize the data distribution of different imaging sites before and after domain adaptation. In <xref rid="brainsci-12-01413-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, the blue and red dots represent the source and target domains, respectively. To visualize the regional heterogeneity before domain adaptation, we flattened the upper triangle of the FCN matrix for each sample of each site. The vector representation is obtained, which is further reduced to 64 dimensions by the PCA method as the original representation of the sample. From <xref rid="brainsci-12-01413-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a, we can observe that there is a significant domain shift between the distribution of the source domain and the target domain. We use the t-SNE algorithm to visualize feature distribution of the source and target domains after the feature extractor GCN in different cross-site classification tasks (through A<sup>2</sup>GCN), with results reported in <xref rid="brainsci-12-01413-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b. In <xref rid="brainsci-12-01413-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b, red and blue dots are closely clustered together. This means that the distributions of the node representations of the two domains learned by our method are close, and the domain heterogeneity has been substantially reduced. At the same time, we calculated the Frobenius norm of the covariance (CF) between samples in the source domain and the target domain, which is used to measure the difference of data distribution between different sites. It is observed that the CF between different sites is significantly reduced after domain adaptation. These results show that A<sup>2</sup>GCN can effectively extract transferable features and reduce domain shift.</p>

        <p>One of the main focuses of this work is to use interpretable deep learning algorithms to discover the underlying differences between ASD and HC subjects. An interesting question is to identify the most informative brain regions for ASD detection. In the task of “NYU→UM”, we randomly select 10 subjects from the UM site. We then extract the features of these subjects after the attention mechanism module, select 19 brain regions with strong correlation, and visualize them using BrainNet [<xref rid="B46-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] tool, with results shown in <xref rid="brainsci-12-01413-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. In <xref rid="brainsci-12-01413-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, the color of brain regions is randomly assigned, and the stick-like connections between brain regions indicate strong FC between them. For ASD vs. HC classification, we find that the most informative brain regions include the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, putamen lentiform, and the vicinity of thalamus, which is also consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="B47-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-brainsci-12-01413" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>In this paper, we construct a multi-site unsupervised rs-fMRI domain adaptation framework (A<sup>2</sup>GCN) with an attention mechanism for ASD diagnosis. The framework automatically extracts rs-fMRI features from brain FCNs with the help of the GCN model. The attention mechanism is used to explore the contribution of different brain regions to the automatic detection of brain diseases and explore the interpretable features of brain regions. In addition, our method explores mean absolute error and covariance-based constraints to alleviate data distribution differences among imaging sites. We evaluate our proposed method using rs-fMRI data from a real multi-site dataset (ABIDE). Experimental results show that the A<sup>2</sup>GCN has significant advantages over several advanced methods.</p>

        <p>Architecture of the proposed multi-site resting-state fMRI adaptation framework (A<sup>2</sup>GCN) with an attention-guided GCN for brain disorder identification. The A<sup>2</sup>GCN consists of three components: (1) With the help of GCN model, rs-fMRI features are automatically extracted from the brain graph from the source or target domains; (2) Explore the potential contribution of different brain regions to automatic detection of brain diseases by using attention mechanism; (3) Under the constraints of mean absolute error and covariance, the objective function (composed of MAE loss, CORAL loss and cross entropy loss) is established for knowledge transfer between different domains.</p>
