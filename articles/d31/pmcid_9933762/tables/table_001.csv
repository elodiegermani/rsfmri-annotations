Measurement,Definition,Equation
Node degree,The no of connections between one node and the rest of the network,ki=Σ(aij)
Clustering coefficient,The no of connections between the neighbours of a node,2t/(k(k−1));k is the node degree; t is the fraction of triangles around a node.
Efficiency,Inverse of path length (minimum no of edges to traverse from one node to another),1N(N−1)Σ(1dij)Where dij is the shortest path length between nodes i and j
Modularity,"Areas of highly interconnected nodes, with few connections to nodes in other modules","Q=1lΣ(aij−(kikj)l)δ(mi,mj)"
