        <p>Brain parcellation helps to understand the structural and functional organization of the cerebral cortex. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and connectivity analysis provide useful information to delineate individual brain parcels <italic>in vivo</italic>. We proposed an individualized cortical parcellation based on graph neural networks (GNN) to learn the reliable functional characteristics of each brain parcel on a large fMRI dataset and to infer the areal probability of each vertex on unseen subjects. A subject-specific confidence mask was implemented in the GNN model to account for the tradeoff between the topographic alignment across subjects and functional homogeneity of brain parcels on individual brains. The individualized brain parcellation achieved better functional homogeneity at rest and during cognitive tasks compared with the group-registered atlas (<italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.05). In addition, highly reliable and replicable parcellation maps were generated on multiple sessions of the same subject (intrasubject similarity = 0.89), while notable variations in the topographic organization were captured across subjects (intersubject similarity = 0.81). Moreover, the intersubject variability of brain parcellation indicated large variations in the association cortices while keeping a stable parcellation on the primary cortex. Such topographic variability was strongly associated with the functional connectivity variability, significantly predicted cognitive behaviors, and generally followed the myelination, cytoarchitecture, and functional organization of the human brain. This study provides new avenues to the precise individualized mapping of the cortical areas through deep learning and shows high potentials in the personalized localization diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Brain atlas has been an important tool to understand the neural basis of human cognition and to study the functional organization of the human brain (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ungerleider and Desimone, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Amunts and Zilles, 2015</xref>). Neuroanatomists have built a variety of brain atlases to depict cyto-, myelo-, and receptor architectures using postmortem brains (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brodmann, 1909</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Zilles and Amunts, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Amunts et al., 2020</xref>). Recent advances in noninvasive neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), provide an opportunity to explore the functional organization of the living human brain. There has been a rich and fast-growing literature on the functional brain parcellation using either spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations of fMRI activity or the aggregation of activation maps across different cognitive tasks (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Blumensath et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Eickhoff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Eickhoff et al., 2018a</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). The majority of current approaches focused on the group representative functional mapping of the cerebral cortex, which may provide useful insights into the intrinsic organizational principles of the human brain (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Buckner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Wig, 2017</xref>), but ignore the variability of individual brains in areal size, location, spatial arrangement, and connectivity patterns (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Zuo and Xing, 2014</xref>). The precise mapping of individualized functional areas is a critical step toward better understanding of the structural–functional relationship of the human brain that underlying cognition and behavior (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) as well as for personalized localization diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
      <p>Traditional individualized mapping of brain atlas has relied on the linear and nonlinear registration based on the structural images in the volume space or cortical surfaces. Modern machine learning algorithms provide analytic tools to align cortical areas using neuroimaging data across multiple modalities, including myelin maps and functional localizers (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2018</xref>), as well as anatomical (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2021</xref>) and functional connectivity fingerprints (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). As one of the most commonly used features for individualized brain mapping, functional connectivity has been shown to reveal individual-specific topographic organization that better predicted cognitive functions and behaviors (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). However, the reliability and validity of such topographic variability has been one major concern considering that the fMRI signals are highly contaminated by noises of various physiological processes and head motions. By explicitly separating actual intersubject variability from noise components (evaluated by multiple sessions of the same subject), studies have shown that the individualized parcellation not only exhibited better functional homogeneity at rest and during cognitive tasks (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2021</xref>), but also captured reliable and inheritable variability in the topographic organization of the human brain (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>), demonstrated by the genetic effects of topographic variability. Yet, this multisession hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) used a global concentration parameter to model the heterogeneity of functional connectivity for different brain parcels, and resulted in similar levels of topographic variability and heritability among the primary and association cortices by treating each area equally, which is in congruence with the well-known sensory-fugal gradient in the myelination, cytoarchitecture, and functional organization of human brain.</p>
      <p>In this study, we proposed a masked graph neural network (GNN) architecture to learn the reliable functional characteristics of each brain parcel using fMRI data from a large population and to apply such information to infer the areal probability of each vertex on unseen subjects. Specifically, we constructed a vertex-level brain graph for each subject and embed the whole-brain functional connectivity profiles as signals on the graph. Then we used high-order graph convolution to integrate the local connectivity context of each vertex such that the fluctuations in functional connectivity profiles were evaluated among a small neighboring area in the cortical surface rather than on each vertex individually, largely suppressing the noise effects from individual fMRI runs. Besides, we trained hundreds of graph convolutional kernels at each graph convolution layer to encode the variational organizational principles among cortical areas. Moreover, we implemented subject-specific confidence masks in the GNN model to maintain a consistent global topographic organization among subjects while preserving the intersubject variability in brain parcellation especially for vertices around the areal borders. Compared with the baseline approaches including the group-registered atlas and MS-HBM, our model generated highly consistent and replicable parcellation maps on individual brains, along with better functional homogeneity at rest and during cognitive tasks. Moreover, the topographic variability generally followed a sensory-fugal gradient from primary and unimodal areas to heteromodal areas, with high variations in the association cortices while keeping a stable parcellation on the primary cortex. More importantly, the topographic variability was strongly associated with individual variability in functional connectivity profiles and cognitive behaviors.</p>

        <title>Data Acquisition and Preprocessing</title>
        <p>We used two independent datasets acquired from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset, consisting of T1-weighted (T1w) data, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), as well as task-fMRI data for each subject. The individualized parcellation model was first trained and evaluated on a large dataset consisting of 1,022 subjects acquired from the Human Connectome Project S1200 release<sup><xref rid="footnote1" ref-type="fn">1</xref></sup>. We then evaluated the test–retest reliability of the model on the second dataset, consisting of 44 subjects acquired from the HCP test–retest datasets. Whole-brain echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisitions were acquired with a 32-channel head coil on a modified 3T Siemens Skyra with TR = 720 ms, 2.0-mm isotropic voxels, using a multiband sequence. Each subject underwent two fMRI sessions on separate days, including two runs of 14-min resting-state and seven task fMRI scans (we only used fMRI data with the left to right (LR) phase encoding in the current study). The task-fMRI database includes seven cognitive domains, which are emotion, gambling, language, motor, relational, social, and working memory. The detailed description of data collection and task paradigms can be found in <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barch et al. (2013)</xref>.</p>
        <p>We used the minimal preprocessed fMRI data from the HCP pipelines<sup><xref rid="footnote2" ref-type="fn">2</xref></sup> : (1) fMRIVolume pipeline generates “minimally preprocessed” 4D time series (i.e., “.nii.gz” file) that includes gradient unwarping, motion correction, fieldmap-based EPI distortion correction, brain-boundary-based registration of EPI to structural T1-weighted scan, nonlinear (FNIRT) registration into MNI152 space, and grand-mean intensity normalization. (2) fMRISurface pipeline projects fMRI data from the cortical gray matter ribbon onto the individual brain surface (fs_LR32K surface space) and then onto template surface meshes (i.e., “dtseries.nii” file), followed by surface-based smoothing using a geodesic Gaussian algorithm. Additional preprocessing steps were applied on rs-fMRI data before the calculation of functional connectivity, including regressing out the signals from white matter and csf, and the bandpass temporal filtering on frequencies between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz. Further details on fMRI data acquisition and preprocessing can be found in <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Glasser et al. (2013)</xref> and <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barch et al.

        <title>Construction of Individual Brain Graph</title>
        <p>The preprocessed fMRI data were mapped onto the standard surface template with 32k vertices per hemisphere. After removing confounding vertices on the medial surfaces, the cortical mask consists of 59,412 cortical vertices. Then an adjacency matrix A was generated from the surface mesh files, with A<sub>ij</sub> = 1 indicating that the two vertices i and j are shared in a common triangle in the cortical mesh. Since all subjects have already been registered onto the standard surface template during data preprocessing, the adjacency matrix A was also shared across all subjects. As such, a binary brain graph 𝒢 = (𝒱,ℰ) was constructed for each individual brain, with the node 𝒱 indicating each vertex in the cortical mesh, and the edge ℰ specified by the adjacency matrix indicating whether two nodes are connected or not. The resulting brain graph is sparsely connected and highly localized in space, with each vertex only connecting with two to six nearest vertices on average.</p>

        <title>Functional Connectivity Profile as Graph Signals</title>
        <p>For each vertex in the cortical mask, we calculated its functional connectivity profile by calculating Pearson correlations on preprocessed fMRI signals and treated it as a feature vector on each node of the graph. In order to save the computational cost and complexity, we did not use the vertex-wise functional connectivity maps but instead calculated the connectivity fingerprints evaluated on hundreds of functional region of interest (ROIs) from a group atlas, e.g., Schaefer400 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>). The connectivity fingerprint of each cortical vertex <italic>x</italic> represents the probability of assigning the seed vertex to the same label of each functional ROI. These connectivity profiles were then concatenated and embedded in the individual brain graph as graph <italic>X</italic> ∈ ℝ<sup><italic>N</italic> = <italic>F</italic></sup>, where <italic>N</italic> indicates the number of cortical vertices, and <italic>F</italic> indicates the number of features in the connectivity profiles.</p>

The resulting confidence map contains around half of the cortical mask (56% of vertices) that contributed to the final loss function in all subjects. The benefits of using the above loss function include: (1) high contributions from the vertices near the center of brain parcels, preserving a consistent global topographic organization across subjects; and (2) small contributions from the vertices around the areal borders, retaining the intersubject variability to some degree by introducing mismatching labels across subjects.</p>

        <title>Comparison With Alternative Machine Learning Approaches</title>
        <p>Many approaches of individualized brain parcellation have been proposed in the literature, for instance, by using an iterative clustering of fMRI signals (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) or hierarchical inference through a multilevel Bayesian model (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2021</xref>). We included two individualized methods as baseline approaches in the current study. The first approach aligned the group atlas into individual brains using the multimodal alignment protocol (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2018</xref>), which utilized myelin maps, resting state network maps, and visuotopic maps to align cortical areas. The second approach modified the individual mapping of brain atlas using a multisession hierarchical Bayesian model (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), by explicitly modeling the variability in functional connectivity at the levels of intra- and intersubject. The preprocessed HCP fMRI dataset has already included the copies of the first approach (i.e., the MSMALL version), for which we compared the functional homogeneity between our individualized brain parcellation and group-registered brain atlas (see section “Resting State Functional Homogeneity of Brain Parcels”). For fair comparisons with the second approach, we reran the MS-HBM approach on the same group of subjects along with the same preprocessing steps as in our model and compared the distribution of topographic variability between the two approaches (see section “The Intersubject Reliability and Variability of Individual Properties”). We chose the Schaefer400 atlas (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>) as the referenced group atlas for all approaches and used the author-suggested model parameters for rerunning the MS-HBM approach (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2021</xref>), including priors of group spatial (100), markov random field (MRF) smoothing (50), and gradient-based spatial localization (50).</p>

The variability of connectivity profiles (i.e., functional connectivity variability) was measured by the correlation coefficients of the functional connectivity profiles between two fMRI runs.</p>
        <p>For further validation of the biological basis of the intersubject variability in brain parcellation, additional association analyses were conducted for the areal topographic variability, including the variability of connectivity profiles, distribution of T1w/T2w myelin ratio, as well as the sensory-fugal map of laminar differentiation. As a quantitative measure of the myelin content of cerebral cortex, the myelin ratio map was defined as the ratio of T1w and T2w structural images on each subject and then averaged across all subjects on the HCP S1200 release (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Glasser and Van Essen, 2011</xref>). The cortical myelin map was then mapped onto the chosen group atlas by averaging the T1w/T2w ratio within each ROI.

For each task contrast, we evaluated the regional variability and homogeneity in the task activations from the test subjects of the HCP S1200 dataset. Regional variability in task activation was evaluated by calculating the standard deviation of brain activation within each parcel by using the beta maps derived from the generalized linear model (GLM) analysis. Lower task variability indicates small variations of task activations within each brain parcel and large variations along the areal boundaries. Regional homogeneity in task activation was evaluated by the mean activation strength in each brain parcel. Higher task homogeneity indicates better functional alignment in the task activations across different subjects.</p>

During model training, a vertex-level brain graph was first constructed from individual T1-weighted brain images, indicating the spatial adjacency between any two vertices in the cortical surface. The functional connectivity profiles of each vertex were then embedded in the brain graph as graph signals. Finally, the areal probability of each vertex was inferred by using a two-layer graph convolution architecture with a subject-specific confidence mask.

First, a stable brain parcellation scheme was revealed such that the majority of vertices showed consistent parcel labels across subjects, with over 75% of cortical vertices showing a high population probability &gt;0.6. We observed near-perfect alignment at the center of brain parcels along with notable variability around the areal borders (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Second, the reliability of individual parcellation, measured by the intra- and intersubject similarity (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), showed significantly higher consistency among multiple sessions of the same subject (dice = 0.889 ± 0.025) than between different subjects (dice = 0.810 ± 0.021), as revealed by a paired <italic>t</italic>-test (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the intersubject variability in brain parcellation (i.e., areal topographic variability), evaluated by the Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> effect size among individualized parcellation maps, was not uniformly distributed in the cerebral cortex, but rather followed the functional organizational principles (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). After mapping the areal topographic variability onto the seven functional networks (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Ito, 2018</xref>), we found consistent parcellation schemes for the motor and sensory cortices (i.e., low variability) and divergent brain parcels for the association cortices (i.e., high variability) including frontal, parietal, and temporal areas (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Compared with another individualized parcellation approach, e.g., the MS-HBM, our MSGCN model revealed higher areal topographic variably, in general (<xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), with a similar level of areal topographic variability in the primary cortex but detecting much higher variability in the secondary and association cortices (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Interpretability of Intersubject Variability in Brain Parcellation</title>
        <p>The intersubject variability of MSGCN parcellation was biologically meaningful and followed the myelination and cytoarchitectonic organizational principles of the human brain.

For instance, much higher variability was detected in the idiotypic and unimodal regions rather than in the heteromodal regions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, the areal topographic variability of the MSGCN parcellation was significantly associated with the T1w/T2w myelin ratios as well (<italic>r</italic> = −0.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), indicating low variability in the primary motor and visual cortex, which are heavily myelinated, and high variability in the association cortices, which are more lightly myelinated (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Glasser and Van Essen, 2011</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we propose an individualized cortical parcellation method that projects the group atlas onto individual brains by taking into account the variations in brain topography and functional connectivity. The proposed MSGCN parcellation generated highly consistent parcellation maps on multiple sessions of the same subject (intrasubject similarity = 0.89) while capturing reasonable topographic variations between subjects (intersubject similarity = 0.81). Compared with other baseline approaches including the group-registered atlas and MS-HBM, our method generated more homogeneous parcels on individual brains that strongly aligned with the intrinsic brain organization at rest and task-evoked brain activation of cognitive tasks. Moreover, the MSGCN parcellation revealed higher intersubject variability in the association cortices while keeping a stable parcellation on the primary cortex, indicating a sensory-fugal gradient from primary and unimodal areas to heteromodal areas. Such topographic variability in individualized parcellation strongly associated with the variability of functional connectivity profiles and cognitive behaviors, and generally followed the myelination, cytoarchitecture, and functional organization of the human brain.</p>
      <p>Individualized brain parcellation has played a more and more important part in neuroscience research and clinical studies, which not only better predicted human cognition, behaviors, personality, and emotion (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2021</xref>), but also captured reliable and inheritable variability in the topographic organization of the human brain (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>), as well as more precise diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, due to the inevitable contamination of fMRI signals by physiological noises and head motions, the traditional individualized parcellation approaches usually suffer from low generalizability on new datasets and low consistency among repeated scans. To address this issue, we applied a high-order graph convolution along with a multilayer deep learning architecture in this study. As a generalization of the conventional convolutional operations onto nongrid structures, graph convolution applies a series of low-frequency filters on the graph modes, also known as using multiple smoothing kernels on the cortical surface, and detects low fluctuations of functional connectivity along the vertex-level brain graph. The smoothing effect was controlled by the order of ChebNet graph convolution. Using this graph convolution architecture, the model generated very stable parcellations on a large population with over 75% of cortical vertices following the global topographic organization by assigning them to the same parcels among different subjects. Besides, highly consistent parcellation maps (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) were generated on the multiple sessions of the same subject (dice = 0.89), along with lower consistency between subjects (dice = 0.81). Yet, high-order kernels and deep architectures may introduce over-smoothing issues in GNN, which tends to generate identical parcellation maps on all subjects. We have also observed such over-smoothing effect in our MSGCN model such that the functional homogeneity of individualized brain parcels gradually reduced when using higher-order graph convolutions (<italic>K</italic> &gt; 3 in <xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Considering the tradeoff between the intersubject variability and intrasubject reliability in individualized brain parcellation, we used the third-order graph convolution along with two layers in our model, which not only revealed high consistency among test–retest sessions but also captured notable variability of brain parcellation between subjects.</p>
      <p>The separation of intersubject variability from the randomly appearing noise components have also been considered in previous individualized parcellation models, for instance, using a hierarchical Bayesian model to quantify the variability of functional connectivity at multiple levels (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2021</xref>). However, by treating each area equally through a global concentration parameter on all regions, the MS-HBM approach revealed similar levels of topographic variability and heritability among the primary and association cortices (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>), which is in congruence with the well-known sensory-fugal gradient in brain organization. To avoid this effect, we chose a data-driven approach to learn the functional characteristics of each brain parcel inferred from a large group of subjects and to encode the intra- and inter-region heterogeneity of functional connectivity through a large set of graph convolutional kernels. The detected region-specific connectivity fingerprints have been proven to be highly generalizable and reliable when inferring the areal probability on unseen subjects (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The main reasons that drive this effect include (1) integrating the local connectivity context of each vertex instead of treating each vertex independently, (2) detecting the fluctuations in functional connectivity profiles within a small neighboring area in the cortical surface, and (3) indicating the areal borders on individual brains by using the gradients of function connectivity fluctuations at multiple levels. As a result, the model revealed large intersubject variability in brain parcellation, and such topographic variability was not randomly or uniformly distributed across the cerebral cortex, but rather followed the global distribution of myelination, cytoarchitecture, and functional organization of the human brain (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The model demonstrated low variability in the primary and unimodal cortices that are heavily myelinated and large variations in the heteromodal and association cortices that are lightly myelinated. Similar associations with the myelination and cytoarchitecture organization have also been reported in both brain anatomy and function (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Huntenburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Demirta et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting a sensory-fugal gradient in the individual developmental and evolutionary expansion of the cerebral cortex (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Glasser and Van Essen, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>There are two main goals for the individualized brain parcellation, including (1) functional homogeneity of brain parcels on individual brains, and (2) consistent topographic organization across multiple sessions and different subjects. The tradeoff between these two goals was addressed by using a semi-supervised learning framework with subject-specific confidence masks. Specifically, during model training, a subject-specific confidence mask was used for the guidance of topographic alignment across subjects, indicating the true labels for a small portion of cortical vertices, i.e., the labels extracted from the group atlas (see <xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> for an example). These true labels were then used to learn the association between brain topography and functional connectivity profiles and to predict the parcellation of unlabeled data in the training subjects as well as for unseen test subjects. Similar to previous approaches (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), we started from an initial parcellation (see <xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> for an example) that had the highest functional homogeneity by grouping cortical vertices according to their functional connectivity profiles to ensure the functional homogeneity of brain parcels (<xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Additional modifications on this parcellation map, i.e., excluding vertices that were misaligned across sessions of the same subject or with the group atlas, introduced the important features of topographic alignment in individualized parcellation. By implementing the resulting confidence map with the semi-supervised learning, the model captured homogenous parcels on individual subjects that also followed the global topographic organization of the group atlas. It is worth noting that the MSGCN parcellation not only generated the full parcellation of half-labeled training subjects but also made predictions over unseen test subjects where no labeled data were included. The generalizability of the model barely impacts by the size of training set such that labeling all subjects from the dataset, i.e., both training and testing data were drawn from the same sets of subjects, only achieved 2% of improvement on the functional homogeneity but showed much lower intra- and intersubject reliability (<xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>The MSGCN individualized brain parcellation not only generated replicable parcels on individual brains but also captured meaningful individual variability in brain topography and human cognition. The topographic variability generally followed a sensory-fugal gradient from primary and unimodal areas to heteromodal areas, with high variations in the association cortices while keeping a stable parcellation on the primary cortex. Such topographic variability strongly associated with the variability of functional connectivity profiles, and generally followed the myelination, cytoarchitecture, and functional organization of the human brain. More importantly, the topographic variability was highly predictive to individual variability of cognitive behaviors ranging from motor to language to cognition. However, not all behavioral scores showed a strong association with the predicted scores (only 25 out of 58 behaviors with <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). This is probably due to the implementation of the Dice coefficient as the kernel function in the prediction model, which was a global measure of similarity in brain parcellation and had limited power to detect the variability in specific brain regions and networks. Other kernel functions, for instance, resting-state functional connectivity and regional morphological statistics, as well as other prediction models, could be explored in the future.</p>

      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p>In the current study, we used the Schaefer cortical parcellation with 400 regions as the referenced group atlas. Yet, the proposed model is not limited to a specific atlas or specific resolutions per se, but rather easily generalized to other parcellation schemes including functional, anatomical, or multimodal atlases. It is worth noting that, in order to balance between the internal homogeneity in connectivity profiles and consistent topographic organization across subjects, the optimal setting of the graph convolution architecture should be tested when applying to new datasets and atlases, including the order of graph convolution, the number of convolutional layers, as well as the confidence masks.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>We proposed a masked semi-supervised GNN model for individualized brain parcellation taking into account the homogeneity of functional connectivity profiles, alignment of topographic organization across subjects, as well as the reliability of test–retest data on individual brains. Compared with other individualized approaches, the MSGCN parcellation generated more homogenous brain parcels at rest and during cognitive tasks. The model captured high topographic variability that was mainly distributed in the associated cortices while keeping a stable parcellation in the primary and unimodal areas, and generally followed the myelination, cytoarchitecture, and functional organization of the human brain. Moreover, the topographic variability strongly associated with the functional connectivity variability and significantly predicted a series of cognitive behaviors ranging from motor to language to cognition. This study provides new avenues for precise mapping of cortical areas onto individual brains, and shows potential applications in locating personalized functional areas in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.</p>
