MNI coordinates; Significant level at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 pFWE corrected on the cluster level. Nine clusters presented significant group differences (OCD vs. HC) for seed regions of the DMN, and the SN. After additional Bonferroni correction for the number of seed-to-voxel analyses, three clusters based on DMN seeds remained significant: right and left lateral parietal (LP_r/l) to the left occipital pole (OP_l) and LP_r to a cluster comprised the right superior Lateral Occipital Cortex (sLOC_r) and the precuneus.", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_001.csv"}
