      <abstract>
        <p id="P2">The brain can be modelled as a network with nodes and edges derived from a range of imaging modalities: the nodes correspond to spatially distinct regions and the edges to the interactions between them. Whole-brain connectivity studies typically seek to determine how network properties change with a given categorical phenotype such as age-group, disease condition or mental state. To do so reliably, it is necessary to determine the features of the connectivity structure that are common across a group of brain scans. Given the complex interdependencies inherent in network data, this is not a straightforward task. Some studies construct a group-representative network (GRN), ignoring individual differences, while other studies analyse networks for each individual independently, ignoring information that is shared across individuals. We propose a Bayesian framework based on exponential random graph models (ERGM) extended to multiple networks to characterise the distribution of an entire population of networks. Using resting-state fMRI data from the Cam-CAN project, a study on healthy ageing, we demonstrate how our method can be used to characterise and compare the brain’s functional connectivity structure across a group of young individuals and a group of old individuals.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P3">Brain connectivity analysis aims to understand how spatially distinct regions of the brain interact with each other. The use of networks to model whole-brain connectivity has become increasingly popular in recent years (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>): by treating distinct regions as nodes and the connections between them as edges, researchers have gained new insights into both the structure and function of the brain. To determine the salient features of the brain’s connectivity structure, it is necessary to identify which of those are common across individuals. Given the complex interdependencies inherent in network data, however, it is not a trivial task to consider connectivity structure across multiple individuals; how best to combine connectivity information across participants remains a key challenge (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2013b</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P4">Many existing methods aim to construct a (single) group-representative network (GRN) across (multiple) individuals. There have been several methods proposed for constructing GRNs. For example, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Achard et al. (2006)</xref> constructed a group-representative network using mean functional connectivity (mean-GRN) by first taking the mean of the individuals’ functional connectivity matrices and then thresholding the resulting matrix. <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Song et al. (2009)</xref> took a similar approach using the median of the individuals’ functional connectivity matrices (i.e. median-GRN). <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Sinke et al. (2016)</xref> constructed a group-representative structural connectivity network from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data by keeping those edges which are present in at least 35% of the individuals’ networks (i.e. minimal-GRN). These edge-based GRN methods are computationally convenient, since each individual is processed separately and the subsequent analysis is based on a single network. However, these methods ignore higher-order topological properties present in each individual’s network. Rather than construct a completely new network as a combination of each individual’s, other methods represent a whole group by selecting a ‘best’ individual network (i.e. best-GRN) in terms of mutual information (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Meunier et al., 2009</xref>) or Jaccard index (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Joyce et al., 2010</xref>). While this approach preserves the topological properties of a single network, in subsequent analyses it may lead to undue weight being placed on features that are not present in many of the remaining networks.</p>
      <p id="P5">The above issues are compounded when comparing brain networks across groups of individuals, identifying group differences in connectivity via differences in the GRNs from each group. In particular, network metrics are influenced by the overall density of the network (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Ginestet et al., 2011</xref>). As a result, it is difficult to disentangle differences in more complex topological properties such as clustering from differences in the network density; especially in the context of the various GRN methods. This is particularly important in the context of ageing since mean functional connectivity is known to decrease with age (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Geerligs et al., 2017</xref>). Note that it is not trivial to simply control for network density when comparing network metrics due to their highly non-linear relationship.</p>
      <p id="P6">A key consideration is whether to view the network as a single object or a single realisation of a random process. The former implies that the network is a fixed construct, the latter defines a random process (with inherent noise) that gives rise to a distribution of brain networks. An exponential random graph model (ERGM) defines a parametric statistical distribution across all possible networks with a given set of nodes (see <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Robins et al. (2007b)</xref> for a review). The aim of the model is to characterise the distribution of a network in terms of a set of <italic toggle="yes">summary statistics</italic>. These summary statistics are typically comprised of topological features of the network, such as the number of edges and subgraph counts. The summary statistics enter the likelihood via a weighted sum; the weights are (unknown) model parameters that quantify the relative influence of the corresponding summary statistic on the overall network structure and must be inferred from the data. ERGMs are thus a flexible way in which to describe the global network structure as a function of network summary statistics.</p>
      <p id="P7">ERGMs have been applied successfully to characterise both functional connectivity (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Dell’Italia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Obando and Fallani, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and structural connectivity (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Sinke et al., 2016</xref>). To date, there have been two proposed approaches for using ERGMs in group studies. The first approach constructs an edge-based GRN for each group and then fits the same ERGM (i.e. identical summary statistics) separately to each group’s network, obtaining GRN-ERGM parameter estimates (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Sinke et al., 2016</xref>). As described above, this edge-based approach may average over informative topological structure present in each of the individuals’ networks. In contrast, the second approach fits an ERGM to each individuals’ network and then takes the mean or median of the fitted parameters from individuals within a group to represent the group-level connectivity structure (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Obando and Fallani, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2012</xref>; i.e. mean-ERGM or median-ERGM). Note that it is then possible to generate a GRN from the resulting mean-ERGM and median-ERGM parameter estimates (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2012</xref>). While this is preferable to the first approach, taking a simple mean or median may obscure important information.</p>
      <p id="P8">While ERGMs are designed to represent network data in terms of network summary statistics, they are limited in their ability to study specific edges. A complementary approach for analysing brain network data is the mixed effects framework. This models the probability of a connection in terms of both network metrics and covariates (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Simpson and Laurienti, 2015</xref>). Although both approaches incorporate network metrics into the models, the associated parameters have subtly different inter-pretations. The outcome variable in an ERGM is the entire network and the parameters quantify the effect of the network metrics on the global network structure. In contrast, the outcome variables in the mixed effects model are the individual network dyads and the parameters quantify the relationship between the network metrics and the probability of a connection. Note that, by including group membership as a covariate, it is straightforward to use the mixed effects approach for group studies. The aim of this work is to similarly expand the use of ERGMs for group studies.</p>
      <p id="P9">In this article, we introduce a novel framework to model a population of individual brain networks which we call multi-BERGM (the ‘B’ denotes Bayesian; the framework could theoretically be analysed in a frequentist paradigm but we do not consider that further). Our framework uses a Bayesian formulation of the ERGM within a multi-level (i.e hierarchical) model. Bayesian ERGMs have previously been used in the context of a group study to characterise the distribution of a group-representative network (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Sinke et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, our method fits a Bayesian ERGM to each individual network and pools information across multiple individuals nested within multiple groups via the multilevel structure of the overarching model. This provides an approach to characterise connectivity at a group-level, and thus compare the brain’s connectivity structure between groups. We demonstrate our method on functional connectivity networks derived from resting-state fMRI scans of participants from the Cam-CAN project, a study on healthy ageing (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Shafto et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

        <title>Data</title>
        <p id="P10">The data were collected as part of Phase II of the CamCAN project (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.cam-can.org/" ext-link-type="uri">www.cam-can.org</ext-link>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Shafto et al., 2014</xref>). The MRI data were acquired on a 3T Siemens TIM Trio at the MRC Cognition &amp; Brain Sciences Unit, with a 32 channel head-coil. Structural images were acquired using a 1mm<sup>3</sup> isotropic, T1-weighted Magnetization Prepared RApid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) sequence and a 1mm<sup>3</sup> isotropic, T2-weighted Sampling Perfection with Application optimized Contrasts using different flip angle Evolution (SPACE) sequence. The fMRI data for the eyes-closed, resting-state run were acquired using a Gradient-Echo (GE) Echo-Planar Imaging (EPI) sequence, and consisted of 261 volumes (lasting 8 min and 40 s). Each volume contained 32 axial slices (acquired in descending order), with slice thickness of 3.7 mm and interslice gap of 20% (for whole brain coverage including cerebellum; TR 1,970 ms; TE 30ms; voxel-size 3 mm 3 mm 4.44 mm). EPI fieldmaps with two TEs (5.19 ms and 7.65 ms) were also acquired. All the raw data from CamCAN Phase II, together with more acquisition details, are available on: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.cam-can.org/index.php?content=dataset" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.cam-can.org/index.php?content=dataset</ext-link>.</p>
        <p id="P11">The data were processed using r7219 of the SPM12 software (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>), automated with release r5.4 of the Automatic Analysis (AA) pipeline system<sup><xref rid="FN4" ref-type="fn">1</xref></sup> (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Cusack et al., 2015</xref>; see <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al. (2017)</xref> for an overview of the pipelines) in r2015 of MAT-LAB (The MathWorks). To obtain a good starting-point for image normalisation, the T1 image was coregistered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template using rigid body transformation, and then the T2 image was coregistered to the T1. Both T1 and T2 images were bias corrected, and then combined in a multimodal segmentation to estimate images of each of six tissue classes, including grey-matter (GM), white-matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Diffeomorphic registration (DARTEL) was then applied to the GM and WM segments to create group templates, which were in turn transformed to MNI space using a 12-parameter affine transform.</p>
        <p id="P12">The fMRI images were unwarped using distortion fields estimated from the fieldmaps, and corrected for motion using rigid-body realignment to the mean fMRI image across runs. The different slice acquisition times were corrected by interpolating to the middle slice. The images were rigid-body coregistered to the T1 image and the spatial transformations from that T1 to MNI space (diffeomorphic and affine) were applied to every fMRI image. Residual effects of abrupt motion were reduced by applying wavelet despiking (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). The mean time series for all voxels within the thresholded WM and CSF segments were calculated to use as later covariates of no interest.</p>
        <p id="P13">The fMRI time series were then extracted from 90 cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs) from the AAL atlas <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</xref>). ROIs in the cerebellum were not included. The time series for each voxel in each ROI were adjusted for various confounds by taking the residuals from a general linear model (GLM) that included: (<xref rid="FD1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>) the time series in WM and CSF segments, (<xref rid="FD2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>) the 6 rigid-body motion parameters from the realignment stage, (3) the first-order difference in those motion parameters across successive TRs and (<xref rid="FD4" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>) a cosine basis set up to cut-off frequency of 0.008 Hz (implementing a form of high-pass filter). Second-order (squared) terms for (<xref rid="FD1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>), (<xref rid="FD2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>) and (<xref rid="FD3" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>) were also included in the GLM. The autocorrelation in the GLM error was modelled by a family of 8 exponentials with half-lives from 0.5 to 64 TRs (estimated by pooling across voxels within each ROI), and used to prewhiten the time series. The average voxels of the residual time series was then used as a summary measure for each ROI. This approach was based on the optimised pipeline proposed by <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Geerligs et al. (2017)</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P14">To illustrate our method, we analysed two groups (denoted <italic toggle="yes">j</italic>, i.e. <italic toggle="yes">j</italic>=1, 2) from the Cam-CAN study: the 100 youngest individuals, aged 18–33, and the 100 oldest individuals, aged 74–89 (denoted <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> within each group, i.e. <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> = 1, …, <italic toggle="yes">n<sub>j</sub></italic>, where <italic toggle="yes">n</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic toggle="yes">n</italic><sub>2</sub> = 100).</p>

Absolute thresholding picks a common threshold <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sup>(<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>)</sup> = <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> for each individual. In contrast, proportional thresholding ensures that the same number of edges are present in each network by allowing the threshold to vary by individual.</p>
        <p id="P18">Both thresholding strategies have their drawbacks. Since the number of edges in a network inherently affects the overall network (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Ginestet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">van Wijk et al., 2010</xref>), differences in other network metrics may simply be attributable to variations in the overall connectivity. A proportional threshold may thus be preferred in order to keep the number of edges constant across individuals (in both groups) and facilitate comparison of other metrics of interest. On the other hand, a lower correlation value may be less reliable in indicating a functional connection between brain regions. Therefore, by including lower correlations as edges for individuals with lower overall connectivity, a proportional threshold may induce more randomness in the resulting network (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">van den Heuvel et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P19">Given these issues, we analysed networks constructed using the two different thresholding procedures: absolute and proportional. Further, for both procedures we considered two distinct threshold values (i.e. different <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sup>(<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>)</sup>), chosen to yield average node degrees of <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 3 and <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 5. The value of <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 3 corresponds to the efficiency-cost optimization (ECO) criterion (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Fallani et al., 2017</xref>); this aims to optimise the trade-off between the efficiency of a network and its density, or wiring cost. The value of <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 5 has been used in previous applications of ERGMs to resting-state functional connectivity (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>

Although the posterior distribution is generally not available in a closed-form expression, one may obtain samples from the posterior through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method known as the exchange algorithm (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P24">Under absolute thresholding, our exponential random graph model (which is common to all individuals and groups) uses three summary statistics that have previously been applied to single brain functional connectivity networks (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The three summary statistics used are: number of edges (E); geometrically weighted edgewise shared partners (GWESP); and geometrically weighted non-edgewise shared partners (GWNSP). For the proportional thresholding, we fixed the number of edges and modelled the network using two summary statistics: GWESP and GWNSP.</p>
        <p id="P25">The number of edges <inline-formula><mml:math id="M9" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:msub><mml:mi>∑</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> characterises the sparsity of the network. When using an absolute threshold, it is important to include the number of edges in the model in order to account for differences in the network density across individuals. When using a proportional threshold, however, each individual network is constructed to have a predetermined density. As a result, the number of edges <italic toggle="yes">E</italic> is constrained to be the same across each network. In this case, we therefore opted not to include the summary statistic in the model, constraining the space of networks to those with the same number of edges as those observed. In other words, the model describes a probability distribution over networks with a given average node degree <italic toggle="yes">K</italic>. Note that this in contrast to previous applications of ERGMs in neuroimaging, which include the number of edges in the model despite using a proportional threshold (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p id="P42">We performed analyses for two populations of networks, the first with a single group (young only) and the second with two groups (young and old). Both the one and two group settings were considered under two different thresholding procedures (absolute and proportional) and two different threshold values (chosen to yield average node degrees of <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 3 and <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 5); resulting in eight sets of networks that we analysed using our multi-BERGM framework. In this section we present the results of the analyses performed on the sets of networks constructed under absolute thresholding with a population-wide average node degree of <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 3. The other results can be found in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material</xref>. In the context of this paper the supplementary results are in line with those presented here, except where explicitly stated.</p>

        <title>Single-group mean ERGM parameter estimation</title>
        <p id="P44">We first consider the point estimate of the ERGM parameters, <italic toggle="yes">μ</italic>, for the young only (i.e. single-group setting) under various approaches: our one-level multi-BERGM framework; the mean-BERGM, the mean-GRN BERGM; the median-GRN BERGM; and the distribution of point estimates (posterior sample mean) from a single-BERGM fitted to each individual’s network. Briefly, multi-BERGM fits all the model parameters simultaneously in a multilevel framework; mean-BERGM combines estimates from the separate single-BERGM fits; mean-GRN and median-GRN are single-BERGM fits on the group-representative mean and median networks respectively (see Section 2.5 for details).</p>
        <p id="P45"><xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> presents the three components of <italic toggle="yes">μ</italic> (corresponding to the three summary statistics) showing the mean-BERGM estimate (blue dotted line); the posterior sample means of the one-level multi-BERGM (red line), the mean-GRN BERGM (green dashed line), and the median-GRN BERGM (purple dashed line); and the distribution of posterior sample means for single-BERGM fitted to each individual (grey histogram).</p>
        <p id="P46">The multi-BERGM estimates are very close to the mean-BERGM estimates, i.e. the centre of the posterior mean values across the individual network fits (single-BERGMs). In contrast, the posterior means of the edges and GWESP components for the mean-GRN and median-GRN are in the tails of single-BERGM distribution. Similar results were observed under the proportional thresholding procedures while the estimates under absolute thresholding with average node degree <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 5 were similar under each of the approaches (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary material Fig. A.1</xref>). This suggests that the mean-GRN and median-GRN do not always accurately capture the topological structure of the majority of the individual networks.</p>

        <title>Individual-level covariance under multi-BERGM and single-BERGM</title>
        <p id="P47">We consider the covariance of the posterior distribution of the individual-level parameters for three randomly selected participants under our multi-BERGM approach compared to the distribution from the single-BERGM fits. For each approach, we calculated 95% credible regions for each pair of model components based on the respective posterior samples.</p>
        <p id="P48">While the mean values were similar between the multi-BERGM and single-BERGM distributions, the multi-BERGM yielded tighter credible regions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This illustrates one of the benefits of modelling the networks simultaneously: the borrowing of information across individuals leads to more precise estimates of the model parameters. The credible regions derived from the other thresholding procedures were similar or tighter under multi-BERGM compared to single-BERGM (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary material Fig. A.2</xref>).</p>

        <p id="P49">We consider the covariance of the posterior distribution under our multi-BERGM approach compared to the mean-BERGM distribution constructed from the posterior samples of the single-BERGMs for each individual. From the posterior samples for the multi-BERGM, we calculated 95% credible regions for each pair of model components. For the mean-BERGM approach, we calculate a 95% region from a normal distribution with mean and covariance based on the single-BERGM fits for each individual.</p>
        <p id="P50">While the mean values were similar between the multi-BERGM and mean-BERGM distributions, the multi-BERGM yielded moderately tighter credible regions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).

        <title>Single-group goodness-of-fit under multi-BERGM</title>
        <p id="P51">To assess the goodness-of-fit under multi-BERGM, we simulated networks from the ERGM with parameters taken uniformly at random from the posterior samples. The simulated networks appeared broadly similar to the observed networks in terms of the network metrics we considered: degree distribution, geodesic distance distribution and edgewise-shared partner distribution (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This indicates that the group-level posterior distribution adequately captured the important network characteristics across the entire group of individuals. Similar results were observed under the remaining three thresholding procedures (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary material Figs A.4-A.6</xref>).</p>

        <title>Two-group multi-BERGM: group differences</title>
        <p id="P52">Using a two-level multi-BERGM framework we obtained posteriors for the group-level ERGM parameters. These posterior distributions reveal that network differences between the young group and the old group are driven by differences in the GWNSP parameter (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In particular, the posteriors for the edges and GWESP parameters are almost identical for the two groups, while the GWNSP parameter is markedly larger for the young group. This difference in the group-level GWNSP parameters was also observed under the remaining three thresholding procedures (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs A.8-A.10</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P53">By considering the posterior distribution of difference in the group-level parameters, <italic toggle="yes">μ</italic><sub>1</sub> – <italic toggle="yes">μ</italic><sub>2</sub>, we also calculated 95% credible regions to assess the degree of certainty in the group differences under both the multi-BERGM and the mean-BERGM approaches (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The left panel shows that difference in the (edges-GWESP) pair of parameters is centered on zero, while the middle and right panels demonstrate that, under the multi-BERGM approach, the credible regions for the (GWESP-GWNSP) and (GWNSP-edges) pair do not contain zero. This provides evidence that the group-level differences in network structure are driven by the differences in GWNSP. We note that a permutation testing approach based on single-BERGM and single-ERGM fits also found the strongest group difference between the GWNSP parameter estimates (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table A.1</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P54">Under the mean-BERGM approach, the credible regions are slightly wider and contain zero for each pair of parameters. This again high-lights the benefit of more precise estimates of the model parameters via the multi-BERGM approach by modelling the networks simultaneously. Similar results were observed under absolute thresholding with average node degree <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 5 but no significant differences were found under proportional thresholding (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. A.11</xref>)</p>
        <p id="P55">Age-related differences in both local efficiency (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Achard and Bullmore, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Geerligs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Sala-Llonch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2014</xref>) and global efficiency (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Achard and Bullmore, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Sala-Llonch et al., 2014</xref>) have previously been observed. To check whether the multi-BERGM approach could identify similar age-related group differences, we also simulated <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> = 1000 networks for each group from the ERGM with parameters taken uniformly at random from the group-level posterior samples. Overall, the simulated networks for the young group exhibited higher global and local efficiency, in correspondence with the observed data (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Similar results were observed for networks constructed via absolute thresholding with average node degree <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 5 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. A.12</xref>). Under proportional thresholding, however, the posterior predictive distribution of local and global efficiency did not correspond well with the observed networks, indicating a poor model fit (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs A.13 and A.14</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P56">Based on the results from previous sections, we have shown that the various GRN methods do not properly reflect the distribution of individual ERGMs, and hence we do not consider group differences under these alternative approaches.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P57">The characterisation of connectivity structure at a group level is a necessary step towards understanding how the brain changes with a given phenotype such as age, disease condition or mental state. We have proposed multi-BERGM, a multi-level (hierarchical) Bayesian framework based on exponential random graph models (ERGMs), as a coherent method for understanding group level connectivity. By pooling information across the individual networks, this framework provides a principled (and extendable) approach to model the relational structure for groups of networks.</p>
      <p id="P58">Our work builds on previous approaches attempting to investigate differences between groups of networks, either by constructing a group-representative network (GRN; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Achard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Joyce et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Meunier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Sinke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2009</xref>) or by combining separate individual-level estimates, e.g. mean-ERGM (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Obando and Fallani, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2012</xref>). There are three main advantages of our framework: using the Bayesian paradigm allows us to formally quantify uncertainty in the group-level model parameters; the group-level posterior densities provide a way to directly compare connectivity structure across groups; and the multi-level (hierarchical) framework allows information to be borrowed across individuals thus, in principle, improving the accuracy of the parameter estimates.</p>
      <p id="P59">In line with previous findings (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Ginestet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2012</xref>), our results illustrate that the mean-GRN and median-GRN approaches for constructing group-representative networks do not accurately characterise the topological structure of the individual networks. This is at least partially due to the <italic toggle="yes">quasi</italic> linearity of the thresholding operation used to construct the networks: the expectation of thresholded correlation matrices will not in general be equal to the network constructed by thresholding the expectation of the correlation matrices (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Ginestet et al., 2011</xref>). As a result, the network metrics from such a GRN will not accurately summarise the topological information across the individual networks.</p>
      <p id="P60">Our proposed method takes as input any group of unweighted networks. While there are a variety of methods to construct networks from functional neuroimaging data, each with their own benefits and disadvantages, we took the most common and simple approach of applying a threshold to the correlation matrices, keeping edges between nodes that exhibited a sufficiently strong positive correlation. The choice of threshold can have a significant impact on the resulting connectivity structure (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">van den Heuvel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">van Wijk et al., 2010</xref>) and we found that different threshold values did indeed lead to small differences in the posterior distribution of the model parameter. Regardless of the threshold used, our approach provides a framework to characterise the group-level brain connectivity structure, though further investigation into the effect of thresholding procedure on ERGM parameter estimates is warranted.</p>
      <p id="P61">From a modelling perspective, the appropriate selection of summary statistics is crucial. This is true of fitting ERGMs to single networks, let alone populations of networks. Moreover, the ‘correct’ choice likely depends on the network construction method. We used three summary statistics: the number of edges, the geometrically-weighted edgewise shared partners (GWESP) statistic and the geometrically-weighted non-edgewise shared partners (GWNSP) statistic. The choice of summary statistics follows <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al. (2011)</xref>, in which this particular combination was selected via a graphical goodness-of-fit approach, with the ‘best’ metrics chosen from a prespecified set of potential metrics. While it is possible to perform Bayesian model selection for an ERGM on a single network (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bouranis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Caimo and Friel, 2013</xref>), further work is needed to extend these approaches to perform model selection for a group of networks.</p>
      <p id="P62">Although ERGMs provide a concise representation of network data via a set of summary statistics, the biological interpretation of these summary statistics requires some care. The number of edges corresponds to overall network density and is a natural measure of connectedness. The GWESP/GWNSP statistics are weighted sums of the number of connected/non-connected node pairs having exactly <italic toggle="yes">w</italic> shared partners. The GWESP statistic quantifies the propensity to form triangles and is thus a measure of local clustering (functional segregation). The GWNSP statistic can be seen as an indirect measure of global network efficiency (functional integration); a higher value of GWNSP indicates that non-connected nodes are more likely to have a shared partner. Both GWNSP and GWESP were highly correlated with local as well as global network efficiency (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table A.2</xref>) for the 200 networks constructed under absolute thresholding with average node degree <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 3. This is in line with previous work (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Obando and Fallani, 2017</xref>) which concluded that it may not be possible to uniquely relate GWNSP and GWESP to global and local efficiency respectively. Note however that GWESP and GWNSP were also highly correlated with each other. In fact, when Spearman’s <italic toggle="yes">partial</italic> correlation is used, the correlation between GWNSP and local efficiency (controlling for GWESP) is close to zero while the correlation between GWNSP and global efficiency is still strong (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables A.3-A.4</xref>). Similarly, the correlation between GWESP and local efficiency (controlling for GWNSP) is close to zero while the correlation between GWESP and global efficiency is moderately large. These results indicate that GWNSP and GWESP are indeed useful surrogates for global and local efficiency respectively.</p>
      <p id="P63">The parameter estimates obtained from the fitting procedure quantify the relative influence of the corresponding summary statistics on the overall network structure. To be precise, the parameter estimates represent the estimated change in log-odds of an edge existing for each unit increase of the corresponding summary statistic. The negative estimates for the edges parameter corresponds to a lower expected edge density relative to a random graph in which each edge exists with probability 1/2. Note that this relates strongly to the overall sparsity of the network and is thus highly dependent on the threshold level used. The positive estimates for the GWESP parameter indicate that many connections contribute to the formation of clusters in the brain. This corresponds to the well-established local efficiency and functional segregation of the brain (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</xref>). The negative estimates for the GWNSP parameter suggest that pairs of non-connected nodes sharing one or more neighbours are relatively uncommon. The lower estimates of this parameter for the old group indicate lower levels of functional integration. Note that the parameter estimates, as well as the corresponding summary statistics, are strongly correlated, so caution should be exercised when interpreting the estimates independently.</p>
      <p id="P64">A graphical assessment of the model indicated a reasonable goodness-of-fit under constant thresholding. In particular, the model was able to recover differences in observed global and local efficiency, which were both higher in the young group than the old group. The observed age-related decrease in local efficiency is in line with previous studies (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Achard and Bullmore, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Geerligs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Sala-Llonch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2014</xref>). A decline in global efficiency has also been observed previously (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Achard and Bullmore, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Sala-Llonch et al., 2014</xref>), though not in other studies (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Geerligs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, the thresholding method had a pronounced effect on the observed age-differences. Under constant thresholding, we observed a clear difference in global efficiency between the two age groups and a relatively small difference in local efficiency. Under proportional thresholding, however, both local and global efficiency were slightly lower for the young group. The disparities between thresholding procedures may be associated with alterations in mean connectivity due to age-related differences in vascular health (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Geerligs et al., 2017</xref>), while the discrepancies with previous studies are likely due to differences in network construction including the par-cellation and definition of functional connectivity.</p>
      <p id="P65">Future research will be needed to extend our approach to alternative settings. For example, the flexibility of Bayesian hierarchical modelling could be exploited to deal with continuous covariates or more complex group structures such as factorial designs. Given multiple networks per individual, one could extend the framework by adding another layer to the model. Specifically, one could again posit an ERGM for each network observation, with individual-level parameters to pool information for networks on the same individual and group-level parameters to pool information across several individuals. It would then be possible to apply our framework to dynamic functional connectivity or task-based scans in order to query how connectivity structure changes with time or across states. Although our framework is currently limited to binary networks, more work is needed to handle weighted networks (thus bypassing the thresholding issue). A promising avenue for this is the development of weighted ERGMs (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Desmarais and Cranmer, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>), though the associated computational cost is likely to be prohibitive.</p>
      <p id="P66">A downside to our framework, especially compared to the single-(B)ERGM and GRN approaches, is in terms of computation cost. Using a 40-core computing cluster (Intel Xeon E7-8860 v3, 2.2 GHz), the algorithm took between 8 and 12 h to produce the posterior samples for each multi-BERGM (with additional time to tune the Bayesian procedure). However, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Krivitsky and Handcock (2014)</xref> provide empirical evidence suggesting the computational cost may grow on the order of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>) log(<italic toggle="yes">E</italic>) where <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> is the number of summary statistics, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> is the number of nodes, and <italic toggle="yes">E</italic> is the (typical) number of edges (as well as increase roughly linearly in the number of networks, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>). In practical terms this limits the size of networks that our framework can currently handle to relatively coarse parcellations of the brain (approximately 100 regions). Note that the computational cost also increases with the density of the networks. The efficiency cost optimisation (ECO) criterion, corresponding to an average node degree of <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> = 3, offers a principled threshold that yields sparse networks while maintaining their essential structure (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Fallani et al., 2017</xref>). Improving the efficiency of fitting (B)ERGMs is an ongoing area of research (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Bouranis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Cerqueira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Tan and Friel, 2020</xref>) and our framework will benefit from ongoing developments and may be applicable to more spatially resolved networks in the future.

        <p>A diagrammatic representation of the hierarchical framework.

The histogram (grey bars) corresponds to the single-BERGM posterior mean values of the model parameters fitted to each of the <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 100 individual networks. The vertical lines correspond to the posterior mean values of group-level mean parameter under multi-BERGM (red line), mean-BERGM (blue dotted line), mean-GRN BERGM (green dashed line) and median-GRN BERGM (purple dashed line). For each of the model components, the posterior mean under multi-BERGM lay close to the mean-BERGM estimate, i.e. the centre of the single-BERGM mean values. In contrast, for the edges and GWESP components, posterior means for the mean-GRN BERGM and median-GRN BERGM lay in the tails of the single-BERGM mean values.</p>
