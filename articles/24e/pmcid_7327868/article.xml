        <p>Altered cerebral blood flow (CBF), as measured by arterial spin labelling (ASL), has been observed in several psychiatric conditions, but is a generally underutilized MRI technique, especially in the study of psychosis spectrum (PS) symptoms. We aimed to determine group differences in ASL resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between PS and non-PS youth, and the reliability of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained on ASL rsFC features to differentiate PS and non-PS youth, especially compared to blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. 1146 youth aged 8–22 with ASL and BOLD data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort were analyzed. Widespread ASL hyperconnectivity was found in the left cuneus, precuneus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and hypoconnectivity was found in the left cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal area (multiple linear regression, FDR corrected). An SVM trained on ASL and BOLD features outperformed either modality alone (AUC<sub>BOTH</sub> = 0.72 versus AUC<sub>ASL</sub> = 0.68 and AUC<sub>BOLD</sub> = 0.67). Classification performance and precision improved when the non-PS group had no psychiatric comorbidities. The relative success of the classifier suggests ASL rsFC changes exist in PS individuals that differ from BOLD rsFC changes, and extends previous findings of CBF dysregulation in PS.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="p0020">Effective interventions are available for early psychosis (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Birchwood et al., 1998</xref>). However, efforts at primary or secondary prevention of a first episode of psychosis have proved challenging (<xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Fusar-Poli, 2013</xref>), including in the “clinical high-risk” (CHR) population, which even if successful would apply to a small minority of incident first episode cases. Therefore, the need to identify individuals before symptoms and more severe functioning impairments fully manifest remains a high priority. The use of machine learning classification coupled with advanced brain imaging techniques offers promise to detect subtle, high-dimensional differences in functional brain activity for PS youth, and may provide insight into underlying neurobiology and mechanisms of psychosis risk. Further, assessing performance of classification models in PS youth provides a more realistic appraisal of the potential for future generation of identification tools early in impairment, and well before schizophrenia, first episode psychosis, or even the clinical high-risk state.</p>
      <p id="p0025">Some success in applying methods to identify CHR individuals has been achieved (<xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Cannon et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Koutsouleris et al., 2012</xref>). Work by Koutsouleris and colleagues has shown that support vector machines (SVMs) applied to structural MRI data can achieve high accuracy in differentiating between healthy controls (HCs) and individuals who exhibit both early and late at-risk mental states (ARMS) for psychosis (<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Koutsouleris et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Koutsouleris et al., 2012</xref>). However, the majority of work using machine learning in the early stages of psychosis is based on structural neuroimaging (<xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Satterthwaite et al., 2016</xref>): there is little functional neuroimaging, and to our knowledge no use of arterial spin labeling (ASL) to classify those who may be suffering from dimensional psychosis symptoms (a group that has significant overlap with but is distinct from the CHR group), despite evidence that it may be a useful biomarker for regional resting state brain function (<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Detre et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p id="p0030">The Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) is a community-based sample of children and youth (of which ~20% meet criteria for having PS symptoms) with multimodal neuroimaging data (n = 1445) including both resting state blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI as well as ASL data (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Calkins et al., 2014</xref>). Such a large sample provides an opportunity to study cerebral blood flow differences in PS youth and test prediction accuracy with a greater level of confidence. Given the understudied nature of ASL fMRI and the fact that it possesses signal characteristics which may lend themselves to improved detection of network differences in PS youth even beyond what BOLD can detect (<xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2003</xref>), new knowledge may be generated by investigating classification performance using this modality.</p>
      <p id="p0035">Additionally, developmental sex differences related to brain structure (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Gennatas et al., 2017</xref>) and connectivity (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Gur and Gur, 2016</xref>) have been observed in typically developing youth, including changes in cerebral perfusion as measured by ASL (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Kaczkurkin et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Satterthwaite et al., 2014</xref>). A variety of sex differences are present in schizophrenia (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Mendrek and Mancini-Marïe, 2016</xref>) that extend to earlier stages of psychosis risk (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Barajas et al., 2015</xref>), including sex and age dependent differences in brain structure and resting-state fMRI connectivity that have been found in PS youth (<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Jacobs et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, analyses examining sex differences in ASL may provide insight into the neurobiological basis of PS symptoms in youth.</p>
      <p id="p0040">The first aim of this study is to describe differences in connectivity between psychosis spectrum (PS) and non-PS groups using ASL resting state functional connectivity (rsFC), and determine the ability of a support vector machine classifier trained on ASL rsFC data to differentiate between these groups. Performance will also be compared with a classifier trained on BOLD rsFC data from the same subjects, as well as one trained on a concatenation of BOLD and ASL rsFC. We hypothesize that classification of PS youth using ASL will be as successful as that using BOLD, but may reveal that some individuals are more accurately classified using one technique or the other. Given that developmental sex differences have been observed in ASL regionally, the second aim of this study is to investigate sex-based differences in ASL rsFC, and compare performance of models trained on exclusively male or female ASL rsFC data. Here, we hypothesize that the ASL classifier may perform differently for boys and girls (when differentiating between PS vs. non-PS).</p>

        <title>Participant recruitment and characterization</title>
        <p id="p0045">As described in detail elsewhere e.g., (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Calkins et al., 2015</xref>), the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) is a large (n = 9428), cross-sectional population sample of youth (aged 8–22) that includes a wide range of neuroimaging, genetic, neurocognitive, and demographic data. Recruitment procedures for this catchment area cohort have been previously described (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Calkins et al., 2014</xref>). All participants provided written informed consent. For youth under 18, both written informed consent and parental/legal guardian permission were acquired. The University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Review Boards approved all procedures. 1445 of these subjects were stratified for age and sex and randomly selected for neuroimaging. Of these subjects, a subset was excluded on the basis of missing or poor quality fMRI data, as well as missing demographic or instrument data. 243 subjects had missing or unusable BOLD fMRI data, and a further 56 subjects had missing or unusable ASL fMRI data (some excluded subjects were also missing demographic data, but all subjects with usable BOLD and ASL data had demographic data). This resulted in n = 1146 with usable ASL and BOLD fMRI data, in addition to all necessary demographic data (see <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<table-wrap position="float" id="t0005"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary statistics of psychosis spectrum and non-psychosis spectrum youth with usable ASL and BOLD imaging data.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Demographic/Clinical Characteristics</th><th>nonPS</th><th>PS</th><th>p value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>n (%)</td><td>882 (76.96)</td><td>264 (23.04)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Age (years, mean ± SD)</td><td>14.71 (3.46)</td><td>14.92 (2.88)</td><td>0.363</td></tr><tr><td>Sex (% female)</td><td>54.4</td><td>51.9</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity (% European American)</td><td>51.3</td><td>33.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>WRAT-4 Standard Reading Score (mean (SD))</td><td>53.23 (9.30)</td><td>50.69 (8.91)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td>PRIME Screen Revised total score (mean (SD))</td><td>3.85 (6.00)</td><td>23.33 (13.99)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td>SOPS total score (mean (SD))</td><td>1.44 (1.82)</td><td>5.04 (4.50)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Children's Global Assessment Scale, current (mean (SD))</td><td>82.58 (9.82)</td><td>72.51 (12.82)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Maternal education (years, mean (SD))</td><td>14.46 (2.50)</td><td>13.72 (2.24)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Paternal education (years, mean (SD))</td><td>14.16 (2.74)</td><td>13.38 (2.53)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

        <title>Image preprocessing - ASL and BOLD fMRI</title>
        <p id="p0105">The ASL data as received from the Philadelphia group was already motion corrected. Beyond this, data was preprocessed in a way similar to previous ASL connectivity studies (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Loggia et al., 2013</xref>), using FSL (FMRIB’s Software Library) (<xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2004</xref>) and AFNI (Analysis of Functional Neuroimages) (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Cox, 1996</xref>).</p>
        <p id="p0110">ASL data was skull-stripped using the FSL brain extraction tool (BET). Adjacent tag and control images were subtracted using a custom script to obtain a perfusion signal. FSL FLIRT was used to register the ASL data to a high resolution anatomical volume (T1), and then transform the data to MNI152 standard space. Data was also high-pass filtered at 0.008 Hz using a 4th order Butterworth filter and spatially smoothed at FWHM = 5 mm using AFNI, consistent with preprocessing in other studies (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Loggia et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
        <p id="p0115">BOLD data was preprocessed using standard methods (<xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Satterthwaite et al., 2015</xref>). The first 4 volumes were removed to allow for signal stabilization, and the remaining volumes were skull-stripped using BET, registered to a T1 volume, and transformed to MNI152 standard space using FSL FLIRT. Data was band-pass filtered to allow frequencies between 0.01 and 0.08 Hz using a 4th order Butterworth filter. Time points (TRs) with a framewise displacement of &gt; 0.25 mm/TR were replaced with a linear interpolation of the two closest surviving TRs.</p>
        <p id="p0120">In all cases, visual quality control (QC) was performed.

High-motion subjects were identified on the basis of number of TRs retained in the BOLD scans after TR scrubbing. Out of 120 TRs, if fewer than 100 TRs were retained, the subject was considered to be “high-motion” and was excluded (although this TR scrubbing step was performed only on BOLD scans, subjects that did not pass the 100 TR threshold were also excluded from ASL analyses).</p>

A whole-brain, graph-theory-based parcellation (<xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2013</xref>) was used to define volumetric regions of interest (ROIs) for connectivity analyses.

The atlas was downsampled to match the resolution of the functional images (91×109×91).

To remove redundant features, pairwise correlations were calculated across all subjects within each fold for all features, and connections that had a correlation coefficient of greater than 0.85 with at least one other connection were dropped (the number of features dropped this way ranged from 2122 to 2865 for each fold). Other groups have investigated feature selection in fMRI data (<xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et al., 2009</xref>), and have found that an ANOVA F-value ranking of features based on differences between classes can work well for BOLD fMRI classification. Correspondingly, features were ranked according to their F-value on the training data within each of 10 cross-validation folds after the removal of correlated features, and the top 50% of features were retained in each case (resulting in approximately 10,000 features in each fold; range: 9963 to 10,334).</p>

As well, the analysis was repeated with age as a covariate in the regression.

        <title>Support vector machine training and validation</title>
        <p id="p0150">Classifier training was performed using scikit-learn (version 0.18.1) (<xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>), which includes a Python implementation of Libsvm (<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>). For both BOLD and ASL data, a linear-kernel SVM classifier was trained using the selected features. L2 regularization that occurs during SVM training makes SVMs relatively less sensitive to overfitting (which would otherwise be a danger due to a small number of samples with a much larger number of highly variable features) (<xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Scholkopf and Smola, 2001</xref>). The PNC is a very large dataset in the context of neuroimaging, but relatively small compared to a typical machine learning classification problem, and thus SVMs were considered to be a good model choice to ameliorate the effects of a lack of samples. Grid search hyperparameter selection was performed for the value of C, where C ∈ {10<sup>−6</sup>, 10<sup>−5</sup>, …, 10<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>}. A class imbalance existed between PS and non-PS groups (with PS making up 23.04% of the entire sample with roughly equal males and females), and thus classes were weighted inversely proportional to frequency during training, which resulted in increased sensitivity of the classifier at the expense of specificity. 10-fold stratified cross validation was performed, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) across all folds was calculated for each model, as well as a precision-recall curve and a confusion matrix.</p>
        <p id="p0155">Three models were trained: one with ASL rsFC data, one with BOLD rsFC data, and a third using a concatenation of the ASL and BOLD rsFC data (using the same set of ROIs for each).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="p0225">In this study, we found that an SVM classifier trained on ASL connectivity data could differentiate between PS and non-PS youth with reasonable accuracy (mean AUC = 0.68), and to a level not statistically different than BOLD connectivity (mean AUC = 0.67). When ASL and BOLD rsFC were concatenated prior to feature selection, the classifier performed better than either modality alone (mean AUC = 0.72). To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the discriminative power of ASL connectivity in youth with early psychosis symptoms, who are largely unmedicated and absent many confounds of clinical samples. The combined ASL and BOLD classifier’s performance improved further when PS youth were compared to typically developing youth (mean AUC = 0.72, with a much more balanced precision-recall curve). An AUC of 0.72 with a balanced precision-recall curve comparing youth with subthreshold symptoms to healthy youth is relatively excellent, and may in part be due to our use of network connectivity of fMRI and ASL, rather than region of interest estimates.</p>
      <p id="p0230">Our results provide some evidence that ASL and BOLD could be complementary modalities to further improve prediction. Our model trained on a concatenation of ASL and BOLD rsFC performed significantly better than BOLD rsFC after feature selection, suggesting some mutually exclusive information relevant to PS is being captured by both modalities. Most machine learning classification work in groups at-risk for psychosis has been conducted using largely structural and neuropsychological data, with comparatively little using fMRI, and essentially none using ASL despite its ease of use and brief acquisition time. Calhoun's group found that some network properties (connectivity strength and clustering coefficients) of BOLD rsFC differed between a group of 24 healthy controls and a group of 24 schizophrenia patients, suggesting classification could be possible, and others have confirmed this (<xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). Though the modalities have similarities, ASL fMRI has different signal characteristics compared to BOLD fMRI (<xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). It has been shown to have a more stable noise profile across the frequency spectrum (whereas BOLD is skewed toward low frequency noise), and lower inter-subject variability for task and resting state activation (see <xref rid="s0105" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). Further, the present study’s large size and opportunity to compare PS youth to a population sample provides a higher confidence that the results are generalizable.</p>
      <p id="p0235">In our results, the most discriminative connections across folds in the ASL and BOLD models appear to involve different brain regions (see <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>): the important ASL connections are within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and several areas within visual and premotor cortex, while the important BOLD connections are found in superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area), several areas within the frontal and parietal lobe, and the posterior and anterior cingulate. Some of these areas are consistent with previous network dysfunction work in schizophrenia: altered connectivity in the cingulate is consistently found, as is altered connectivity in parietal regions (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Bluhm et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Garrity et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Lynall et al., 2010</xref>). At a network level, the important BOLD features seem to represent altered fronto-parietal and default mode network connectivity, while the important ASL features seem to represent mainly altered salience and visual attention network connectivity. Interestingly, the important connections are slightly different in the combined model and draw from both modalities.</p>
      <p id="p0240">There are several reasons why connections may have different feature importances depending on modality. Firstly, the aforementioned ASL signal differences may be more sensitive to different network dysfunction than BOLD; altered CBF functional connectivity has recently been found in regions which include the salience and visual attention networks (<xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al., 2018</xref>), and this could be characteristic of CBF in schizophrenia (see <xref rid="s0105" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). Secondly, although collected at the same site, differences in the data collection protocol between modalities could have resulted in the emphasis or de-emphasis of certain connections (notably, 124 BOLD volumes were collected for each subject, but only 40 spin-labeled and 40 control ASL volumes were collected).</p>
      <p id="p0245">Beyond differences in signal characteristics, ASL and BOLD capture fundamentally different phenomena, and the distinction between these phenomena is especially relevant in the developmental period. Indeed, this is a large motivation for developing simultaneous ASL and BOLD MRI acquisition sequences for developmental populations, and authors have speculated that given the rapid rate of development both neurovascularly and neurocognitively in these populations, having access to both at a single timepoint could be very useful for isolating true differences in neurocognition (<xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Schmithorst et al., 2014</xref>). Theoretically, the combination of both modalities allows one to determine the extent to which an increased BOLD signal is due to increased CBF versus decreased neuronal oxygen demand at that location. Other authors have done this explicitly, by estimating oxygen metabolic rate using the BOLD signal, ASL signal, blood volume, and Fick’s law (see e.g., Davis et al. where this was done in humans; <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 1998</xref>). Though we have chosen not to make any a priori assumptions regarding the importance of each modality type and have included all connections in our model, it is possible that we are also implicitly taking advantage of the BOLD signal while taking CBF into account as a confound, through our feature selection process which includes the dropping of correlated features.</p>
      <p id="p0250">We also examined model classification performance in males and females separately, given that sex-based developmental differences in CBF have previously been observed (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Kaczkurkin et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Satterthwaite et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Taki et al., 2011</xref>). We found that females were classified more accurately in all three models. A follow-up analysis, however, revealed that the female group had significantly lower head motion (as measured by mean FD), and that the statistical significance of sex in a logistic regression model of correct classification disappeared when mean FD was taken into account. Thus, the observed differences originally thought to be due to sex are likely due to decreased motion artifacts in females; however, it cannot be ruled out that performance differences would still be observed even if the male group had minimal average head motion. Satterthwaite and colleagues have shown that CBF has a marked age-sex interaction in the inferior parietal lobe, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), insula, and other areas, with developmental trajectories between males and females diverging after puberty. Since psychosis spectrum disorders typically have a post-puberty onset and a marked sex difference (with prevalence in males being higher than females) (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Aleman et al., 2003</xref>), one might expect classification performance to differ between sexes especially post-puberty, but we were not able to confirm this due to the group difference in head motion. Even so, our results show that especially in low motion individuals, regardless of sex, ASL has reasonable predictive accuracy for differentiating between PS and non-PS groups.</p>
      <p id="p0255">Some limitations of our results should be kept in mind. Firstly, the data we used from the PNC was cross-sectional and represents only a single “snapshot” of brain function, and thus we must be cautious with extending our results to the prediction of future states in the same individual. Perhaps more importantly, the definition of the psychosis spectrum group was based on scores from the PRIME, KSADS and SOPS and is not a formal diagnosis (as explained, this may have actually hampered classifier performance). If more information about the severity of symptoms existed for each subject (especially data that was not self-reported), it is likely that a cleaner distinction could be made between PS and non-PS groups. Additionally, as mentioned, a group difference in head motion between sexes impaired our ability to investigate functional connectivity differences between sexes in more detail. Strengths of the PNC dataset include the fact that the sample is largely unmedicated and substance-naive, and the age range (8–22) represents a demographic that has not been studied extensively in the transition to psychosis literature (while also being an especially important demographic to investigate in order to understand risk of transitioning to psychosis in individuals that do not pass through the “clinical high-risk” state).</p>
      <p id="p0260">It should be emphasized that all subjects in the PNC have not been formally diagnosed with a psychosis spectrum disorder or as CHR, and thus our task is different (and fundamentally more difficult) than if we had access to ASL and BOLD fMRI data from individuals with more severe psychosis symptoms and a diagnosis. By repeating our methods on such a population, it is likely that differentiability would increase. Along a similar line of reasoning, we saw that performance classifying PS versus TD youth was slightly superior compared to PS versus non-PS youth, even with less data. If a greater amount of TD youth data could be obtained, it is likely this improvement would become statistically significant.</p>
      <p id="p0265">Our results can be extended in several ways. Our classification analysis between PS and non-PS groups could be extended to a regression analysis, predicting not only class membership but symptom severity or Global Functioning score. This would be useful for identifying the highest risk individuals within the PS group and connectivity features differentiating them, and is a more representative metric of risk for individuals close to the decision boundary. Additionally, it is possible both classification and regression performance could be improved with different model types and feature selection techniques, especially involving deep neural networks (DNNs), which have been used in classification of schizophrenia from BOLD fMRI (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Though fMRI data is not currently collected for this kind of risk assessment clinically, the baseline Global Functioning: Social and Roles scores are easily obtained in a primary care setting and, in the future, could identify candidates for further, more comprehensive risk assessment with fMRI. Building on previous work that effectively utilizes clinical and structural neuroimaging data, there is a strong possibility that combining this data with fMRI modalities for the same individual would lead to more accurate results in PS youth. A recent comprehensive study by Koutsouleris and colleagues (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Koutsouleris et al., 2018</xref>) showed that by combining predictions from baseline scores on the Global Functioning: Social and Roles scales (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Cornblatt et al., 2007</xref>) and grey matter volumes (GMV) in CHR youth using stacked generalization (<xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">Wolpert, 1992</xref>), functional outcome was predicted more accurately than with baseline clinical scores or GMV alone. It remains to be seen if our model could be combined with either similar clinical or structural data (or both) using the same method to improve performance, but this appears to be a promising line of research. Follow up work could validate our findings clinically, by collecting ASL and BOLD data from individuals with poor Global Functioning: Social and Roles baseline scores, determining if classifiers trained on concatenated ASL and BOLD connectivity data could improve outcome prediction compared to baseline scores alone, and if so, if the degree of improvement justifies the cost of additional testing.</p>
