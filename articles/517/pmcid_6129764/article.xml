      <abstract>
        <p>Data processing toolboxes for resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) have provided us with a variety of functions and user friendly graphic user interfaces (GUIs). However, many toolboxes only cover a certain range of functions, and use exclusively designed GUIs. To facilitate data processing and alleviate the burden of manually drawing GUIs, we have developed a versatile and extendable MATLAB-based toolbox, BRANT (BRAinNetome fmri Toolkit), with a wide range of rs-fMRI data processing functions and code-generated GUIs. During the implementation, we have also empowered the toolbox with parallel computing techniques, efficient file handling methods for compressed file format, and one-line scripting. In BRANT, users can find rs-fMRI batch processing functions for preprocessing, brain spontaneous activity analysis, functional connectivity analysis, complex network analysis, statistical analysis, and results visualization, while developers can quickly publish scripts with code-generated GUIs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been studied intensively not only as a reference for task fMRI but also as a technique to detect intrinsically synchronized signals among brain areas (Fox et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Rs-fMRI signals are reconstructed from blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which fluctuate with the ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin in the vicinity (Ogawa et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). To study rs-fMRI signals, a great number of methods and software such as Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) (Ashburner, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), FMRIB Software Library (FSL) (Smith et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) (Cox, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) have been developed to provide users executable software, scripts and graphic user interfaces (GUIs) for data preprocessing, metrics calculation, statistical analysis, and results visualization. And to facilitate data preprocessing, software packages such as the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/">http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/</ext-link>), the minimal preprocessing pipelines (Glasser et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), the toolbox for Data Processing &amp; Analysis for Brain Imaging (DPABI) (Yan et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), CONN (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and the GRaph thEoreTical Network Analysis (GRETNA) toolbox (Wang et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), have integrated functions of SPM, FSL and AFNI into their pipelines for batch preprocessing. After preprocessing steps such as temporal corrections, spatial alignment, space registrations, and noise removal, rs-fMRI signals can be further processed by measuring temporal, frequential, and spatial properties. Frequently used methods can be coarsely categorized as, but not restricted to, functional connectivity-based methods, complex network-based methods, and voxel-wise spontaneous activity-based methods. Functional connectivity-based methods are used to calculate pair-wise properties such as temporal dependency (Biswal et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>), coherence (Sun et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and maximum information coefficient (Reshef et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), between regions of interest (ROIs) or between seed ROI and whole-brain voxels. Given a connectivity matrix, complex network-based methods can be used to capture the topological properties of the entire network, as well as its components (subgraphs, nodes, and edges). With increased computing capability, voxel-wise methods have been implemented to describe temporal, frequently and spatial profiles of each voxel's time series (Zang et al., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Tomasi and Volkow, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). To test hypothesis, statistical analysis methods are used, and to present results, visualization methods are implemented as displaying slices, projecting volumes, rendering surfaces, plotting topological connectivity, and etc. Most of the above mentioned methods are implemented in SPM (Ashburner, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), FSL (Smith et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), AFNI (Cox, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), Network Based Statistic (NBS) (Zalesky et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) (Rubinov and Sporns, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), CONN (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), REST (Song et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), DPABI (Yan et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), GRETNA (Wang et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), xjView (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alivelearn.net/xjview">http://www.alivelearn.net/xjview</ext-link>), Caret (Van Essen et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), Connectome Workbench (Marcus et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), BrainNet Viewer (Xia et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and MRIcron/Mricro (Rorden and Brett, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Different software packages have provided us with efficient batch processing pipelines which can be run by clicking on GUIs instead of writing scripts. However, in most of the above-mentioned software, the number of functions is fixed and GUIs are exclusively designed. During data processing, users would need to turn to multiple software packages and sometimes write scripts for batch processing. To facilitate data processing, we have written a versatile and extendable MATLAB-based toolbox, BRANT (BRAinNetome fmri Toolkit, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://brant.brainnetome.org">https://brant.brainnetome.org</ext-link>), which integrates batch processing pipelines for rs-fMRI data preprocessing, voxel-wise spontaneous activity analysis, functional connectivity analysis, complex network analysis, as well as statistical analysis and results visualization. In BRANT, we designed the GUIs to be code-generated, which requires only a few lines of MATLAB code to add new functions. We have also optimized computing-related scripts by matrix operations, parallel computing techniques and multithreading, and optimized file-handling-related scripts by MATLAB-C++ compiled <sup>*</sup>.mex executives that load and save gzipped files directly.</p>
      <p>In the following paragraphs, we at first describe the functions of BRANT in theory and formula, then we demonstrate the examples of code-generated GUI design in the cases of Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and two third-party software. In the end, we compare BRANT with three other frequently used MATLAB-based rs-fMRI data processing software and discuss the advantages and limitations of our toolbox.</p>

        <title>Overview</title>
        <p>The main part of BRANT is composed of MATLAB scripts and code-generated GUIs. To simplify the input process, most functions are initialized with default settings, and users will only need to specify several necessary parameters, with free access to all. Functions of BRANT are arranged into 7 modules, which are preprocessing, functional connectivity (FC), spontaneous activity (SPON), complex network analysis (NET), statistics (STAT), visualization (View), and utilities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Preprocessing</title>
        <p>Raw data collected from MR scanners are formatted as DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files, and each file stores the intensity of one volume or one slice. To process data more efficiently, DICOM files are firstly converted to a single 4D NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) image by <italic>dcm2nii</italic> in MRIcron (Rorden and Brett, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), which has been well-tested and is known within the community as being stable and fast (Jenkinson et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). For converted data, visual inspection is recommended to censor data with low quality (artifacts and distortions). Qualified data can be further processed in the preprocessing pipeline. Since SPM (Ashburner, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) has implemented preprocessing functions that are widely used by most MATLAB-based toolboxes, we follow the convention and use SPM's built-in scripts for slice timing correction, realignment, co-registration, spatial normalization and smoothing, along with our <italic>Denoise</italic> scripts for covariates regression and band-pass filtering in the batch preprocessing pipeline.</p>
        <p>In <italic>Denoise</italic>, time series of one subject's 4D volume is extracted and reshaped to a temporal-spatial 2D matrix as the input of a multiple regression model and a square-wave filter. In the regression model, physiological noises and head motion effects addressed by Friston et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) and Power et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) are used as noise regressors, which include linear trend, mean time series extracted from tissue masks (white matter WM, cerebrospinal fluid CSF, and global signal GS, denoted as <italic>T</italic>) and estimated head-motion parameters (<italic>R</italic>, 3 translational and 3 rotational estimates output by <italic>Realign</italic>), variant forms of <italic>T</italic> and <italic>R</italic>, as well as all the squared forms of the above regressors. The variant forms include the first derivatives with zero padding and 1-frame lagged time series with zero padding. Each noise regressor is optional, and can be packed into the different regression models suggested in (Ciric et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Since whether to regress out global signal is controversial (Fox et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Murphy et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Hahamy et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), an option is offered to perform either or both operations. Before the regression model, an optional strategy called <italic>scrubbing</italic> is implemented to censor large motion frames with a threshold of the FD (framewise displacement) (Power et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>

          <p><italic>Draw ROIs</italic> is implemented as automatically drawing spheres or cubes with ROI coordinates and a header reference 3D image. The ROI coordinates and labels are sorted in a <sup>*</sup>.csv table for output indexing purpose, while the header reference image is used to define the output image properties such as the bounding box, originator, orientation, inclusive mask, and voxel size.</p>

More atlases will be added in the future.</p>

          <title>Amplitude of time series (AM)</title>
          <p>AM is calculated as the average amplitude and the standard deviation of the mean-subtracted time series (Liu et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The AM represents the strength of time series' temporal fluctuation, which is similar to the ALFF/fALFF.

          <title>Functional connectivity density and functional connectivity strength (FCD/FCS)</title>
          <p>A region growing algorithm was carried out by Tomasi and Volkow (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) to measure the local degree of each voxel under a certain threshold of Pearson's correlation. FCD in BRANT has been implemented to calculate the local FCD (lFCD), the global FCD (gFCD), and the long-range FCD (lrFCD) at one time. The lFCD of each voxel represents the number of spatially connected voxels defined by the region growing algorithm (Tomasi and Volkow, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), while the gFCD, which is also referred to as the voxel-wise degree centrality (Craddock and Clark, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), represents the number of voxels that have higher-than-threshold correlation with the seed voxel. The lrFCD is calculated as the gFCD subtracted by the lFCD (Qin et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>
          <p>The original description of the gFCD includes whole-brain voxel-wise correlation, which is time consuming for traditional CPU implementation. In BRANT, we first calculate the gFCD in parallel with OPENCL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">https://www.khronos.org/opencl/</ext-link>), and meanwhile keep in memory the thresholded voxel-wise FC matrix in bits, and then carry on the region grow method for each voxel on multiple CPU threads for lFCD. Since the binarized correlation matrices are stored in bits, the required memory is 1 / (4bytes <sup>*</sup> 8bits/byte) of the <italic>float</italic> data type, which makes the program run smoothly on a 4GB-memory laptop with a 1GB-memory discrete GPU for preprocessed rs-fMRI 4D images with ~50,000 voxels, ~230 timepoints. The computing time can vary with the distribution of connectivity strength, that when the mean connectivity strength rises, there are more binarized connections as well as more time spent on the region grow method. In our experience, for rs-fMRI image with ~230 timepoints, ~50,000 voxels (3<sup>*</sup>3<sup>*</sup>3 mm<sup>3</sup> spatial resolution), and the program can finish within 2–5 min. By default, the definition of neighbor type is set as vertex-connected.</p>
          <p>Functional connectivity strength (FCS) measures the amount of information a node receives across whole graph or within a distance (Jiang et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; He et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Similar to FCD, the voxel-wise Pearson's correlation coefficients are firstly calculated in parallel and then Fisher-z transformed to improve normality. For each voxel, the FCS is calculated as the sum of connectivity that exceeds a given threshold divided by the number of voxels.</p>

Regarding brain networks, ROIs are defined as nodes and the connections between pairs of ROIs are defined as edges.

Then, available complex network metrics including shortest path length, clustering coefficient, small-worldness, global and local efficiency, betweenness centrality, weighted and binary degree centrality, neighbor degree centrality, assortative mixing, resilience, transitivity, fault tolerance, vulnerability are calculated.

To draw another surface, users can input a binarized 3D mask, with which BRANT can extract vertices and faces and render a new surface. When projecting a 3D volume to surface, the vertices on the surface are shaded as the intensity of the nearest voxel, while the material of the surface, the colormaps of positive and negative intensities, the lighting and shading algorithms can be adjusted.</p>

          <p>Since in practice raw MRI data exported from an MR scanner consists of a large number of DICOM images storing slices and volumes of different sequences, by convention we convert the DICOM images to packed 3D or 4D NIFTI images before all processing steps. In BRANT, we use the <italic>dcm2nii</italic> from MRIcron/MRIcro (Rorden and Brett, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) to convert DICOM files into 4D NIfTI images by default and use wildcard characters to locate rs-fMRI image files.

In preprocessing, six head motion parameters of (x-, y-, z-) translations and (pitch-, yaw-, roll-) rotations estimated during realignment are used as the inputs of the current function. By default, the current function outputs the maximum absolute translation and rotation between frames as the exclusion criterion of large-motion subject. Additionally, the mean head displacement (the root-mean-square of translation parameters), the maximum head displacement, the number of micro displacement (&gt;0.1 mm), the mean absolute Euler angle of rotation (Van Dijk et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), the framewise displacement (FD) (Power et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and the number of frames with FD &gt; 0.5 mm, are also exported to provide more subject exclusion criteria.</p>

To exclude spurious voxels, we use the thresholded voxel-wise TSNR, which is calculated as the average intensity of time series divided by the standard deviation (Tomasi and Volkow, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Yeo et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Welvaert and Rosseel, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), to generate subject-level or group-level whole-brain mask.</p>

        <title>Code-generated GUIs and embedded third-party software</title>
        <p>GUI panels of BRANT are designed as combinations of code-generated GUI elements that receive and check user inputs. For example, in <italic>ReHo</italic>, the following inputs are expected to locate preprocessed rs-fMRI images in each input directory:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The directory of each subject's preprocessed data;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wildcard characters to locate filename in each directory, such as ‘f<sup>*</sup>.nii’;</p></list-item><list-item><p>A numeric index to extract one unique string from each subject's directory. For example, the index should be 2 for ‘d:\data\subj001\fmri’, and 1 for ‘d:\data\fmri\subj001’ to parse the “subj001” for output purpose;</p></list-item><list-item><p>A checkbox indicating whether the input NIFTI files in each directory are multiple 3D files or one 4D file.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The full path of a 3D mask to restrict the calculation within the brain.</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p>Since most post-processing functions in BRANT require the above inputs, the code-generating process has been simplified as adding one line to a <italic>cell</italic> array (the variable ‘ui_structs’) in ‘brant_postprocess_defaults.m’.</p>
        <p>{'sub_gui', 'disp_dirs_nii_mask'}, 'input_nifti', {{'filetype', 'f<sup>*</sup>.nii'}, {'nm_pos', 1}},”;</p>
        <p>Items in the first <italic>cell</italic> indicate there is a combination of GUIs named 'disp_dirs_nii_mask' to be parsed in the ‘sub_gui’ <italic>dictionary</italic>. Then, two <italic>fields</italic> of “input_nifti” will be initialized with the third <italic>cell</italic> “{{'filetype', 'f<sup>*</sup>.nii'}, {'nm_pos', 1}}” to change the default wildcard characters of <italic>filetype</italic> to “f<sup>*</sup>.nii” and the default numeric index of output string to 1. For the rest of the example <italic>ReHo</italic> GUI generation, such as neighbor type, normalize options, smooth options and output directory, BRANT uses a similar procedure as above. In the end, we add the ‘process_fun = @brant_reho;’ to specify ‘brant_reho.m’ as the data processing script for the GUI parameters collected by the button labeled with ‘run’. See <italic>case</italic> ‘reho’ in the script ‘brant_postprocess_defaults.m’ for more details. When generating the <italic>ReHo</italic> panel, BRANT at first collects all above GUI parts and default settings, and then breaks each input into basic MATLAB GUI elements (e.g., pushbutton, text, checkbox, pop-up menu) and draws them on the ‘ReHo’ panel along with preset callback functions.</p>
        <p>In the following two sections, we introduce two instances of packing batch processing terminal scripts into GUI panels.</p>

          <p>Circos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://circos.ca/">http://circos.ca/</ext-link>) is a Perl-based software designed to visualize pair-wise connections on a ring map (Krzywinski et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Irimia et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Fan et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, each time users would need to prepare files for <italic>band</italic> and <italic>link</italic>, tune parameters and open a terminal to run commands. In the current function, we use the code-generated GUI to collect input parameters and pass them to a prepared Circos script. Expected input parameters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) include the directory of Circos binaries (<italic>circos dir</italic>), the directory of Circos configuration file (<italic>conf dir</italic>), a descriptive table for ROI information (<italic>roi info</italic>), a file stores the ROI-ROI connectivity matrix (<italic>edges</italic>), colors for positive and negative connectivity (<italic>positive and negative edges</italic>), the choice whether to use transparent background (<italic>transparent background</italic>), and output directory (<italic>out dir</italic>).

        <title>Input/output (I/O) optimization</title>
        <p>Though metrics in BRANT have been optimized with matrix operations, parallel computing and multithreading, the total computing time is still limited to the speed of file I/O, especially when temporal or spatial resolution of a rs-fMRI image is high. To speed up file I/O, we have written and compiled a MATLAB-C++ mixed <sup>*</sup>.mex binary with zlib (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.zlib.net/">http://www.zlib.net/</ext-link>) to directly load and save gzipped files without decompression/compression. For illustration purposes, we tested the loading time of a minimally preprocessed (Glasser et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) subset of Human Connectome Project's working memory data (100 subjects, 405 timepoints, TR 720 ms, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-releases/">https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-releases/</ext-link>) on a 7200-rpm Seagate hard drive. As a result, the average loading time of one gzipped file is two times shorter than the uncompressed one (mean ± standard deviation, gzipped: 9.7 ± 1.69 s, uncompressed: 30.18 ± 2.23 s).</p>

The saving operation is tied to the button labeled with “S” (short for “save”) on most GUI panels. Besides, the <sup>*</sup>.mat files can also be loaded by the button “L” (short for “load”), to initialize panel parameters.</p>

      <title>Compare with MATLAB-based toolboxes</title>
      <p>The functions of BRANT cover a wide range of data processing, from DICOM conversion to results visualization. Since there exist a number of MATLAB-based toolboxes, we compare BRANT with three other frequently used full-featured toolboxes, DPABI v2.3 (Yan et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), GRETNA v2.0.0 (Wang et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and CONN v17.f (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). All the four toolboxes integrated SPM's preprocessing scripts and implemented their own denoising scripts for batch preprocessing. During data preprocessing, a necessary procedure of visually checking raw data quality and normalization quality is implemented in DPABI as <italic>Quality Control</italic>, in CONN as <italic>Quality Assurance</italic> and in BRANT as <italic>Visual Check</italic>. At post-processing, both GRETNA and CONN focus on graph-based analysis and provide a variety of functional connectivity analysis methods and complex network analysis methods. DPABI provides functions of voxel-based methods (e.g. ALFF, ReHo, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity Zuo et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and functional connectivity analysis. In BRANT, functional connectivity analysis, complex network analysis and several voxel-based metrics of spontaneous activity are implemented. To test statistical hypotheses, BRANT implemented the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test for second-level analysis and the IBMA for element-wise meta-analysis, but neither the analysis of covariance in DPABI and GRETNA, nor the subject-level and group-level analysis in CONN. For results visualization, CONN provides a wide range of methods to plot voxel-wise connectivity in histogram, to overlay voxel intensity on slices and surfaces, to render ROIs in 3D clusters, and to plot connectivity in 2D circular and 3D node-edge view. In DPABI, slice viewer is provided with thresholding and atlas labeling options, and in GRETNA, bar plot, dot plot, violin plot, and shade plot are implemented. In BRANT, results visualization functions include surface mapping for voxel intensity, ROI rendering, 3D node-edge view (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and Circos 2D circular view (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Besides data processing, statistical analysis, quality control and visualization methods, CONN and DPABI have compiled standalone versions, which can run without MATLAB. Moreover, DPABI provides pipelines tuned for monkey and rat data processing. In GRETNA, Sun Grid Engine (SGE) support is available for submitting data processing jobs to a remote computer cluster. In BRANT, we have added direct <sup>*</sup>.gz support for most post-processing functions, OPENCL-based parallel computing for time consuming FCD/FCS calculation and online GUI generation for almost all functions.</p>

      <title>Examples of rs-fMRI data analysis</title>
      <p>To validate the efficacy of our toolkit, we used the same preprocessing pipelines provided by BRANT and DPABI v2.3, to compare ReHo, fALFF and FCs using a rs-fMRI dataset consists of 18 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 17 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (mAD), 18 patients with severe Alzheimer's disease (sAD) and 21 normal controls (NC). This dataset was used in our previous study (Liu et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and made available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/yongliulab">https://github.com/yongliulab</ext-link>.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Subjects, data acquisition, and processing</title>
        <p>The details of the dataset can be found in our previous studies (He et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Liu et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Therefore, in the current paper we provide a brief introduction about the subjects' inclusion and exclusion criteria, data acquisition and processing to maintain the scientific integrity of the present study. All the participants were recruited by advertisement and supported throughout the testing procedures in a specialist neuropsychological research facility at Xuanwu Hospital, Beijing, China. Patients and informants (usually a family member) were clinically interviewed by a senior neurologist. Written consent forms were obtained from all subjects or their legal guardians (usually a family member). The study was approved by the ethics committee of Xuanwu Hospital. AD subjects were diagnosed using standard operationalized criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV); American Psychiatric Association 1994 and National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke - Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA); McKhann et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). The severity of dementia was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (Morris, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Patients with a diagnosis of AD and CDR score of 1 were classified as mild AD and those with a CDR score of 2 or 3 were diagnosed as severe AD. MCI was diagnosed according to standard criteria (Petersen et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Choo et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), which included subjective memory loss with objective evidence of memory impairment in the context of normal or near-normal performance on other domains of cognitive functioning; minimal impairment of activities of daily living; and a CDR score of 0.5. Normal volunteers have a CDR score of 0. All participants satisfied the following inclusion criteria: (1) no history of an affective disorder within 1 month prior to assessment; (2) normal vision and audition; (3) able to cooperate with cognitive testing; (4) aged between 50 and 90 years; (5) no clinical history of stroke or other severe cerebrovascular disease; and (6) no more than one lacunar infarction, without patchy or diffuse leukoaraiosis, on neuroradiological assessment of conventional MR images. The exclusion criteria included: (1) severe general medical disorders of cardiovascular, endocrine, renal, or hepatic systems; neurological disorders associated with potential cognitive dysfunction, including local brain lesions, traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness or confusion, and dementia associated with neurosyphilis, Parkinsonism, or Lewy body disease; psychiatric disorders including depression, alcohol, or drug abuse; (2) concomitant use of psychotropic medication in large quantity; and (3) insufficient cognitive capacity to understand and cooperate with study procedures. All patients underwent a complete physical and neurological examination, an extensive battery of neuropsychological assessments, and standard laboratory tests. Healthy volunteers underwent a brief clinical interview and MMSE to confirm that they satisfied exclusion criteria for cognitive deficits, psychoactive drug use, and clinical disorders.</p>
        <p>The MR images were acquired on a 3.0-T MR scanner (Magnetom Trio, Siemens, Germany). Functional MRI data were acquired using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast: Repetition time (TR) = 2,000 ms, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle (FA) = 90°, matrix = 64 × 64, field of view (FOV) = 220 mm × 220 mm, slice thickness = 3 mm with inter-slice gap = 1 mm. Each brain volume comprised 32 axial slices, and each scanning session lasted for 360 s. Sagittal T1-weighted MR images were acquired by a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (TR/TE = 2000/2.6 ms, FA = 9°, matrix = 256 × 224, FOV = 256 mm × 224 mm, 176 continuous sagittal slices with 1 mm thickness).</p>
        <p>To compare the results between different toolkits, we performed the same processing pipeline in the present study. After DICOM to NIFTI conversion, the first 10 timepoints of EPI images were discarded. The following consecutive rs-fMRI timepoints were processed with the BRANT pipeline, which includes slice timing correction, within subject registration, rigid-body registration of T1 image to EPI mean image, normalization of EPI images to MNI standard space using T1 image. After normalization, EPI images were resampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>. The co-registration and spatial normalization functions integrated in BRANT, DPABI and GRETNA are slightly different. For example, prior to T1 to rs-fMRI co-registration, BRANT firstly segments the T1 image (with SPM-<italic>Segment</italic>) to tissue probability maps in individual space, and then extract the brain with gray matter probability + white matter (WM) probability + cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) probability &gt; 0.5 as mask, while DPABI uses <italic>bet</italic> with tuned parameters from FSL to extract brain, and in GRETNA, no brain extraction method was found. To compare all software with same preprocessing procedures, we used the spatially normalized results processed with BRANT and ran same denoising processes in BRANT, DPABI and GRETNA for the following calculations and comparisons. The denoising process consists of linear and quadratic trends removal, covariates regression and band-pass filtering within 0.01-0.08 Hz. Covariates include mean and squared signals of WM and CSF (extracted by same masks across different software), and the Friston's 24-parameter head motion model (Friston et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). To mask out spurious voxels in the gray matter, we used the intersection between group mean TSNR mask (intensity &gt; 30) and a gray matter mask (probability &gt;30%), to mask the following fALFF and ReHo calculation, as well as the AAL atlas used for ROI-wise FC calculation. We calculated fALFF within frequency band 0.01~0.08 Hz with the unfiltered images, while we calculated ReHo (with 27 neighboring voxels) and FCs with the preprocessed images. The ReHo and fALFF maps were normalized by z-score transform and then smoothed with a 6 × 6 × 6 mm<sup>3</sup> Gaussian kernel, while the FCs were Fisher-z transformed. We performed the <italic>t</italic>-tests, with age, education and gender regressed out as covariates, to compare the group mean differences of FCs (among BRANT, GRETNA, and DPABI), fALFF (between BRANT, and DPABI) and ReHo (between BRANT, and DPABI).</p>

      <p>No significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) of age (two-tailed two sample <italic>t</italic>-test), gender (chi-squared test) and education (two-tailed two sample <italic>t</italic>-test) were found between each patient group and NC group. T-statistic maps of fALFF, ReHo (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and results of FCs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, uncorrected) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) based on different toolkits have quite similar patterns, which suggest BRANT is another optimal toolkit for rs-fMRI research community. In the results, the minor differences can be induced by different implementations of trends removal, covariance regression and band-pass filter. For example, in trends removal and covariates regression steps, BRANT and DPABI put the temporal trends within the regression model, while in GRETNA trends removal and covariates regression are two separate processes. In band-pass filtering, BRANT periodically extends time series with mirrored ones, while DPABI and GRETNA pad time series with zeroes. For the results, we didn't draw a strong conclusion, since the interpretation requires multiple comparison corrections and is not the main point of the current study. Moreover, there exist other algorithms which can better remove the motion related signals as discussed in one recent study (Ciric et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), such as timepoints scrubbing (Power et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and component based noise correction methods (Behzadi et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Pruim et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>).</p>

      <title>Summary of the BRANT</title>
      <p>We presented the construction and the key features of BRANT in the manuscript and put online the updated instructions and implementation details (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brant.brainnetome.org">http://brant.brainnetome.org</ext-link> for instructions and stable BRANT versions), to keep the toolbox updated and compatible to newer SPM and MATLAB versions.</p>
      <p>Among the above rs-fMRI data processing toolboxes, our package has two distinguishing advantages. One is, other than focusing on several specific types of rs-fMRI data processing, functions of BRANT cover a wide range of rs-fMRI data processing methods. The other advantage lies in the implementation process that GUIs are created automatically with a few lines of MATLAB code instead of drawn manually. On the other side, BRANT also has some limitations in several modules. For example, in denoising pipeline, we have added regression models composed of tissue mean signals, and head motion estimates in the regression model, but not the independent component analysis (ICA) based methods such as the ICA-AROMA method (Pruim et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>), which was found better at removing distance-dependent motion artifacts (Ciric et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In statistical analysis, we have implemented Student's <italic>t</italic>-tests for group mean comparisons, but the first-level analysis for activation detection, and the analysis of variance for multi-group variances inference are yet not implemented and will be added in the future. In network analysis, a number of thresholds and random networks are induced and the computation is very intense even running with parallel workers on single machine. To reduce the computing time, the pipeline system for Octave and Matlab (PSOM) (Bellec et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) can be used to submit the jobs in parallel to a computer cluster.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have developed a GUI-based MATLAB toolbox, which consists of modules for preprocessing, voxel-based spontaneous activity analysis, functional connectivity analysis, complex network analysis, statistical analysis, and results visualization. In the toolbox, scripts are optimized by efficient file handling methods and parallel computing, while functions are made easily extendable by code-generated GUIs. Along with the contributions from open source community, we seek to provide more robust and versatile versions in the future.</p>
