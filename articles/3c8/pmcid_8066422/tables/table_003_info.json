Means (m) and standard deviations (SD), or sample size and percent are presented below. WS criteria: Healthy weight at baseline and follow up and below the 70th BMI percentile, and a change in BMI z-score SD of < 0.2. WG criteria: a change in body mass index (BMI) z-score SD > 0.2 + 20 pounds weight gain at follow up. BMI z-score and percentiles were calculated using the CDC standards for age-sex-weight-height-specific cut offs (Kuczmarski et al., 2000).
