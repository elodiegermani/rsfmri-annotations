The AUC as well as the number of children in the analysis and features included are displayed for the training and testing dataset for children included in the Y1 structural prediction analysis. Of note, covariates were dummy coded for race, sex, handedness, and MRI scanner serial number. The brain features included cortical thickness, surface area, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) estimates of fractional anisotrophy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), and subcortical volume regions. The beta weight for each brain feature is listed in Table 9. WG = weight gain; WS = weight stable; AUC = area under the curve.", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_009.csv"}
