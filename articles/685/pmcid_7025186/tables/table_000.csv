Data format,"Raw, Analyzed"
Experimental factors,"Resting-state functional connectivity-based features from healthy controls and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from autism brain imaging data exchange (ABIDE), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from ADHD-200 and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and post-concussion syndrome (PCS) acquired in-house."
Experimental features,Resting-state: participants were requested to have their eyes open and were asked to not think of anything specific. Functional connectivity features calculated from resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Rs-fMRI) volumes. The data was further divided into two samples for training and testing. Various splits were performed resulting in both homogeneous and heterogeneous samples.
