"Value of the Data•Our data can be used for replication, benchmarking and testing the performance of various machine learning algorithms to classify neurological diseases.•These datasets would provide machine learning enthusiasts, who are not from the field of neuroimaging, an opportunity to explore disease classification without any prior knowledge or experience in either neuroscience or neuroimaging. However, researchers from outside the field of neuroimaging must familiarize themselves with the nuances, caveats, and limitations of the application of machine learning to questions of clinical diagnosis using neuroimaging-derived features before using these methods [???, ???, ???].•The MALINI toolbox provides a one-stop solution for extracting the BOLD time series from regions in the CC200 template [???] and other brain parcellation templates, calculation of connectivity-based features from pre-processed fMRI data, and disease classification from the extracted features.•The toolbox we include has 18 different machine learning algorithms embedded within it which can be used for disease classification. Further, consensus classification, by combining inferences from multiple classifiers, is also available. The code in the toolbox can be modified to include other machine learning classifiers as well."
