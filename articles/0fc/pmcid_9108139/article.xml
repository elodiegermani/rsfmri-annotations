          <title>Background</title>
          <p id="Par1">Disruption of brain functional connectivity has been detected after stroke, but whether it also occurs in moyamoya disease (MMD) is unknown. Impaired functional connectivity is always correlated with abnormal white matter fibers. Herein, we used multimodal imaging techniques to explore the changes in brain functional and structural connectivity in MMD patients.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p id="Par2">We collected structural images, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging for each subject. Cognitive functions of MMD patients were evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Trail Making Test parts A and B (TMT-A/-B). We calculated the functional connectivity for every paired region using 90 regions of interest from the Anatomical Automatic Labeling Atlas and then determined the differences between MMD patients and HCs. We extracted the functional connectivity of paired brain regions with significant differences between the two groups. Correlation analyses were then performed between the functional connectivity and variable cognitive functions. To explore whether the impaired functional connectivity and cognitive performances were attributed to the destruction of white matter fibers, we further analyzed fiber integrity using tractography between paired regions that were correlated with cognition.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p id="Par3">There was lower functional connectivity in MMD patients as compared to HCs between the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, between the bilateral supramarginal gyrus, between the left supplementary motor area (SMA) and the left orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFGorb), and between the left SMA and the left middle temporal gyrus (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, FDR corrected). The decreased functional connectivity between the left SMA and the left IFGorb was significantly correlated with the MMSE (<italic>r</italic> = 0.52, <italic>P</italic> = 0.024), MoCA (<italic>r</italic> = 0.60, <italic>P</italic> = 0.006), and TMT-B (<italic>r</italic> = -0.54, <italic>P</italic> = 0.048) in MMD patients. White matter fibers were also injured between the SMA and IFGorb in the left hemisphere and were positively correlated with reduced functional connectivity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p id="Par4">Brain functional and structural connectivity between the supplementary motor area and inferior frontal gyrus in the left hemisphere are damaged in MMD. These findings could be useful in the evaluation of disease progression and prognosis of MMD.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p id="Par21">Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic cerebrovascular occlusion disease, of which the underlying pathogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Chronic hypoperfusion in patients with MMD will inevitably damage white matter fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The low perfusion or microstructurally altered tissue may appear normal on conventional magnetic resonance images, and are called normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Aberrant neural functioning develops because of damage to white matter fibers or the neural pathway, which is linked to worse cognitive outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par22">Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used to study brain functional organization in patients with stroke and neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal correlation that equals a Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>, in the high amplitude, low-frequency spontaneously generated blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal between voxels or brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Exploring the characteristics of brain functional connectivity changes is beneficial because it can promote our knowledge regarding cognitive impairment secondary to chronic ischemia in MMD and is crucial for predicting the reversibility of neurocognitive dysfunctions after revascularization surgery. Thus, functional connectivity changes may become early features of cognitive impairment and a prognostic hallmark of MMD. Some researchers even suggest that rs-fMRI should be performed as part of routine clinical investigations that enable assessment of multiple brain systems in MMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par23">Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to quantify microstructural alterations in white matter in vivo, and is especially useful for patients with neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The main mechanism of DTI involves measuring the magnitude and directionality of random water movement to generate information regarding tissue or fiber integrity of the direct connections between different brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are the primary tensor metrics that reflect the overall physiological and pathological alterations of white matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD), which reflect axon integrity and myelin sheath integrity, respectively, can be useful for understanding the underlying physiology in many aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It has been confirmed that these DTI metrics are correlated to cognitive performances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par24">However, it remains unclear whether rs-fMRI can elucidate distinct brain functional characteristics using region-based analyses and whether the abnormal functional connectivity is related to altered cognition or white matter integrity in MMD. In the current study, we used rs-fMRI to explore the changes in brain functional connectivity in MMD patients on a large-scale level. Furthermore, DTI was used to study the subtle microstructural alterations of white matter fibers and their relationship to impaired brain functions in MMD patients. Our results could be applied as the hallmark in the evaluation of disease progression and prognosis of MMD.</p>

      <sec id="Sec3">
        <title>Participants</title>
        <p id="Par25">The current study included 22 MMD patients and 10 healthy controls (HC). Patients were diagnosed with MMD based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Patients were right-handed and exhibited ischemia or hemorrhage with a time to onset of more than 3 months. The exclusion criteria were as follows: incomplete MRI data, revascularization surgery before the study, or cortical lesions on T1-weighted images (T1WI) larger than 3 mm. All imaging data were reviewed by two experienced clinicians (Dr. Xu and Dr. Wang). Patients were assessed for cognitive function by the same psychiatrist (Dr. Zheng) before the MRI scan. The cognitive assessment package included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Trail Making Test parts A and B (TMT-A/-B). The total times (in seconds) for the TMT-A and TMT-B were used to represent the direct scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par26">In addition, another 10 healthy participants that were gender-, age-, and education-matched with the MMD group were recruited as the control group. There were no brain lesions and no history of neurologic or systemic diseases in the participants in the control group. Our study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University (ID: 2020–064), and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p>

        <title>MR imaging acquisition</title>
        <p id="Par27">The acquisition of study data was completed on a 3T MR scanner (Discovery MR750, GE) with an 8-channel head coil. The protocol included obtaining three-dimensional (3D) T1WI, rs-fMRI, and DTI. Spongy padding and earplugs were used by patients to decrease noise and head motion.</p>
        <p id="Par28">T1WIs were collected through 3D fast spoiled gradient-echo (3D-FSPGR): repetition time (TR) = 7.4 ms, echo time (TE) = 3.1 ms, flip angle = 8°, field of view (FOV) = 256 × 256 mm, slices = 170, and voxel size = 0.8 × 0.8 × 1.0 mm<sup>3</sup>. T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were acquired with following parameters: TR = 8,400 ms, TE = 145.3 ms, flip angle = 90°, FOV = 512 × 512 mm, slices = 40, and voxel size = 0.39 × 0.39 × 4.0 mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par29">The diffusion-weighted images were acquired using 60 motion-probing gradient directions with <italic>b</italic>-values of 2,000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> and two repetitions on <italic>b</italic> = 0 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, TR = 9,000 ms, TE = 92.7 ms, flip angle = 90°, FOV = 256 × 256 mm, slices = 68, and voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 2.0 mm<sup>3</sup>. To correct the image distortion, we also obtained reverse phase-coded images.</p>
        <p id="Par30">The rs-fMRI was performed using a gradient echo planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2,002 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 77°, FOV = 64 × 64 mm, slices = 38, voxel size = 3.44 × 3.44 × 4.0 mm<sup>3</sup>, and 180 continuous functional volumes were axially acquired.</p>

          <p id="Par31">The functional images were preprocessed and analyzed using CONN toolbox v.20.b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] based on Matlab (v.R2020b, MathWorks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA). The first ten images were removed to avoid unstable magnetic artifacts. Then performing slice-timing correction to align rs-fMRI images to the center of the image. The remaining images were spatially realigned to the first image for head-motion correction. The mean realigned functional image was normalized to the EPI template in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space with a voxel size of 3 × 3 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup> voxels. The data were smoothed with an 8-mm full width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. We followed the default CONN denoising step that using a combination of aCompCor strategy (including white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signal, 5 components each), motion regression (12 regressors: 3 translation and 3 rotation + 6 first-order temporal derivatives), and scrubbing (74 noise components were identified) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Then, the temporal signals in the 4-dimensional volume were linearly detrended and band-pass filtered (0.008–0.09 Hz) to remove undesired components.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par42">Studying the functional organization of the brain in stroke and neurodegenerative diseases has sparked the interest of many researchers in recent years. Although there have been several studies applying functional MRI techniques in the realm of MMD to explore ‘small-world’ network topologies, dynamic functional connectivity networks, and modularity in MMD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the current study performed ROI-based analyses via functional connectivity for the first time and further combined tensor metrics to provide additional evidence for our findings.</p>
      <p id="Par43">There is growing evidence that brain functional changes may occur prior to the structural changes and imply a dissociation between functional impairment and structural damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. While the BOLD signal contrast depends on the interplay among hemodynamic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], this may explain the physiology underlying reduced interhemispheric or intrahemispheric functional connectivity after stroke; thus, changes in brain function are likely to be more sensitive than that in structural pathways.</p>
      <p id="Par44">Our study showed that the functional connectivity of several paired regions decreased in MMD patients. There is increasing evidence that intrahemispheric or interhemispheric connectivity changes that occur in ischemic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] are linked to cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Here, we also confirmed that changes in functional connectivity were correlated with cognitive performances in MMD, although significant correlation was only demonstrated in the functional connectivity between SMA-IFGorb in left hemisphere. The functional pathway of the left SMA-IFGorb had a significant positive correlation with the MMSE and MoCA, and a negative correlation with the TMT-B. Since the larger TMT-B scores indicate worse performance, it means that this pathway is positively correlated with general cognitive function and processing speed or set-shifting abilities.</p>
      <p id="Par45">The SMA complex is located in the posterior part of the superior frontal gyrus, which is bounded by the cingulate gyrus, anterior central gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Neuroimaging studies have confirmed that the SMA is involved in the cognitive process of working memory, executive control and processing speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Through fiber tracking imaging, researchers found that the most important subcortical connection with the SMA included the primary motor area, the cingulate, the corpus callosum, the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and the striatal complex-internal capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is important to mention that the frontal aslant tract has been identified as a white matter tract connecting the SMA to the IFG, and it was shown to have a role in language function, working memory, social community tasks, attention, and processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our results were consistent with the abovementioned anatomical and imaging studies of the SMA.</p>
      <p id="Par46">MMD is an ischemic disease that affects patients for a long period of time, and chronic insufficient blood supply leads to demyelination of white matter fibers and destruction of axon integrity. However, such patterns of subtle damage referred to as NAWM are usually not demonstrated in the structural images; thus, preventing us from detecting the brain abnormalities that are caused by MMD on conventional MRI sequences. Here, in this study, we excluded patients with cerebral lesions larger than 3 mm. In ischemic MMD with symptoms including TIA, dizziness, or headache, there is always no apparent cerebral lesion. In hemorrhagic MMD, cerebral lesions could be the residual minor destruction of brain structures after the absorption of hematoma. And especially in patients with primary IVH, there is always no evidence of lesions in the parenchyma. Fortunately, with the development of MR technology, we can use emerging methods to elucidate brain damage by capitalizing on many different aspects other than structure.</p>
      <p id="Par47">Currently, there is intense research being conducted on white matter integrity and brain functional connectivity in neurological diseases. Studies have shown that white matter abnormalities are correlated with disrupted functional connectivity, suggesting that common mechanisms may underlie fibers and functional connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our study revealed that the fiber integrity and functional connectivity between the SMA and the IFGorb in the left hemisphere were disrupted before the development of a significant brain lesion in MMD patients. Such early detection of brain abnormalities at the preclinical stage is conducive for implementing preventive interventions to abate cognitive decline in MMD.</p>
      <p id="Par48">FA, MD, RD, and AD are the main tensor metrics that are derived from DTI. When the white matter fibers are damaged, the diffusion range of water molecules in the fibers increase, and the values of FA, MD, and RD will also increase accordingly. Our study showed that the FA of the fibers between the SMA and the IFGorb were not significantly different between MMD patients and HCs. This might be the result of the existence of cross fibers between the two brain regions, or it is highly likely that it occurred because the disruption of the fibers happened in all directions.</p>
      <p id="Par49">The interpretations of the changes in the AD are controversial. Theoretically, the AD values decrease when axons are injured, but other studies report that the AD increases in damaged white matter regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The potential mechanism consists of increased extracellular water content that is secondary to atrophy of white matter fibers, and alterations in the water flow in the axons occur due to the breakdown of certain components of the cytoskeleton, which allows water molecules to move more rapidly parallel to the axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. To summarize, in the case of intensive axonal loss, the increased isotropic diffusion is likely to enhance both RD and AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par50">Though it seems a bit of redundancy across the cognitive assessment package that we used, there still lies some differences between MMSE, MoCA, and TMT. For example, the MMSE is likely a better test for more severe cognitive impairment and MoCA for mild conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. TMT is also different from the block that is included in MoCA. Research suggested that TMT had a better performance than MoCA in some cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. On the other hand, the TMT is a more precise indicator of reduced visual processing speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. While they have different applications and results, combining these measurements may provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive impairment and recovery after revascularization surgery in MMD patients.</p>
      <p id="Par51">CONN is a Matlab-based software that has been widely used for the calculation, demonstration, and investigation of brain network connectivity. Connectivity assessment techniques include seed-to-voxel network maps, ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrixes, graph characteristics of network systems, brain interconnection, inherent connectivity, generalized psychophysiological interaction models, and other voxel-to-voxel measures. Unlike seed-based correlation analysis, which is a hypothesis-driven approach based on a chosen region, ROI-to-ROI analysis is a data-driven method that can produce information regarding the entire brain connectivity pattern. Therefore, we used ROI-based analyses in this study, which we considered to be more powerful for investigating the abnormal brain functional connectivity at the regional level.</p>
      <p id="Par52">White matter integrity impairment and cognitive disruption in MMD have been demonstrated in several studies, aberrant functional connectivity is another form of brain damage caused by MMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The impaired brain functional and structural connectivity between the SMA and IFG in the left hemisphere provides us a novel perception of the pathophysiology of MMD and might be applied as the hallmark in the evaluation of disease progression and prognosis of MMD in the future.</p>
      <p id="Par53">There are some limitations to our study that must be mentioned. First, like other MMD imaging studies, a small number of patients were investigated due to the rare incidence of the disease, which limits the generalizability of our results. It is necessary to conduct a multi-center, large-sample study to confirm our results. Due to the impact of COVID-19, the collection of control cases has also been affected, though a matched study is more appropriate. Second, vascular abnormalities of MMD mainly involve the anterior circulation of the brain, and therefore, our study did not include the cerebellum as a ROI. It is worth noting that some studies indicate the existence of a functional connection between the cerebellum and the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Third, anatomical and imaging studies have shown rich fiber connections between the SMA and the IFG that are associated with cognitive functioning, whereas our results show only that the breakdown of the connection between the SMA and the IFGorb in the left hemisphere is significantly correlated with the cognitive performance of MMD patients. Fourth, further studies are required to determine whether functional or structural connectivity is initially damaged before the onset of cognitive dysfunction in patients with MMD.</p>
