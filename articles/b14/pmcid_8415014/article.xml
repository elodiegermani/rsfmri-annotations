        <p id="P3">The functionality of central vision is different from peripheral vision. Central vision is used for fixation and has higher acuity, making it useful for everyday activities such as reading and object identification. The central and peripheral representations in primary visual cortex (V1) also differ in how higher-order processing areas modulate their responses. For example, attention and expectation are top-down processes (i.e., high-order cognitive functions) that influence visual information processing during behavioral tasks. This top-down control is different for central vs. peripheral vision. Since functional networks can influence visual information processing in different ways, networks (such as the Fronto-Parietal (FPN), Default Mode (DMN), and Cingulo-Opercular (CON)) likely differ in how they connect to representations of the visual field across V1. Prior work indicated the central representing portion of V1 was more functionally connected to regions belonging to the FPN, and the far-peripheral representing portion of V1 was more functionally connected to regions belonging to the DMN.</p>
        <p id="P4">Our goals were (1) Assess the reproducibility and generalizability of retinotopic effects on functional connections between V1 and functional networks. (2) Extend this work to understand structural connections of central vs. peripheral representations in V1. (3) Examine the overlapping eccentricity differences in functional and structural connections of V1. (4) Examine the major white matter tracks connecting central V1 to frontal regions.</p>
        <p id="P5">We used resting-state BOLD fMRI and DWI to examine whether portions of V1 that represent different visual eccentricities differ in their functional and structural connectivity to functional networks. All data were acquired and minimally preprocessed by the Human Connectome Project. We identified central and far-peripheral representing regions from a retinotopic template. Functional connectivity was measured by correlated activity between V1 and functional networks, and structural connectivity was measured by probabilistic tractography and converted to track probability. In both modalities, differences between V1 eccentricity segment connections were compared by paired, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test. A spatial permutation approach was used to determine the statistical significance of the spatial overlap between modalities. The identified spatial overlap was then used in a deterministic tractography approach to identify the white matter pathways connecting the overlap to central V1.</p>
        <p id="P6">We found (1) Centrally representing portions of V1 are more strongly functionally connected to frontal regions than are peripherally representing portions of V1, (2) Structural connections also show stronger connections between central V1 and frontal regions, (3) Patterns of structural and functional connections overlaps in the lateral frontal cortex, (4) This lateral frontal overlap is connected to central V1 via the IFOF.</p>
        <p id="P7">In summary, the work’s main contribution is a greater understanding of higher-order functional networks’ connectivity to V1. There are stronger structural connections to central representations in V1, particularly for lateral frontal regions, implying that the functional relationship between central V1 and frontal regions is built upon direct, long-distance connections via the IFOF. Overlapping structural and functional connections reflect differences in V1 eccentricities, with central V1 preferentially connected to attention-associated regions. Understanding how V1 is functionally and structurally connected to higher-order brain areas contributes to our understanding of how the human brain processes visual information and forms a baseline for understanding any modifications in processing that might occur with training or experience.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P8">The function of central vision is different from peripheral vision. Central vision is used for fixation and has higher acuity, making it useful for reading and object identification (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Larson and Loschky, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Pelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">Trouilloud et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R110" ref-type="bibr">Yoo and Chong, 2012</xref>). Peripheral vision has lower acuity but is essential for visual tasks such as visual search and getting the gist of a scene (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Larson and Loschky, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Rosenholtz, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">Trouilloud et al., 2020</xref>). Differences in acuity between peripheral and central vision alone do not provide a full explanation of the extent of disparity in visual ability (<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Levi et al., 1985</xref>; Levi et al., 1984). Information processing of central and peripheral visual information also differs. Peripheral visual information is processed faster than central information (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2002</xref>), and this fast processing helps determine objects’ salience within the visual field. This enables the visual system to direct saccades, fast eye movements, to a salient location (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2002</xref>). When central vision orients to the salient location, it provides high acuity information and distinguishes it from competing, distracting information (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P9">The human primary visual cortex (V1) is organized along the calcarine sulcus in a progression of posterior representations of central vision (central V1) to anterior representations of peripheral vision (far-peripheral V1) (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Duncan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Engel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 1987</xref>). The anatomical regions representing central and peripheral V1 differ in their cortical thickness (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Burge et al., 2016</xref>). The central representing portion of V1– the part of the visual field used for fixation – has a thicker cortex compared to the peripheral representing cortex in individuals with healthy vision (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Burge et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P10">There has been extensive prior research into the physiological differences between central and peripheral V1. Encoding of visual information differs within V1 representations of central and peripheral visual fields. The area of V1 devoted to central vision is much larger than that devoted to processing information from the peripheral visual field (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Azzopardi and Cowey, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Horton and Hoyt, 1991</xref>). In other words, the cortical magnification factor (square-mm of cortex devoted to each square-degree of visual angle) is greater for central vision than peripheral vision. Receptive field size is greater for neurons in peripheral V1 than in central V1 (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Hubel and Wiesel, 1974</xref>). As eccentricity (distance from the center) increases, cortical magnification decreases, and receptive field size increases across human V1 and nearby visual areas (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Harvey and Dumoulin, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P11">Central and peripheral V1 also differ in how higher-order processing areas modulate their responses. Functional properties of cortical neurons are adaptive; top-down demands of high-order cognitive processing tasks influence their response (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert and Li, 2013</xref>). For example, attention and expectation are top-down processes (i.e., high-order cognitive functions) that influence visual information processing during behavioral tasks (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Somers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">Tootell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R109" ref-type="bibr">Yeshurun and Carrasco, 1998</xref>). This top-down control is different for central vs. peripheral vision. Attention influences the spatial summation of receptive fields so that spatial summation in foveal cells decreases and spatial summation in the peripheral cells in V1 increases (<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>). Psychophysiological data demonstrates that top-down influences on central vision stimuli are more potent than peripheral vision stimuli (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Treisman, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R113" ref-type="bibr">Zhaoping, 2017</xref>). Similarly, attentional suppression of distractors is greater for central vision than peripheral vision (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Treisman, 2008</xref>). Vision representations are known to interact strongly with higher-order brain networks (eg. (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Casarsa De Azevedo, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Furl, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Gazzaley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Mantini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">McMains and Kastner, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R109" ref-type="bibr">Yeshurun and Carrasco, 1998</xref>), and these interactions appear to be distinct for central and peripheral vision.</p>
      <p id="P12">Resting-state functional networks are groups of brain regions whose activity is temporally correlated at rest (<xref rid="R111" ref-type="bibr">Zalesky et al., 2014</xref>). One way to identify a functional network is through clusters of correlated activity in the cortex (<xref rid="R108" ref-type="bibr">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>). The fronto-parietal network (FPN) is important for directing attentional control (<xref rid="R112" ref-type="bibr">Zanto and Gazzaley, 2013</xref>), the cingulo-opercular network (CON) is involved in the maintenance of task demands (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Coste and Kleinschmidt, 2016</xref>), and the default mode network (DMN) is less active when there are attentional or task goals (<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Raichle, 2015</xref>) and instead is thought to support tasks such as memory retrieval and semantic processing (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Binder, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Sestieri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">Spreng, 2012</xref>). Since functional networks can influence visual information processing in different ways, networks likely differ in how they connect to representations of the visual field across V1. There are also feedforward connections between V1 and functional network regions, as evidenced by the fact that strong stimulus-driven signals are observed in higher-order brain regions (<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Katsuki and Constantinidis, 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P13">Previous work in our lab has investigated how the central-to-peripheral cortical organization of V1 influences functional connectivity between V1 and the rest of the cortex (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al., 2017</xref>). This prior work showed retinotopic patterns of functional connectivity between V1 and functional networks during resting fixation. Specifically, the central representing portion of V1 was more functionally connected to regions belonging to the FPN, and the far-peripheral representing portion of V1 was more functionally connected to regions belonging to the DMN. The fact that, as described above, central vision is under different top-down control than peripheral vision might underlie its preferential connection to the FPN, which is related to directing attentional control and has been shown to facilitate bottom-up and top-down attentional processes for visual information (<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Katsuki and Constantinidis, 2014</xref>). The role of far-peripheral vision in environmental monitoring and the need to suppress visual information from this portion of the visual field during central fixation might be the reason for preferential connectivity to the task-negative DMN (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2002</xref>). However, this previous work was limited by small sample size (i.e., 20 participants) and design (i.e., data were acquired during the resting fixation blocks of a visual task) issues (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al., 2017</xref>). These limitations leave questions regarding whether previous functional findings extend to free viewing during rest in a larger sample and, critically, how these effects relate to differences in the anatomical (i.e., white matter) connections of central vs. peripheral V1. The observed functional connections could arise from direct connections between two areas or and alternatively from weighted multi-synaptic connections (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Honey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P14">While brain anatomy is relatively fixed in adulthood, a healthy brain adapts with changes in structural connections with experience and age (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2009</xref>). White matter tracts correspond to direct connections between brain regions (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Jbabdi and Johansen-Berg, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Maier-Hein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>). Structural connections can be studied in-vivo in humans with diffusion-weighted MRI and tractography. Major white matter tracts that connect to the occipital lobe, such as the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (connects occipital lobe to the lateral prefrontal cortex) and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (connects occipital lobe to anterior temporal lobe), have been well documented using tractography methods in humans (<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R103" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P15">Traditional tracer studies that examine anatomical connections with retrograde and anterograde tracers have primarily been focused on visual areas and have not been expanded to investigate connectivity between visual areas and higher-order processing areas (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Lysakowski et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Neal et al., 1990</xref>). Extensive work by Markov and colleagues indicated some evidence of connection from V1 to regions of the frontal and parietal cortex, including F5 (a frontal area involved in motor planning), 8l (frontal eye fields), and 7A (a parietal area involved in attention modulation and planning) and connection to V1 from area 8l (frontal eye fields) (<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Markov et al., 2014</xref>). However, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus has not been found in the macaque brain, which may explain why tracer studies investigating V1 have not helped inform human occipital-prefrontal cortex connections (<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P16">The current study’s goals are (1) to assess the reproducibility and generalizability of retinotopic effects on functional connections between V1 and functional networks found in prior work (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al., 2017</xref>). We aim to extend these findings in a new dataset collected under different task conditions (previous work used blocks of rest during a task with central fixation, and the current data was collected as part of a resting-state only scan). (2) Extend prior work on the retinotopic connectivity difference to structural connections between V1 and functional networks. (3) Examine regions of overlap between functional and structural connections. Since functional connectivity between two brain regions could reflect measurable structural connections, we used DWI to examine connections between regions (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Adachi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Honey et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P17">To address these goals, we used resting-state BOLD fMRI and DWI to examine if portions of V1 that represent different visual eccentricities differ in their functional and structural connectivity to functional networks. We found (1) substantial evidence that centrally representing portions of V1 are more strongly functionally connected to lateral frontal regions than are peripherally representing portions of V1, (2) Structural connections show the same pattern, with stronger connections between central V1 and frontal regions, in particular a lateral frontal portion of the FPN, and (3) the pattern of structural and functional connections is similar, suggesting that this lateral frontal functional connection pattern arises from a direct (uni-synaptic) structural connection. These results, coupled with relationships to prior work described in the discussion, are suggestive that the processing of central vision is mediated in part through direct connections to the lateral frontal cortex.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p id="P18">The study used diffusion-weighted imaging, resting-state functional imaging, and structural imaging data from the 900-subject release of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Participants in this dataset were healthy young adults between 22and 36 years of age who had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Most subjects had at least one relative in the group; many of them are twins. Our hypotheses are not about individual differences, and due to the large sample size of the data, there is still a great deal of diversity in the sample; therefore, we did not treat related and unrelated samples separately. Using this relatively large sample size facilitates replication and extension of findings.</p>
        <p id="P19">We excluded participants with structural abnormalities (e.g., tumors and extensive area brain damage) identified through HCP quality control. We then visually inspected the remaining data for white matter abnormalities. We excluded participants if their structural scans displayed large or punctate white matter hyperintensities easily detected by eye. In total, we excluded 114 subjects from the original 900 subject dataset. Seven hundred eighty-six healthy subjects passed quality control standards, including 335 males and 449 females (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; see participant IDs in code repository). We excluded the fMRI data from four of them due to quality standards for functional comparison. Otherwise, we used the same participants in both structural and functional connectivity analyses.</p>

High-resolution three-dimensional MPRAGE, T1-weighted anatomical images (TR = 2400 ms, TE = 2.14 ms, flip angle = 8, FOV = 320 × 320 mm<sup>2</sup> , voxel size 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.7 mm<sup>3</sup> , number of slices = 256, acceleration factor (GRAPPA) = 2) were used.</p>

Thus, we used these network regions as seeds in probabilistic tractography performed by FMRIB’s Diffusion Toolbox (FDT) (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez-Fernandez et al., 2019</xref>) and used the V1 ROIs as targets. For each seed voxel, we calculated 10,000 streamlines (along with default settings of maximum steps: 2000, step length: 0.5 mm, curvature threshold: 0.2) and separate samples of the voxelwise diffusion distribution. A distance correction and loop-check, which prevents circular pathways, were applied. The tractography then resulted in each voxel within the seed ROI containing the number of streamlines that reached the target (V1 region) from that voxel. We performed tracking in individual diffusion space. We transformed seed and target regions into diffusion space for tractography analysis, and then we transformed tractography results into individual anatomical Freesurfer space for visualization. Surface maps of the track termination probabilities were smoothed using a 2 mm FWHM Gaussian filter and averaged across all subjects.</p>

      <p id="P45">Our goal was to better understand the brain network basis for interactions between sensory and higher-order information, especially how this differs between central vs. peripheral vision. Understanding the structural and functional underpinnings of these interactions is essential for understanding the processing differences between central and peripheral vision and for future work examining the plasticity of these systems.</p>
      <p id="P46">Our approach compared structural and functional connections among different retinotopic eccentricities within V1 and large-scale functional networks (Fronto-Parietal Network (FPN), Cingulo-Opercular Network (CON), Default Mode Network (DMN)). Our results indicated that different visual eccentricities have different connectivity patterns to the rest of the brain, consistent with our previous data (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al., 2017</xref>) and data from other analyses (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Buckner and Yeo, 2014</xref>). The present functional connectivity analyses replicated and extended previous findings on patterns of preferential connections between the central V1 eccentricity segment and the FPN (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al., 2017</xref>). Our structural connectivity analyses furthered the field’s understanding of the relationship between V1 and functional networks by describing the retinotopic pattern of structural connections. A comparison between structure and function showed moderate agreement, indicating that some direct structural connections likely mediate the functional connections. Further, the overlap of structural and functional findings (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) indicated the lateral frontal portions of the FPN and other nearby regions also responsible for attention and control (Inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)) made up more of the overlapping regions than the CON or DMN. This lateral frontal portion of the FPN is connected to central V1 via the IFOF (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P47">The present study found differences between the connection patterns of central and peripheral representations in V1. Since central and peripheral representations are still part of the same V1 cortical area, we would expect similarities in their connectivity patterns. Our results indicate that eccentricity differences in connection strength exist and are consistent with previously reported differences in information processing central and peripheral visual information. Central vision appears to be under more substantial top-down attentional control than peripheral vision (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Treisman, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R113" ref-type="bibr">Zhaoping, 2017</xref>). For example, stimuli presented within the peripheral visual field are more challenging to ignore than stimuli presented within the central visual field (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Treisman, 2008</xref>). The current work suggests that this distinction may come from anatomical relationships to attentional networks.</p>

On the other hand, the mid- peripheral and far-peripheral regions seemed to be preferentially connected more broadly across the cortex, with the specific exclusion of the FPN regions. The data provide further evidence to support the hypothesis of eccentricity-dependent preferential connectivity of V1 to higher-order brain networks. One contribution in describing this connectivity is to extend previous work by <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al., 2017</xref>, into a much larger dataset that was collected without fixation at rest, thereby improving the generalizability of the findings.</p>
        <p id="P49">The patterns of connectivity for the mid- and far- peripheral regions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) were similar to each other and both differed from central V1 connectivity. This result suggests that the strongest retinotopic differences in V1 connectivity are rooted in the distinction between foveal and peripheral eccentricities. Using slightly different methods (an analysis of variance across all V1 ROIs, smaller V1 ROIs, fewer participants, resting during a fixation task) <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al. (2017)</xref> obtained a similar result, but also observed modestly sized differences between mid and far peripheral V1 which we do not observe here. Further work is needed to identify what factors might lead to this difference.</p>

        <title>Structural connectivity</title>
        <p id="P50">Finding preferential structural connections between frontal regions to central V1 is consistent with our functional connectivity findings. These results support our hypothesis, based on functional connectivity findings, that the connections between V1 and brain regions associated with attentional control depend on eccentricity. As previously discussed, <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Markov et al. (2014)</xref> investigated direct structural connections in the macaque brain and found weak long-range connections between V1 and regions that may correspond to the human FPN. These connections were projections <italic>from</italic> V1 to frontal and parietal regions (areas F5, 81, and 7A) rather than projecting <italic>to</italic> V1. These results could indicate that the structural connections observed here are bottom-up connections that provide visual information to direct cognitive control within the FPN. However, previous work in macaques has not found major white matter tracts connecting the occipital lobe to the frontal lobe (<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>). Further, the attention system of the macaque is different from that in humans (<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the prior macaque literature provides limited insight into the structural connections between V1 and FPN in humans, so the direction of these connections is still unclear. Although diffusion tractography methods can conflate crossing fibers, tractography showed strikingly similar effects to our functional connectivity results, bolstering the plausibility of an interpretation of a direct connection between lateral frontal regions to V1. Describing this connectivity extends the knowledge of functional connectivity between V1 and functional networks and improves our understanding of the structural underpinnings of these functional connections.</p>

        <title>Overlap between structural and functional connections and their relationship to functional networks</title>
        <p id="P51">Structural connectivity patterns and functional connectivity patterns showed correspondence. Because diffusion tractography is typically interpreted as a direct structural connection, the functional connections between regions that also showed a structural connection likely reflect (at least in part) direct structural connections. These regions that showed centrally-weighted structural and functional connections are shown in <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> and include the inferior frontal gyrus.</p>
        <p id="P52">A direct, long-range connection between IFG and central vision representations in V1 may be related to the importance of speed in attentional control. For example, visual information needs to be processed quickly to impact attention selection. Thus, attentional control from the FPN to central vision representations in V1 would be improved by direct structural connections. Direct structural connections would also improve the processing of central vision information in FPN circuits. A large body of work supports top-down and bottom-up effects on visual processing (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Somers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">Tootell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R109" ref-type="bibr">Yeshurun and Carrasco, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R113" ref-type="bibr">Zhaoping, 2017</xref>). The present study contributes to this field by demonstrating the eccentricity-dependent nature of the relationship between V1 and higher-order brain regions and the major white matter pathway, IFOF, that connects these regions.</p>

        <title>Relationship between central vision processing and attention</title>
        <p id="P53">Complex biological systems are often driven by separate control mechanisms with distinct functional properties (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Dosenbach et al., 2008</xref>). During cognitive operations, information processing appears to rely on brain areas’ dynamic interaction as large-scale neural networks including FPN, CON, and DMN. FPN supports executive functions by initiating and adjusting top-down control (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Dosenbach et al., 2008</xref>). The CON supports salience-related functions and provides stable control over entire task epochs. The suppression of DMN is critical for goal-directed cognitive processes (<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">Spreng et al., 2010</xref>). Cooperation among these top-down control systems of the brain is necessary for controlling attention, working memory, decision making, and other high-level cognitive operations (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Hellyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Raichle, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Ray et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">Spreng, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R99" ref-type="bibr">Vincent et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P54">FPN includes regions such as the intraparietal sulcus that play an essential role in goal-directed cognitive functions <xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">Spreng et al., 2010</xref>) and both spatial and non-spatial visual attention (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Giesbrecht et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Scolari et al., 2015</xref>). The role of central vision in visual processing and object recognition and the need to inhibit distractors in the visual field could (speculatively) be an evolutionary reason central vision representations are preferentially connected to attention regions, including the FPN. Contributions from high-order cognitive areas, like the FPN, help the brain decide which visual areas will be prioritized for visual attention (<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Scolari et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

        <title>Limitations and future directions</title>
        <p id="P55">Our study has several methodological limitations that we will discuss here. Our study used only healthy young adults from the HCP dataset, which could influence our findings’ generalizability. Future work should include individuals from across the lifespan.</p>
        <p id="P56">The task participants completed during the HCP protocol was quite distinct from the previous dataset’s task (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al., 2017</xref>). Here, participants rested quietly, and though their instruction was to keep eyes open, no one assessed if the participants’ eyes were open or closed. In contrast, the Griffis dataset included data from the rest period between blocks of a task, and eye position and lid opening were confirmed via eye-tracking. The fact that these data closely follow each other extends the possible interpretations of the original dataset: the distinction between peripheral and central V1 connectivity generalizes to a new task context.</p>
        <p id="P57">It should also be acknowledged that functional connectivity can be influenced by attention (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Gratton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Salehi et al., 2020</xref>). In both the work by <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al. (2017)</xref> and the current study’s resting-state scan, a fixation cross presented on a screen at the end of the bore, and participants were scanned while inside the MRI bore. Participants may therefore have been allocating more attention toward the visual space in the center (the static screen, subtending roughly 15° visual angle) than the periphery (the bore). However, the fact that we observed complementary effects in the structural data indicates that these data are likely not due to transient states of attention and are likely to represent the biological organization.</p>
        <p id="P58">We acknowledge that large veins near posterior occipital cortex area V1 could impact our functional connectivity measurements in this area (<xref rid="R101" ref-type="bibr">Winawer et al., 2010</xref>). However, we performed extensive preprocessing to reduce the impact of vessels on the results. In addition, the voxel size of our resting state scan is small (2 mm isotropic); this higher resolution should mitigate contributions from nearby veins due to partial voluming effects (<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Schira et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P59">Functional connectivity strengths between V1 to the lateral frontal cortex are on the order of <italic>r</italic> = 0.1 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). While statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), the magnitudes of these functional connections are not as large as connections from V1 to other areas, for example, other portions of the occipital lobe. Functional connectivity magnitudes are always influenced by the preprocessing done to obtain them. In this case, we regressed out the mean signal and regressed out white matter and CSF. While this practice decreases the mean correlation strength (<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Shirer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">Weissenbacher et al., 2009</xref>), it also improves across-subject reliability (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2016</xref>). The debate about this practice, now a decade long, has focused on the interpretability of negative correlations, which we do not do here; our inferences are based on differences in correlations across brain areas.</p>
        <p id="P60">DWI-based tractography produces similar results to tracer methods (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Donahue et al., 2016</xref>); however, probabilistic tractography indirectly traces axon bundles by modeling the path of most restricted water movement and then estimating white matter tracts. Fibers that cross, fan, or converge pose problems for accurately estimating white matter tracts (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Johansen-Berg and Rushworth, 2009</xref>). One way to improve track estimation is by modeling multiple angular compartments (e.g., ball-and-stick model) and using greater than 30 diffusion directions (i.e., 95, 96, and 97 directions in the present study), both of which were used in the present study (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>). Connections described in tractography are non-directional in that no determination of the direction of signaling is acquired. Therefore, the current study cannot interpret the direction (top-down versus bottom-up processing) of the described connections outside of the context of prior tracer studies.</p>
        <p id="P61">Although the present tractography and functional connectivity analyzes aim to measure connections between eccentricity segments of V1 and functional networks, they are inherently different modalities, including but not limited to differences in the measurement of direct and indirect connections between regions. Tractography derived from diffusion-weighted imaging identifies direct connections (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Forkel et al., 2014</xref>), whereas functional connectivity identifies both direct and indirect connections. Therefore, the comparison between them is limited in scope. Since tractography describes direct connections between brain regions, inconsistencies where functional connectivity is present but structural connectivity is not, could be due to multi-synaptic, indirect connections (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Honey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019</xref>). Measuring both structural and functional connectivity provides valuable information to understand the relationship between brain regions that cannot be derived from one modality alone.</p>
        <p id="P62">Future work could help determine the direction of the observed connections and further describe the complexity of direct and indirect connections between V1 and functional networks and examine extrastriate regions that are retinotopically mapped. While we only studied participants with healthy vision, future work should include participants with low vision to investigate possible connectivity changes related to vision loss. This work could serve as a baseline for these low vision studies. Future research could also help inform the plasticity of the described connections in the context of visual training and vision loss.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p id="P63">There is a reliable preference for central representations in V1 to be more strongly connected to the frontoparietal network than peripheral visual representations. This is particularly true for the lateral frontal portions of that network and the Inferior Frontal Gyrus and is true for structural as well as functional connections. This implies that the functional relationship between central V1 and frontal regions is built, at least in part, upon direct, long-distance connections in the IFOF. Understanding how V1 is functionally and structurally connected to higher-order brain areas contributes to our understanding of how the human brain processes visual information and forms a baseline for understanding any modifications in processing that might occur with training or experience.</p>
        <p id="P64">In summary, the work’s main contribution is a greater understanding of higher-order functional networks’ connectivity to the primary visual cortex (V1). Centrally-representing portions of V1 are connected to some frontal cortical regions, including portions of the FPN, both functionally and structurally. The lateral frontal regions where connection differences overlap between structural and functional data have been associated with attention in previous work. This suggests that the central representations of V1 are more tightly coupled to some brain regions involved in attention and cognitive control. Understanding how V1 is functionally and structurally connected to higher-order brain areas contributes to our understanding of how the human brain processes visual information and forms a baseline for understanding any modifications in processing that might occur with training or experience.</p>

        <title>Graphical representation of methods.</title>
        <p id="P71">The figure illustrates from left to right: data used for the two main analyses, the analysis stream, and representations of the results. The top branch shows the analyses for functional connectivity and the bottom branch shows the analysis for structural connectivity. Voxel-wise connectivity to both the central and far-peripheral ROIs were calculated for both modalities. Then patterns of connectivity to central V1 and far-peripheral V1 were compared by paired <italic>t</italic>-test. The patterns from the comparison between central and far-peripheral V1 in both structural and functional modalities were overlaid and compared.</p>

These regions of V1 were used as seed regions in functional connectivity analyses. Central and far-peripheral ROIs were used as target regions for tractography analyses. We sometimes use shorthands like “central V1 ” to refer to these centrally representing regions for brevity.</p>
