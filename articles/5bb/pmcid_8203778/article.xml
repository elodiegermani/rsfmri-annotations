        <p id="Par1">Combining Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG) offers the opportunity to study signal propagation dynamics at high temporal resolution in the human brain. TMS pulse induces a local effect which propagates across cortical networks engaging distant cortical and subcortical sites. However, the degree of propagation supported by the structural compared to functional connectome remains unclear. Clarifying this issue would help tailor TMS interventions to maximize target engagement. The goal of this study was to establish the contribution of functional and structural connectivity in predicting TMSinduced
signal propagation after perturbation of two distinct brain networks. For this purpose,
24 healthy individuals underwent two identical TMS-EEG visits where neuronavigated TMS pulses were delivered to nodes of the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN). The functional and structural connectivity derived from each individual stimulation spot were characterized via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), and signal propagation across these two metrics was compared. Direct comparison between the signal extracted from brain regions either functionally or structurally connected to the stimulation sites, shows a stronger activation over
cortical areas connected via white matter pathways, with a minor contribution of functional projections. This pattern was not observed when analyzing spontaneous resting state EEG activity. Overall, results suggest that structural links can predict network-level response to perturbation more accurately than functional connectivity. Additionally, DWI-based estimation of propagation patterns can be used to estimate off-target engagement of other networks and possibly guide target selection to maximize specificity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par2">Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) allows to transiently perturb the brain in vivo in a control and reliable manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. A compelling way to study the cascade of events induced by an external perturbation is combining TMS with electroencephalography (EEG) which allows to reach a good compromise between high temporal and spatial resolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Notably, the effects of a TMS pulse are not constrained to the portion of local grey matter directly engaged by the stimulation pulse, but rather affect distant cortical and subcortical sites as well, connected to the stimulated region by means of long range projections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Indeed, an external magnetic perturbation initially depolarizes the membrane of the superficial neural tissue underneath the coil, causing an action potential, which then spreads along specific anatomical connections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These transsynaptic distant effects have been previously demonstrated to be dependent on the strength and the nature (e.g. inhibitory or excitatory) of the anatomical connections themselves <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Previous animal studies have shown how the TMS pulse preferentially propagates through structural monosynaptic connections, stressing the importance of the underlying anatomical connectivity between regions and the number of synaptic steps in guiding the observed effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the amount of TMS signal propagation cannot be considered to be solely determined by the underlying anatomical connections of the perturbed region, but to also depend on its initial functional state and connectivity profile as well <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.
</p>
      <p id="Par3">The complexity and organization of the structural and functional connectome can be respectively captured in vivo via diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected during resting-state (rs-fMRI) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The acquired functional spontaneous dynamics can be decomposed into separate but integrated “modules” also known as resting state networks (RSNs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In this context, recent studies have focused on investigating individual RSNs dynamics, demonstrating how the effects of an externally induced network’s node perturbation mainly propagate within distal cortical regions belonging to the same network <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In a recent TMS-EEG study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, we have stimulated two RSNs (i.e. Default Mode Network, DMN, and Dorsal Attention Network, DAN) showing how network-level structural connectivity is more relevant than local and global brain properties in shaping TMS signal propagation. However, even though many studies have evaluated the propagation of the TMS-induced action potentials using DWI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and fMRI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> connectivity metrics, none so far have investigated which of the two techniques is better in capturing the spreading of such TMS-induced signal. Potential differences in the prediction of perturbation patterns via either DWI-based metrics of structural connectivity or rs-fcMRI metrics of functional connectivity, has important fundamental implications regarding the effects of brain stimulation and the significance of the DWI- versus rs-fcMRI-derived connectomes.</p>
      <p id="Par4">In the present study, we initially use fMRI-guided TMS-EEG to selectively perturb one of two neighboring nodes of rs-fcMRI-defined DMN and DAN networks. The DMN and DAN respectively exhibit task-related deactivation and activation during rs-fMRI scanning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. We then characterized the individual structural and functional connectivity profile of the stimulated brain tissue based on biophysical modeling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. For both the DMN and DAN, we evaluated how the TMS pulse propagated to the surrounding nodes based on their structural or functional relationship with the stimulated site. Given that functional connectivity is dependent on physical connection, we hypothesized that DWI-based structural connectivity would be a better predictor of the propagation of TMS effects than the rs-fcMRI-based functional connectivity profile. Additionally, to verify whether propagation patterns observed after stimulation reflect ongoing oscillatory dynamics also present at rest, the same analysis was repeated looking at spontaneous network activity using resting-state EEG recordings which we then compared with the TMS-based perturbation data. Finally, considering the quest for data reproducibility, the same analyses were repeated on data collected on the same sample of healthy individuals across two separate study visits one month apart.</p>

Each participant gave their written informed consent to the study which conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and had been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Twenty-four right-handed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> healthy volunteers (mean age = 32 ± 10 years, ranging from 19 to 49 years) with normal neurological and psychiatric evaluation and no history of drugs acting on the central nervous system were recruited through flyers and on-line advertisement. A pre-TMS MRI assessment was carried out comprehensive of a T1-weighted (T1w) anatomical, a resting state fMRI and a DWI scans. Following each participant carried out two TMS visits, separated by one month, where 120 single pulses were delivered in two neighboring parietal nodes corresponding to the DMN and DAN.</p>

        <p id="Par7">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, to identifying the amount of grey matter directly engaged by the external perturbation, the TMS-induced electric field was modelled with SimNIBS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Given that in literature there is no consensus on how selectively identify only the neural tissue recruited by the TMS pulse <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, we defined the point with maximal E-field and from there created a sphere of radius 0.5 cm. Such region of interest (ROI) was used as seed to performed resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and fiber tractography in order to characterize the individual functional and structural profile associated with the stimulation spot.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Methodological workflow and features extraction. TMS-induced electric field was modelled with SimNIBS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Fiber tractography and resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) were computed from the point with the maximal E-field. As for rs-FC analysis, the final maps were obtained z-transforming, thresholding and FDR-correcting the raw connectivity profile. As for tractography, the reconstructed tract was used to threshold the grey matter map where only the voxels reached by a streamline were retailed. The final rs-FC map and the tract-thresholded gray matter were used to extract the source reconstructed EEG timeseries in order to establish which between functional and structural connectivity mostly predict the TMS-induced signal propagation. The EEG signal was projected at source level using the minimum norm estimation (MNE) method with current density and constraining source dipoles to the cortical surface. The raw time series were first rectified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and then a baseline bootstrapping procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> was applied. Then, 1000 permutation t-test were performed in which the surrogated DWI vs rs-FC difference was computed after each iteration and statistically compared with the real difference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Finally, the cluster threshold was determined as the 95th percentile of the cluster’s surrogate distribution and the area under the curve (AUC) of the significant clusters was extracted within the 350 ms post-TMS period, with positive and negative values indicating that the TMS-EEG signal propagated more on DWI or fMRI projection map, respectively.

        <p id="Par8">As for rs-FC analysis, the positive correlation coefficients were firstly transformed in Z-scores using Fisher’s transformation and then converted into p-values. In order to address the issue of multiple testing comparisons, a false discovery rate (FDR) correction at p &lt; 0.05 was applied to obtain the final rs-FC map representing the grey matter regions positively correlated with the stimulation spot.</p>
        <p id="Par9">As for structural connectivity, a seed-based anatomically constrained tractography <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> was performed from the individual TMS spot to generate a fibers bundle with one million of streamlines of 250 mm maximum length, a backtrack flag and a fiber orientation function cut-off of 0.15. Ventricles and subcortical areas were excluded given that source reconstructed EEG signal cannot be extracted from those regions. The reconstructed tract was used to threshold the grey matter map where only the voxels reached by a streamline were retailed. The remaining voxels represent the cortical regions structurally connected with the stimulation spot.</p>

T1w anatomical images were imported into the Brainsight™ TMS Frameless Navigation system (Rogue Research Inc., Montreal, Canada), and a coregistration procedure was performed using scalp landmarks (nasion, vertex, and the two preauricular points) in order to monitor the coil position. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded with active electrodes positioned on the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and the right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles, while the reference electrode was placed over the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger. EMG data were amplified and digitized using a Powerlab 4/25 T data acquisition system (ADInstruments) at a sampling rate of 4000 Hz (bandpass filtered at 10 Hz to 2000 Hz).

      <p id="Par26">A recent study by our group has used a network-perturbation approach to characterize individual brain dynamics within discrete brain networks with high temporal resolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, demonstrating how intrinsic network structural connectivity provides valuable information to estimate network engagement. Here, we further expand this concept by directly comparing the signal extracted from brain regions either functionally or structurally connected to the stimulation site. Our findings support that white matter pathways are better in addressing the propagation of the action potentials induced by an external perturbation, compared to functionally connected brain regions. Such result was replicable across two separate visits and for two networks, supporting the relevance of macroscale structural connectivity in predicting network-level response to TMS perturbation. Finally, brain structural wiring seems helpful in predicting propagation of activity after a perturbation, but not during spontaneous resting-state activity, suggesting perturbation-based approaches as a valuable tool to investigate the the human connectome.</p>

        <title>TMS-induced propagation is better explained by structural metrics</title>
        <p id="Par27">In line with our expectations, the action potentials induced by an external perturbation mainly propagates within structurally rather than functionally connected regions, nominating the white matter pathways as the principal conductor for TMS-induced signal propagation.</p>
        <p id="Par28">Several experimental and computational studies in modern neuroscience aimed at investigating how rs-FC emerges from the brain's anatomical connections for a better understanding of the structure/function relationship <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Indeed, it has been demonstrated how rs-FC arises and reflect underlying structural anatomy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> even though the inverse relation is not straightforward, given that a functional dependency has also been observed between regions where there is little or no structural connectivity, possibly because of third regions that may act as functional links <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par29">In the context of Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS), previous studies in animals and humans have shown how TMS influences local as well as distant cortical regions through their structural connectivity pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, such as that the nature of the effects has been found strongly affected by the richness of the anatomical connectivity between regions and the number of synaptic steps <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Using rs-FC measures, Eldaief and colleagues have demonstrated how the stimulation of a DMN node (i.e. the posterior cingulate cortex) allowed to indirectly modulate the whole network with divergent effects depending on stimulation conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, rs-FC has been employed to guide therapeutic TMS approaches in clinical settings, with few studies reporting promising results <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and others showing no clinical improvements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Further studies have demonstrated how the induced TMS signal propagates within functionally connected local and distal regions belonging to the same network <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, with concurrent TMS-EEG-fMRI data showing how strong pre-TMS alpha spectral power reduces TMS-evoked hemodynamic activations within the motor system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par30">On the other hand, multiple studies have addressed the importance of white matter microstructural integrity for the propagation of externally induced action potentials <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> with further evaluation of the relationship between functional and structural connectivity using source estimated EEG recording and probabilistic tractography <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. A recent study has used structural connectivity to identify subject-specific targets in the middle frontal gyrus that were connected to a particular portion of the primary somatosensory cortex, demonstrating how TMS applied to this region improved tactile working memory whilst TMS to non-connected portions of the middle frontal gyrus—located just 18 mm away—did not <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Moreover, structural connectivity has been shown to be a reliable and accurate technique for mapping of the course of subcortical pyramidal tracts during intraoperative MEPs evaluation, preserving motor function in patients with gliomas near the pyramidal tracts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par31">In line with previous animal study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, our results demonstrated that white matter pathways better capture the spreading of the action potentials generated by sites structurally connected to the stimulation spot. Such results offer insight for the selection of optimal stimulation targets for maximal network engagement, as well as for the prediction TMS response in clinical populations. It is important to note that connectivity assessed with either technique (rs-fMRI, DWI) involves polysynaptic connections. Indeed, the resolution of DTI is generally not high enough to achieve monosynaptic fiber tracking in vivo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, and rs-FC has been reported between regions in the monkey visual system with no direct anatomical connections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, implying polysynaptic transmission. Related to this, a recent paper published by our group has demonstrated how TMS-induced signal mainly propagates within the stimulated network <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, even though changes in functional connectivity have also been found in other non-stimulated resting state networks reached via polysynaptic connection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In this framework, the present study might encourage the combination of DWI and fMRI data for target selection in order to optimize the engagement within the network of interest. However, prospective studies are needed to causally compare the effects of an external perturbation in a brain region identified using a standard vs a DWI-constrained functional connectivity approach.</p>

        <p id="Par34">Given that the signal induced by an external perturbation propagates more on white matter pathways (rather than functionally connected regions), the interaction between the individual structural connectome and the response to TMS were further investigated. Even though the fiber bundles originated from the stimulated spots mostly reached cortical brain regions belonging to the same network, a conspicuous engagement of the other RSNs was also evident. Specifically, white matter tracts originating from the DMN stimulation seed also reached regions belonging to FPN, whilst fiber pathways originating from the DAN also engaged the SMN network. Interestingly, the negative correlation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and causal interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> between the FPN and the DMN has already been shown in the context of TMS.

Moreover, it is well known that the neural impact of a TMS pulse is not only determined by the properties of that stimulus but also by the initial activation state of the perturbed region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Such state-dependency effect should not presumably affect the source-reconstructed EEG signal measured in brain areas structurally connected with the stimulation spot. On the other hand, in the context of fMRI, previous TMS/task-evoked studies have demonstrated how the effects of an external perturbation are highly dependent on the initial state of the stimulated region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Future studies should investigate the impact of ongoing brain oscillations on the effects of a TMS pulse.</p>
        <p id="Par36">As for diffusion signal, current tractography techniques are known to underestimate inter-hemispheric connectivity—which is substantial between homotopic brain regions—a limitation that has been mitigated by using probabilistic tractography with multiple fiber orientations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the b-value utilized for DWI in this study was relatively low, and diffusion data with higher angular resolution would improve accurate tract identification, especially in regions of crossing fibers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Moreover, given the importance of white matter pathways for the conduction of externally induced action potentials, future studies might employ quantitative MRI techniques combined with advanced biophysical models to measure microstructural features of white matter such as axon diameter, the g-ratio and the overall tract length <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par37">Furthermore, since pre-surgical neuronavigated TMS mapping has been successfully used to provide seed points for fiber tracking based on DWI data when reconstructing the corticospinal tract <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> as well as language-relevant pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>, future scenarios may even extend to the combination of DWI with dual-coil TMS approaches, combining measures of structural and effective connectivity.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p id="Par38">Even though stimulation of brain networks via TMS has been reported to induce activation in functionally connected regions, direct comparison with structural connectivity of the same target regions show a stronger propagation over cortical regions connected via white matter pathways. Additionally, results suggest DWI-based estimation of propagation patterns can be used to estimate off-target engagement of other resting-state networks and possibly guide target selection to maximize specificity in future studies.</p>
