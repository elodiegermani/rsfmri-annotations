        <p>Agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) is a rare congenital malformation characterized by partial or complete absence of the corpus callosum (CC). The effects of AgCC on cerebral structural and functional networks are not clear. We aimed to utilize AgCC as a model to characterize the relationship between brain structure and function. Diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state fMRI data were collected from nine AgCC and ten healthy subjects. The interhemispheric functional connectivity (FC) was quantified using a voxel-mirrored-homotopic-connectivity (VMHC) method, and its correlation with the number (FN) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the fibers crossing the CC was calculated. Graph-based network analyses of structural and functional topologic properties were performed. AgCC subjects showed markedly reduced VMHC compared to controls. VMHC was significantly correlated with the FN and FA of the fibers crossing the CC. Structural network analyses revealed impaired global properties, but intact local properties in AgCC compared to controls. Functional network analyses showed no significant difference in network properties between the groups. Finally, in both groups, brain areas with more fiber connections were more likely to build a positive FC with each other, while areas with decreased white matter connections were more likely to result in negative FC. Our observations demonstrate that interhemispheric FC is highly dependent on CC structure. Increased alternative intrahemispheric SC might be a compensatory mechanism in AgCC that helps to maintain normal global brain function. Our study provides insights into the underlying neurological pathophysiology of brain malformations, thereby helping to elucidate the structure–function relationship of normal human brain.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="p0030">The relationship between brain function and structure has been studied for decades (<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Park and Friston, 2013</xref>), yet many questions remain unanswered, e.g. how rich functionality emerges from the structural architecture of the brain. Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has provided insights into the association between brain structure and function. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Le Bihan et al., 2001</xref>) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Biswal, 2012</xref>) are two MRI procedures that can measure brain structure and function respectively. DTI captures the molecular diffusion of water along white matter fibers and thereby provides a measure of white matter structures (namely structural connectivity, SC). Rs-fMRI can measure the statistical properties of the neural activities from different brain regions (i.e. functional connectivity, FC). FC has previously been shown to correlate with SC at an aggregate level both in healthy controls (HC) (<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Honey et al., 2009</xref>) and in disease conditions (<xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Kozel et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Miguel-Hidalgo, 2013</xref>). Although it is intuitive that functional networks rely on the structural network (<xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Straathof et al., 2019</xref>), it is still unclear to what extent FC is determined by SC (<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Park and Friston, 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p id="p0035">The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest white matter structure connecting the two brain hemispheres. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the CC may play a major role in maintaining homotopic FC in the brain. Agenesis of corpus callosum (AgCC) is a rare congenital malformation in which callosal fibers are congenitally partially or fully absent and is caused by different genetic or environmental factors during prenatal development (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Calabrò et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, AgCC can serve as a good neuroanatomical model for understanding human neuroplasticity and the relationship between SC and FC in certain developmental abnormalities (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Meoded et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Tovar-Moll et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p id="p0040">Despite the dramatic differences in white matter structure, several prior studies found no significant difference in basic cognition and intelligence between AgCC subjects and HC (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Calabrò et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2007</xref>). Rs-fMRI studies also found that global FC was nearly intact in AgCC (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Owen et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Tyszka et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that indirect or local polysynaptic pathways were utilized to preserve remote FC in AgCC subjects (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Owen et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Tyszka et al., 2011</xref>). However, the actual functional-structural changes involved in this disease are still unknown (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Roland et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, what brain areas are mainly connected by the corpus callosum (CC) in the healthy brain? Would these brain areas show decreased inter-hemispheric or homotopic FC with impaired CC? If they do, does the extent of homotopic FC disruption reflect the proportion of anatomical impairment?</p>
      <p id="p0045">To address these issues, we adopted a voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) approach (<xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Mancuso et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Tovar-Moll et al., 2014</xref>) to examine interhemispheric functional synchrony and to investigate its relationship with structural properties, indicated by the number (FN) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the CC fibers in both AgCC and HC. We identified the structural connections that are highly reliant on the CC by probabilistic tractography and explored the dependency of FC on SC. Lastly, we used topographic theory on DTI and rs-fMRI data to study the global SC and FC at the network level in AgCC and HC. VMHC quantifies the FC between each voxel in one hemisphere and its mirrored counterpart in the other hemisphere (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Hung et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Owen et al., 2013b</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Ridley et al., 2016</xref>). Graph-based approaches model the brain as a complex network represented graphically by a collection of nodes and edges. In the virtual graph, nodes indicate anatomical elements (e.g., brain regions) and edges represent the relationships between nodes (e.g., connectivity) (<xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). After the network modeling procedure, various graph theoretical metrics can be used to investigate the organizational configuration of the brain networks (<xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Since the VMHC method quantifies inter-hemispheric FC in a voxel-wise manner, while traditional graph-based network analysis quantifies the overall connectivity pattern among all the regions of the brain and characterizes the global organization of the whole brain, VMHC might be more sensitive than graph-based approaches in this case. In addition to investigating the structural and functional deficits in AgCC subjects, our main goal was to reveal the general relationship between FC and SC. We hypothesized that: 1) the VMHC method would reveal interhemispheric FC changes in AgCC that traditional graph-based methods failed to detect; 2) disrupted homotopic brain FC is associated with impairment of the CC white matter in AgCC subjects; 3) stronger SC is generally associated with stronger FC.</p>

          <p id="p0080">VMHC assumes symmetric morphology between hemispheres. As this assumption does not hold for real brains, images must be transformed before VMHC can be calculated. Therefore, in our study anatomical and functional images were transformed to fit a symmetric template (<xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2010</xref>) using the REST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://restfmri.net/forum/rest" id="ir020">http://restfmri.net/forum/rest</ext-link>) software. Lastly, VMHC was computed as the Pearson correlation of the BOLD time course between any pair of symmetric interhemispheric voxels.</p>

          <title>Resting-state functional network analyses</title>
          <p id="p0085">To evaluate the overall network topology of FC in AgCC subjects, we adopted a graph-theoretic approach (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Hung et al., 2019</xref>). For the region of interest (ROI) based network analyses, the mean time course was extracted from 116 cortical and subcortical ROIs from the automatic anatomic labeling (AAL) atlas. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between each pair of all 116 ROIs. Then, a Fisher r to z transformation was applied to improve the normality of these correlation coefficients. For each pair of seed regions within one hemisphere, the homotopic regions in the opposite hemisphere defined the intrahemispheric and interhemispheric networks, respectively. Compiling all of the correlation coefficients results in a 116 × 116 adjacency matrix that denotes the strength of the temporal coupling (edges) between each pair of regions (nodes).</p>
          <p id="p0090">FC matrices were binarized at various threshold (0.01:0.25) in the two groups. Based on these binarized matrices the following six commonly used graph-theory measurements were calculated by using Gretna Toolbox (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Owen et al., 2013b</xref>, <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>): degree, small-worldness (Sigma), mean clustering coefficient (Gamma), shortest characteristic path length (Lambda), global efficiency (Eg), and local efficiency (Eloc) (<xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

After head motion and eddy current corrections, each subject’s DTI dataset was registered to the same individual’s high-resolution structural image and then into the standard MNI space using affine transformations. Specifically, the FA map of each subject was calculated in native space and was affinely co-registered to its corresponding T1-weigted images. Then, T1-weighted images were nonlinearly registered to the MNI space. The inverse transformations were obtained to the above two steps to transform the AAL atlas from MNI space to diffusion native space. Lastly, a voxel-wise calculation of the tensor matrix yielded FA, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD).</p>

          <p id="p0100">A whole-brain deterministic tractography approach was performed using the fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT) algorithm (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Mori et al., 1999</xref>). Fiber tracking was terminated at voxels where FA &lt; 0.2 or where the angle between two eigenvectors was greater than 45°. The CC structure for each subject was manually traced on the T1 image and cross-validated on the FA image. FN and FA of the fibers crossing the CC were calculated for each subject and their correlation with VMHC was estimated.</p>

          <title>Probabilistic tractography</title>
          <p id="p0105">Although deterministic tractography is suitable for the quantification of the white matter fibers of large structures like CC, it may underestimate the fiber numbers connecting two smaller brain regions and get false negative results, and it is difficult to capture crossing fibers within one voxel. Probabilistic tractography with Bayesian Estimation of Diffusion Parameters Obtained using Sampling Techniques (Bedpostx) (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>) can solve this problem. Hence, except for the quantification of FN and FA of the fibers crossing CC as mentioned above, all the following DTI analyses, including SC network construction, graph-based analysis of the SC network, and the CC structural network identification were performed with probabilistic tractography.</p>
          <p id="p0110">The Bedpostx runs Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to build up distributions on diffusion parameters at each voxel, and models crossing fibers within each voxel of the brain and automatically determines the number of crossing fibers per voxel, where the diffusion coefficient is modelled using a Gamma distribution. After Bedpostx estimation has been applied, we performed probabilistic tractography analyses. Briefly, the procedure produces sample streamlines, by starting from a seed and then iterating between (1) drawing an orientation from the voxel-wise Bedpostx distributions, (2) taking a step in this direction, and (3) checking for any termination criteria. 5000 streamlines were generated. These sample streamlines can then be used to build up a histogram of the number of streamlines connecting two brain regions. The SC value was estimated based on this streamline distribution, and was corrected by the length of streamlines. Hence, the SC value represents the normalized posterior probability of white matter connections between two brain areas.</p>
          <p id="p0115">T1-weighted MR images were automatically segmented using DARTEL (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner and Friston, 2009</xref>). The 116 AAL regions were used as the seed points for the aforementioned probabilistic tractography. The resulting 116 × 116 SC matrix reflects the distribution of pairwise white matter connections, i.e. SC values, between nodes. The SC matrices were then used to assess the network properties. The network graph topology analysis was performed with the same procedure as the rs-fMRI data.</p>

          <title>Identifying the corpus callosum structural network</title>
          <p id="p0120">To identify the structural connections that are highly reliant on the corpus callosum, namely “CC structural network”, we first performed two probabilistic tractography analyses, one with and one without the CC mid-way point mask (as an “inclusion ROI” for probabilistic tractography) between each pair of the 116 brain regions of HC, respectively, then a percentage matrix was generated by the ratio between the matrixes achieved above, i.e. with/without the CC midpoint mask. Finally, the CC structural network was determined by the percentage matrix with the assumption that one connection is considered to be significantly relying on the CC if its percentage matrix value is higher than 90%.</p>

          <p id="p0125">To identify the differences in inter-hemispheric FC between the two groups, we performed two-sample t-tests on the VMHC maps (corrected p &lt; 0.05 with voxel-level p &lt; 0.05 and cluster size &gt; 54 voxels, as determined by the AlphaSim correction (<xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2011</xref>)).</p>
          <p id="p0130">We then extracted the mean VMHC values from the clusters showing significant differences between the two groups and correlated the mean VMHC values with the FN and FA values separately for the AgCC and HC groups. To further evaluate the dependence of interhemispheric FC on the CC structure in healthy condition, we performed a voxel-wise correlation analysis between the VMHC maps and FN/FA of fibers crossing the CC (FN/FA values obtained using deterministic tractography), across HC subjects.</p>
          <p id="p0135">We used two-sample t-tests to compare the Fisher z-transformed SC and FC matrices acquired from probabilistic tractography and rs-fMRI network analysis, respectively, as well as the SC matrices of the CC structural network (acquired from probabilistic tractography) between the AgCC and HC groups. To assess the statistical significance of group comparisons of SC metrics, we used a nonparametric permutation. For each metric, the data labels were randomly reassigned between the two groups and t values were computed for each relabeling, for a total of 5000 permutations. P values were calculated on the basis of the distribution of t values obtained from the permutations and were adjusted for multiple comparisons with an FDR correction. For statistical comparisons of the FC between groups, we utilized the Network-Based Statistics (NBS) method (<xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Zalesky et al., 2010</xref>). A <italic>t</italic> test was applied to assess the statistical significance of between-group comparisons of the network metrics. A total of 10,000 permutations were performed to estimate the null distribution and associations with t &gt; 3 were analyzed by NBS. An FWE-corrected significance level of p &lt; 0.01 was used. The brain networks were visualized with the BrainNet Viewer for Matlab 2015a (<xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
          <p id="p0140">The five graph-theory based network measurements were compared between groups at different thresholds and a significant difference was accepted if the p value was less than 0.05 at each threshold. Age and gender were included in the model as covariates of nuisance.</p>
          <p id="p0145">In addition to calculating the correlation coefficient between the whole-brain SC (all the elements in the 116 × 116 SC matrix achieved by probabilistic tractography described in the section 2.3.6) and FC values (all the elements in the 116 × 116 FC matrix described in the section 2.3.3), we generated a two-dimensional histogram to visualize the relationship between SC and FC. The height of the histogram indicates the number of connections (edges) between pairs of brain regions (nodes), while the horizontal plane indicates the distribution of SC and FC. The same analysis was performed again across the connections within the CC network only, i.e. the connections that rely heavily on the CC structure. The mean SC and FC values of the connections within the CC structural network were compared between the AgCC and HC groups using two-sample t-tests.</p>

It is notable that although the same number of streamlines were generated for each ROI, the total number of connections crossing through the CC (height of the histograms) is significantly lower in the AgCC compared to the HC (t = 4.01, p &lt; 0.001). Scatter plots also showed significant positive correlations between whole brain SC and FC values in HC (r = 0.22, p &lt; 0.001) and AgCC (r = 0.21, p &lt; 0.001), as well as between the SC and FC that reliant on the corpus callosum in HC (r = 0.15, p &lt; 0.001) and AgCC (r = 0.10, p &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B, left). The mean SC values within the CC structural network are significantly lower in the AgCC group than that of HC (t = −3.84, p &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B, middle). However, there was no significant difference in the FC values within the CC structural network between the two groups (t = −0.35, p = 0.86) (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B, right).<fig id="f0030"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>The relationship between structural and functional connectivities.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="p0200">We report three major findings. First, AgCC subjects showed markedly reduced VMHC compared to HC. The VMHC was significantly correlated with the quantity and quality of the fibers crossing the CC structure in normal brains. Second, structural network analyses revealed impaired global properties (decreased global efficiency, small world index, and mean degree, increased characteristic path length and mean betweenness), but relatively intact local properties (clustering coefficient and local efficiency) in AgCC subjects compared to controls. We did not find significant differences in functional network properties between the two groups. Third, in both AgCC subjects and controls, brain areas with more fiber connections are more likely to demonstrate a positive FC with each other, while brain areas with fewer white matter connections are more likely to have negative FC.</p>

        <title>Dependence of interhemispheric FC on corpus callosum</title>
        <p id="p0205">The extent to which interhemispheric FC depends on the CC is uncertain, and previous studies have offered contradictory evidence (<xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Uddin, 2013</xref>). The occurrence of bilaterally symmetric independent components in the AgCC group together with intact global functional network properties demonstrates unambiguously that interhemispheric functional integration can exist in the absence of structural connectivity (<xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Tyszka et al., 2011</xref>). Evidence from electroencephalography (EEG) studies also show that there are no significant differences in any frequency band between homologous pairs of electrodes between subjects that have undergone a corpus callostomy and those with an intact CC (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Casimo et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, changes in functional connectivity in AgCC may not be severe enough to be detectable by those approaches.</p>
        <p id="p0210">Our study demonstrates that VMHC (<xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2010</xref>), which quantifies the FC between each voxel in one hemisphere and its mirrored counterpart in the other, is a more sensitive method for detecting abnormality in AgCC cases. The VMHC was significantly decreased in the sensorimotor, visual, and frontal areas in the AgCC subjects compared to the HC, suggesting that the CC is important for VMHC in these areas. Previous studies also found that the VMHC values vary from region to region (<xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2010</xref>). Primary sensorimotor cortices associated with large and fast callosal fibers present higher VMHC, while associative cortices, characterized by small and slow axons, have relatively lower VMHC (<xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2010</xref>). These observations in our current study are consistent with a previous report (<xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Stark et al., 2008</xref>). All of these evidences reflect the relationship between VMFC and anatomical features of white matter tracts of CC: faster conduction fibers are likely to produce tighter synchronization of neurophysiological signals.</p>
        <p id="p0215">To what extent would the CC structure be related to the degree of functional integration across hemispheres as indexed by VMHC? This question was tested by correlating the robustness of the CC bundles with the VMHC values. Strikingly, the dependency of VMHC on the CC structure was more significant in the HC group alone, but not significant in the AgCC group (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The tight link between the CC structural connection and VMHC in HC suggests that normally the interhemispheric neural synchrony is dependent on the quantity and quality of the fibers of CC. While both structural and functional connections between two hemispheres decreased dramatically in AgCC patients. Compensatory side pathways, intrahemispheric structural connections, the symmetry of cerebral blood perfusion, and other physiological factors likely affect the interhemispheric FC values in AgCC subjects, and may explain the lack of correlation between VMHC and FN/FA in AgCC.</p>

        <title>Increased intrahemispheric structural/functional connections as compensatory mechanisms in AgCC</title>
        <p id="p0220">Recent work on structural connectivity in adults and children with AgCC has shown that the absence of long-range interhemispheric callosal fibers results in reduced information transmission and integration between the cerebral hemispheres (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Jakab et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Meoded et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Owen et al., 2013b</xref>). Additionally, increased local structural connectivity and a more segregated network organization have been observed in these subjects (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Meoded et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Owen et al., 2013b</xref>). Some evidence for white matter circuit reorganization in AgCC has been reported (<xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Tovar-Moll et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>), but no rewiring of any kind has been identified in adults subjected to a callosal transection or “split brain” operation. Congenital agenesis of the CC permits developmental adaptive reorganization (<xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Paul, 2011</xref>), therefore, individuals without a CC from birth frequently exhibit less severe symptoms of disconnection syndrome. Whole-brain probabilistic fiber tracking in the current study revealed significantly decreased interhemispheric SC, but increased intrahemispheric fiber connections in the AgCC subjects. The SC small-worldness, clustering coefficients, and global efficiency were also higher in the AgCC subjects than in HC. These results may likely reflect the profound rearrangement of cortical and subcortical connectivity within the cerebral hemispheres due to the formation of pre- and postnatal structural compensatory mechanisms.</p>
        <p id="p0225">The published literature and our current results indicate that a normal complement of resting-state networks and intact functional coupling between the hemispheres can emerge in the absence of the CC. Although the FC between some brain areas decreased significantly, there was no significant decrease in the global and local functional efficiency in the AgCC group. We even observed increased FC degrees in the left hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, and pallidum. These increased FC are consistent with our DTI findings of increased white matter connections between the subcortical limbic areas and cortical areas in AgCC. Previous studies also indicated that the compensatory FC in AgCC individuals was associated with enhanced cerebral plasticity during childhood, possibly allowing the recruitment of alternative neural structures to enable interhemispheric communication through the subcortical structures, anterior, intercollicular, or posterior commissures (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Beaule et al., 2015</xref>), such as the previously described Probst and sigmoid bundles (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Jakab et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Tovar-Moll et al., 2014</xref>). The enhanced FC in AgCC is unilateral in the left limbic area. It has been reported that the subcortical limbic regions in the left and right hemispheres typically show differentiated asymmetric functional activities in normal subjects (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Raemaekers et al., 2018</xref>). A recent study with normal subjects also found that brain areas with fewer callosal connections were more likely to develop lateralized functions (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Karolis et al., 2019</xref>), Therefore, the AgCC subjects may develop lateralized asymmetric functional pathways to compensate for the possibility of impairments in language, movement, and social communication functions. The unilateral changes of FC in AgCC, might be associated with the dominant role of the left hemisphere in the above processing (<xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Hodgson and Hudson, 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Raemaekers et al., 2018</xref>), Further studies with paradigms targeting unilateral hemisphere specialization are required to examine brain functional lateralization. In our present study, there were no significant differences in performance on neuropsychological tests between the two groups, and the finding fits with the functional imaging evidence, which confirmed that subjects with AgCC might have acquired the compensatory neural plasticity for maintaining these functions (<xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Tovar-Moll et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, the increased intrahemispheric SC and FC serves as an important compensatory mechanism and helps to maintain basic brain function in AgCC individuals. These evidences highlight the importance of heterotopic connectivity of the CC and ipsilateral associative pathways that help distribute information within each hemisphere (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Roland et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
        <p id="p0230">The divergent results from SC and FC network analyses indicate that although SC contributes to FC, it only partially shapes functional organization which is consistent with the expected greater number and flexibility of functional networks as compared to structural networks that is noted in earlier studies.</p>

        <title>The structural basis for the positive and negative FC</title>
        <p id="p0235">Although the distribution of SC and FC values across the whole brain are similar between AgCC and HC (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A first row), the total number of connections crossing through the CC is lower in the AgCC compared to the HC, indicating that there is a significant loss of CC connections in the AgCC condition, and it mainly affects the interhemispheric SC rather than global SC.</p>
        <p id="p0240">FC has been widely used in studying normal brain function and neuropathological changes in various brain diseases. However, the structural basis for positive or negative FC is still unknown. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the dependency of FC on the SC. Our results showed that brain areas with stronger SC (higher fiber density and larger FA) were more likely to have a positive FC. This phenomenon was seen in both HC and AgCC groups. Probabilistic tractography with the CC as mid-way point showed that the functional connectivities were not always positive for those brain areas that were mainly connected by the CC structure, as some of them showed negative FC. However, brain areas with more fiber connections showed positive FC and brain areas with fewer fiber connections showed negative FC. Abnormal correlation or anti-correlation between different brain networks has been proposed as a potential neural biomarker for certain diseases, such as major depressive disorders, autism, bipolar disorders, and schizophrenia. The current study may help us to further understand the structural basis for diminished anti-correlation or abnormal FC in these diseases and inspire the development of new treatments that can modify the fiber connections between certain brain areas.</p>
        <p id="p0245">Although FC is known to largely reflect patterns of SC (<xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Meier et al., 2016</xref>), the former is not entirely predictable on the basis of the latter (<xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Uddin, 2013</xref>). It is usually found to exceed it (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Damoiseaux and Greicius, 2009</xref>). For example, in this study, the presence of strong SC is predictive of FC, but strong FC could still be detected between what appear to be structurally unconnected regions. This non-linear relationship between SC and FC is thought to reflect the complexity of FC that arises from indirect polysynaptic pathways or due to multiple external driving forces. Therefore, both structural and functional connectivity should be considered as complementary approaches to investigate the human connectome at a large-scale level.</p>
        <p id="p0250">One of limitations of our study was notable; the proportion of left-handed subjects in AgCC group was higher than that in the HC group, which might be due to a compensatory mechanism for the disconnected homotopic motor areas. Unfortunately, we couldn’t examine the exact mechanism behind this interesting phenomenon because of the low number of subjects. The major goal of the current study was to examine the relationship between SC and FC, and we did not find statistically significant differences between including and excluding the handedness as a covariate, indicating that the main effects of group difference and the correlations (for instance, FC and SC) were much stronger than the effect of handedness.</p>
        <p id="p0255">In summary, our study revealed the important role of the CC structure in maintaining interhemispheric FC and clarified the general relationship between structural and functional connectivities, using AgCC as a model. These results can provide new insights into the underlying neurological pathophysiology of brain malformations and thereby also help elucidate the structure–function relationship of the normal human brain.</p>
