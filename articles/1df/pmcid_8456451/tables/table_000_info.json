{"table_id": "T1", "table_label": "Table 1", "table_caption": "Results for parcels that that were either of a priori interest or that were significant on the illusory-fragmented task activation analysis (see Fig. 2 ). The rows were sorted in descending order, first, by the percentage of subjects showing the effect in the group direction (column 2) and then, by the percentage of subjects showing significant effects on the individual subject analysis (column 3). The prefix of each parcel name (\u201cL_\u201cor\u201cR_\u201d) indicated its hemisphere. The fourth and fifth columns indicate a parcel\u2019s ROI status (yes/no) and functional network. The next three columns indicate whether a parcel was significant after FDR correction, whether it remained significant when task conditions were matched on accuracy/RT, and whether it was significant using the predicted ActFlow data. In the final column, we show the average task activation difference, with more positive values indicating more illusory relative to fragmented activation.", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_000.csv"}
