      <abstract>
        <p>Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies frequently applied the spatial normalization on fMRI time series before the calculation of temporal features (here referred to as “Prenorm”). We hypothesized that calculating the rs-fMRI features, for example, functional connectivity (FC), regional homogeneity (ReHo), or amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in individual space, before the spatial normalization (referred to as “Postnorm”) can be an improvement to avoid artifacts and increase the results’ reliability. We utilized two datasets: (1) simulated images where temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) is kept a constant and (2) an empirical fMRI dataset with 50 healthy young subjects. For simulated images, the tSNR is constant as generated in individual space but increased after Prenorm and intersubject variability of tSNR was induced. In contrast, tSNR was kept constant after Postnorm. Consistently, for empirical images, higher tSNR, ReHo, and FC (default mode network, seed in precuneus) and lower ALFF were found after Prenorm compared to those of Postnorm. Coefficient of variability of tSNR and ALFF was higher after Prenorm compared to those of Postnorm. Moreover, the significant correlation was found between simulated tSNR after Prenorm and empirical tSNR, ALFF, and ReHo after Prenorm, indicating algorithmic variation in empirical rs-fMRI features. Furthermore, comparing to Prenorm, ALFF and ReHo showed higher intraclass correlation coefficients between two serial scans after Postnorm. Our results indicated that Prenorm may induce algorithmic intersubject variability on tSNR and reduce its reliability, which also significantly affected ALFF and ReHo. We suggest using Postnorm instead of Prenorm for future rs-fMRI studies using ALFF/ReHo.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), which uses blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal to measure spontaneous brain activity, has been developed and widely applied in neuroscience and clinical research studies (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Raichle, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Raichle, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Haak et al., 2018</xref>). However, the reliability of rs-fMRI indices was recently concerned and challenged (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Xing, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2019a</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Low reliability led to the demands for huge sample size or large effect size to achieve enough statistical power, which were both difficult for rs-fMRI studies. Therefore, it is important to find an optimized data processing strategy that can give out higher reliability of rs-fMRI features (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2019b</xref>).</p>
      <p>A typical data processing step in rs-fMRI is spatial normalization, which achieves between-subject comparison in voxel level but may also induce spatial–temporal correlation and resampling errors (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Worsley, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). To date, how to estimate precise spatial transformation from an individual space into standard space has been widely discussed (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mazziotta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Calhoun et al., 2017</xref>). Besides, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2011)</xref> compared two normalization strategies about its order in preprocessing. One is “Prenorm,” which means performing the spatial normalization on each fMRI image of each time point into standard space. Then calculate the certain temporal feature of the time series, for example, functional connectivity (FC) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Biswal et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Raichle, 2015</xref>), regional homogeneity (ReHo) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jiang and Zuo, 2016</xref>), or amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2013</xref>). This Prenorm strategy has been widely used in large portion of fMRI studies from a decade ago until recently (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Archer et al., 2018</xref>) and was the default option in several popular pipeline tools like DPABI and GRENTA (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Yan and Zang, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). The other is “Postnorm,” which is to first calculate these feature maps in individual space, and then perform the normalization. <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2011)</xref> reported a slight difference of the value of FC and ALFF between such two strategies, and notably, they also found that Prenorm strategy may increase intersubject variability of ALFF in individual space, but Postnorm did not. Putatively, larger variability may lead to lower reliability and indicated that widely used Prenorm may be a worse choice than Postnorm. However, it is still unclear if this effect is an algorithmic bias and if and how it may affect the reliability of rs-fMRI features.</p>
      <p>In the current study, we aim to systemically investigate and compare the Prenorm and Postnorm strategies: (1) To verify if it is a pure algorithmic effect, we investigate if and how normalization can induce across-subject variation on a simulated dataset, which has a constant temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) in individual space for all subjects and all voxels. (2) To investigate if and how the value and intersubject variability of tSNR as well as commonly used rs-fMIR indices including ALFF, FC, and ReHo were different under different normalizations. Additionally, if the intersubject variability in empirical images affected algorithmic effect. (3) To investigate the test–retest reliability of ALFF, ReHo, and FC in an empirical fMRI dataset.</p>

          <title>Empirical Images</title>
          <p>We downloaded one subset of the public database “Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility, CORR,” which is named “BNU1” (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2014</xref>). The downloading Web address can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/CoRR/html/_static/downloads.html">http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/CoRR/html/_static/downloads.html</ext-link>. There were 57 healthy young subjects (male/female: 30/27; age: 19–30 years) in this data cohort. For each subject, there were two serial scans, which were acquired within the interval of 40.94 ± 4.51 days. These images were all scanned on a SIEMENS TRIO 3T scanner in Beijing Normal University, all subjects signed an informed consent, and the data were well-anonymized before uploading. Structural MRI data were acquired using an MPRAGE sequence: 128 sagittal slices, repetition time (TR) = 2,530 ms, echo time (TE) = 3.39 ms, inversion time (TI) = 1,100 ms, slice thickness = 1.33 mm, field of view (FOV) = 256 × 256 mm<sup>2</sup>, and voxel size = 1.33 × 1.00 × 1.00 mm<sup>3</sup>. rs-fMRI data were obtained using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence: 33 axial slices, TR = 2 s, TE = 30 ms, slice thickness = 3.5 mm, gap = 0.7 mm, FOV = 200 × 200 mm<sup>2</sup>, and voxel size = 3.1 × 3.1 × 4.2 mm<sup>3</sup>, with 200 dynamics in total. The current study only used fMRI and T1 data, and seven subjects whose T1 or BOLD data are incomplete were excluded. Therefore, 50 subjects were included finally (23.05 ± 2.29 years, male/female: 30/20). In the current study, the first scan was used for all of the analyses, and the second scan was only used in the test-retest reliability analysis.</p>

          <title>Simulated Images</title>
          <p>A simulation was performed based on the empirical rs-fMRI. The simulated images were generated from empirical rs-fMRI in individual space by the following processes: (1) For each voxel, a random white noise time course with same length (190 time points after removing the first 10) of empirical images was generated; (2) the signal intensity was normalized to maintain the mean intensity of the time course as constant value equal to 1,000, and tSNR equal to 100. These values were comparable to those in the brain regions of our empirical images. Therefore, the simulated images had constant tSNR value across different voxels, different subjects in the individual space, and in a same individual space to the corresponding empirical images.</p>

        <sec id="S2.SS2.SSS1">
          <title>Preprocessing</title>
          <p>The empirical fMRI images were preprocessed in DPABI (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). The pipeline procedure included the following steps: (1) discarding the first 10 volumes; (2) slice timing; (3) head motion correction; (4) regressing out the nuisance variables [including six head motion parameters and their derivatives, the average cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM) signal, and the linear term]. A band-pass filter (0.01–0.08 Hz) was additionally added for FC and ReHo but not for tSNR and ALFF.</p>

        <sec id="S2.SS2.SSS2">
          <title>Spatial Normalization Parameters</title>
          <p>The structural T1-weighted images were coregistered to fMRI for each subject. Based on the coregistered structural images, normalization parameters were estimated using the unified segmentation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner and Friston, 2005</xref>) in SPM12 for each subject and each scan. These normalization parameters were used to normalize each fMRI image in each time point in Prenorm strategy as well as normalize the ALFF, ReHo, and FC maps calculated in individual space in Postnorm strategy. When normalizing these fMRI images, the voxel size in MNI space was set as 3 × 3 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>, and the bounding box was set as [−90, −126, −72; 90, 90, 108]. We use this default setting of DPABI whose voxel size is comparable to those in individual space to reduce the differences of the voxel number before and after normalization. The interpolation was set as “Trilinear,” which is the default option in DPABI and in SPM.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="S2.SS2.SSS3">
          <title>tSNR, ALFF, and FC Calculations</title>
          <p>We first calculated the tSNR, ALFF, ReHo, and FC in individual space. In each individual space, tSNR, ALFF, ReHo, and seed-based FC of default mode network (DMN) were calculated after the preprocessing. Specifically, the rs-fMRI time series in an individual space after preprocessing were translated to frequency domain by a fast Fourier transform, and the ALFF value was defined as the average square root across the low-frequency band of 0.01–0.08 Hz (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zang et al., 2007</xref>). The ReHo value in one voxel is defined as the Kendall coefficient of concordance among it and its 26 neighbor voxels (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2013</xref>). For FC, the seed was defined as a 6-mm radius spherical region of interest (ROI) centered at [−5, −49, 40] in MNI space, located at precuneus (PCu), which is a classic seed ROI of DMN (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). To calculate in individual space, the seed ROIs were inversed normalized into each of the individual spaces, and then the FC value of each voxel was defined as the correlation between BOLD signal in this voxel and the average BOLD signal within the seed ROI.</p>
          <p>tSNR, ALFF, ReHo, and FC in MNI space under two different strategies were then calculated. Under the Prenorm condition, the spatial normalization was applied to both simulated images and preprocessed empirical images. The tSNR, ALFF, ReHo, and FC maps were calculated for each subject in MNI space. For Postnorm, the tSNR, ALFF, ReHo, and FC in MNI space were generated by performing spatial normalization directly on tSNR, ALFF, ReHo, and FC maps in individual space.</p>
          <p>For FC, a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was applied for both Prenorm and Postnorm. The regions showed significant positive results in either strategy (GRF correction by DPABI, voxel <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, cluster <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, compared to zero) and were defined as a DMN mask that is used to exclude the voxels with very low FC values, which is often not interested in rs-fMRI studies.</p>
          <p>For simulated images, it was generated by replacing the time courses of the empirical fMRI. The spatial normalization of each corresponding subject can also directly be applied on the simulated images. Specifically, for Postnorm, the tSNR map was calculated in individual space and then transformed into MNI space. As expected, the tSNR value is constant among all voxels and subjects both before and after normalization. For Prenorm, the simulated images were first normalized and tSNR maps were calculated based on these normalization images. We did not calculate ALFF, FC, and ReHo for simulated images.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the current study, we have demonstrated: (1) Prenorm strategy can change the tSNR values and induce intersubject variability from simulated images with constant tSNR. (2) The features of empirical fMRI including tSNR, ALFF, ReHo, and FC would be different between Prenorm and Postnorm. Furthermore, the intersubject variability of these were also different between normalization strategies. (3) Importantly, the algorithmically induced intersubject variation of tSNR under Prenorm in simulated images can explain the intersubject variation in empirical results of tSNR, ALFF, and ReHo. (4) The ICC values of tSNR, ALFF, and ReHo for Prenorm are significantly lower than those of Postnorm.</p>
      <p>It is not a surprise that spatial normalization can increase the tSNR compared to it in individual space. A previous study indicated that resampling and interpolation in both Prenorm and Postnorm may superimpose spatial autocorrelation on fMRI data (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). This “additional smoothing” may suppress the noise contribution in fMRI signal (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Krüger and Glover, 2001</xref>) and directly lead to increased tSNR. In our simulation, we use white noise with constant tSNR and found that Prenorm increased tSNR value while Postnorm did not. This result indicated that Postnorm, which does interpolation on scalar values, may have less effect than Prenorm, which interpolated the time courses. The results in empirical images were very consistent with this assumption. Prenorm has higher tSNR, therefore less total variation, which leads to smaller ALFF, but higher correlation both among local voxels (ReHo) and between distinct regions (FC), as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
      <p>However, most rs-fMRI studies are interested in the intersubject difference rather than the value of rs-fMRI indices. Given that there is no individual difference and no neural signals in our simulated images, the intersubject variability after Prenorm in simulated images was putatively induced by algorithmic reasons. We suspected that it may be induced by the fact that the extent of the deformation during spatial normalization varied across subjects, which can determine the extent of resampling and interpolation. Interpolation can increase tSNR, and therefore intersubject difference of interpolation directly leads to intersubject variability of tSNR. Again, this effect in Postnorm seems weaker, which has no effect in simulation (resampling would not change constant), and smaller effect in empirical images (CV of tSNR is less in Postnorm than that in Prenorm). Consistent result was found for CV of ALFF, which is larger in Prenorm. However, ReHo and FC showed different results. This is possibly caused by increased FC and ReHo values in Prenorm compared to those in Postnorm, especially in DMN for FC and in all gray matter regions for ReHo. This effect may overwhelm the effect of increased intersubject variability of the noise level. Therefore, when in WM where there may be less neural signals, ReHo showed increased CV in Prenorm than that in Postnorm, which is consistent with tSNR. It is also worth to note that ReHo is differently defined in Prenorm and Postnorm given the range of “neighbor voxels” that are actually different; this may lead to these complex differences (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Prenorm tSNR in empirical images is highly correlated across subjects with Prenorm tSNR in simulated images, indicating that the algorithmic effect in simulated images can also explain the intersubject variability of tSNR in empirical fMRI. Moreover, similar widespread significant correlation was found between simulated tSNR and empirical ALFF and ReHo. The negative correlation for ALFF is expected since higher tSNR means lower total variation, which can be reflected by ALFF (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Garrett et al., 2013</xref>). These results further indicated that there is a significant portion (for the significant regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.1) of the intersubject variability of ALFF and ReHo that can be explained by pure algorithmic effect of resampling and interpolation during normalization if Prenorm is used. Given that most rs-fMRI studies focused on between-subject differences, this indicated that for ALFF and ReHo, the Prenorm strategy may need to be avoided.</p>
      <p>Consistent with the algorithmic induced intersubject variability, ICC between two serial scans further suggested that using Prenorm would decrease the test–retest reliability of rs-fMRI features compared to Postnorm. Less reliability may lead to less statistical power, low reproducibility, and demand of big data size (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Button et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Poldrack et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hedge et al., 2018</xref>) and has been recently highlighted as a challenge in fMRI field (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett and Miller, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Xing and Zuo, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2019a</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Therefore, our findings strongly suggested that all of the rs-fMRI studies using ALFF and ReHo in the future use Postnorm instead of Prenorm. Although ICC of FC seems to be not sensitive to the normalization strategy compared to ALFF and ReHo, given that the Prenorm can induce variability of tSNR and the fact that noise level can affect FC values (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Duff et al., 2018</xref>), FC studies also should choose normalization strategies with caution. Also, given that the increased variability of fMRI features may be caused by the geometrical difference during normalization, special caution should be taken with spatial normalization when investigating the functional–structural relationship (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Di et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Qing and Gong, 2016</xref>) or investigating the population that may have various degrees of brain atrophy, like dementia (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Qing et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">De Vos et al., 2018</xref>). It is also worth noting that the effect of Prenorm is more severe in subcortical and WM regions. Therefore, studies that focus on WM BOLD signal and subcortical spontaneous activity should be more cautious with choice of spatial normalization strategy or just avoid spatial normalization (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Makedonov et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Qing et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is worth to note that the effect of normalization may be related to the interpolation methods. In the current study, we use the “trilinear” interpolation because it is the default setting of most fMRI data processing toolboxes, such as FSL (“fnirt”), SPM (Normalization-Write), and AFNI (“3dAllineate”), and therefore has been widely applied. We also repeated our analysis using “nearest neighbor,” fourth and seventh B-spline interpolation options, which were provided in SPM. When using “nearest neighbor,” exactly the same ALFF and tSNR would be found for Prenorm and Postnorm, but there were slight differences for ReHo and FC, which may be caused by different definitions of neighbor voxels and seed time course in different strategies (details can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Material</xref>). This validated that difference effects of interpolation on time course and scalar values lead to our finding of the difference between Prenorm and Postnorm. For higher order interpolation, such as fourth or seventh B-spline, most of our findings still showed similar and significant results compared to “trilinear” but with more conservative effect size (however, some results were inversed, see the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Material</xref>). However, using nearest neighbor may decrease smoothness of the results, and it is time-consuming to use higher order interpolation, especially when treating large data cohorts. Additionally, other type of interpolation like using sinc function instead of linear may also have an impact but was more rarely be used during spatial normalization (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Strother et al., 2004</xref>). At last, when large kernel spatial smoothing was done, the additional interpolation among voxels would attenuate the effect of interpolation during normalization, and therefore we did not include and discuss this step for simplicity.</p>
      <p>There are some limitations of the current study. First, we only use the unified segmentation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner and Friston, 2005</xref>) to perform the normalization. Although we believe that the effect of Prenorm on temporal features is independent to the different estimating methods of spatial transformation, the finding in the current study still need to be validated against other normalization algorithms, such as DARTEL in SPM (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner, 2007</xref>), utilization of the EPI templates instead of structural templates (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Calhoun et al., 2017</xref>), and also other toolboxes, such as FSL (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Jenkinson et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, our results were based on a relatively small publicly available dataset that only included 50 subjects, which all have the same scanning parameters and using the same scanner. The current findings need further validation across various types of scanners, various image resolutions, and a larger dataset in the future.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that the commonly used spatial normalization, Prenorm, may induce an artificial variability across subjects on tSNR of rs-fMRI and significantly contribute to the intersubject variability of ALFF and ReHo and reduce their reliability compared to Postnorm. These results suggest that future fMRI studies using ALFF and ReHo should perform spatial normalization with caution and suggest Postnorm as an improvement.</p>
