Clustering coefficient Cp,"Ci is formed by a direct connection to the nearest neighbours of the node i, which measures the segregation of the network [???]."
Clustering coefficient Cp,The Cp of a network is the average of Ci over all nodes [???].
Characteristic path length Lp,"Lp is the average of all of the shortest path lengths between two pairs of nodes, which may be regarded as a measurement of network integration [???]."
Normalized clustering coefficient γ,"γ is the average of Cp, which is further normalized by comparing to 1000 matched random networks [???]."
Normalized characteristic path length λ,"λ is the average of Lp, which is further normalized by comparing to 1000 matched random networks [???]."
Small-worldness σ,"σ is the ratio of γ to λ. The network topology may be considered to correspond to a “small world” if γ > 1, λ ≈ 1, or if σ > 1 [???]."
Global efficiency Eglob,"Eglob and Eloc are the biologically sensible topological features of the brain networks, which describe the global and local efficiency of information transmission of the network [???]."
Local efficiency Eloc,"Eglob and Eloc are the biologically sensible topological features of the brain networks, which describe the global and local efficiency of information transmission of the network [???]."

"Normalized degree, Deg(i)",Normalized Deg(i) is the mean Deg(i) of 1000 matched random networks. Deg(i) is the number of connections of node i that connect it to the rest of the network.
"Normalized node betweenness, NB(i)",Normalized NB(i) is the mean NB(i) of 1000 matched random networks. NB(i) may be used to compute the effects node i that has over the stream of information between all other nodes in the network.
Normalized local efficiency Eloc(i),Normalized Eloc(i) is the mean Eloc(i) of 1000 matched random networks. Eloc(i) is defined as the inverse of the average shortest path length between node i and all other nodes. This variable is a measure of information transfer from node i to all other nodes of a network [???].
Normalized clustering coefficient γ(i),γ(i) is the mean γ of 1000 matched random networks.
