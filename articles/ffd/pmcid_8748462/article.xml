        <p id="Par1">This study aimed to identify functional neuroimaging patterns anticipating the clinical indication for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). A cohort of prospectively recruited patients with PD underwent neurological evaluations and resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) at baseline and annually for 4 years. Patients were divided into two groups: 19 patients eligible for DBS over the follow-up and 41 patients who did not meet the criteria to undergo DBS. Patients selected as candidates for DBS did not undergo surgery at this stage. Sixty age- and sex-matched healthy controls performed baseline evaluations. Graph analysis and connectomics assessed global and local topological network properties and regional functional connectivity at baseline and at each time point. At baseline, network analysis showed a higher mean nodal strength, local efficiency, and clustering coefficient of the occipital areas in candidates for DBS over time relative to controls and patients not eligible for DBS. The occipital hyperconnectivity pattern was confirmed by regional analysis. At baseline, a decreased functional connectivity between basal ganglia and sensorimotor/frontal networks was found in candidates for DBS compared to patients not eligible for surgery. In the longitudinal analysis, patient candidate for DBS showed a progressively decreased topological brain organization and functional connectivity, mainly in the posterior brain networks, and a progressively increased connectivity of basal ganglia network compared to non-candidates for DBS. RS-fMRI may support the clinical indication to DBS and could be useful in predicting which patients would be eligible for DBS in the earlier stages of PD.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par2">Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders affecting millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by motor symptoms, such as resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, as well as non-motor manifestations including autonomic dysfunction, behavioral and cognitive impairments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The progressive death of the pigmented neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta is the principal pathological hallmark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Several treatments, including medications, surgery and supportive therapies, are currently available to help relieve symptoms and maintain an acceptable quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par3">Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a well-established therapy for PD and few treatments are as effective as DBS for controlling the troubling motor symptoms of PD, levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Currently, indications of DBS for PD are based on general and clinical characteristics. The following factors have to be carefully assessed before recommending surgery to a given patient: disease duration (of at least 4 years according to the Earlystim clinical trial)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, levodopa responsiveness, type and severity of motor symptoms, cognitive and psychiatric issues, comorbidities, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Even with established indications to DBS, key questions remain unanswered. It is not yet clear, in fact, how the clinical benefit with DBS is achieved, why some symptoms (e.g., tremor) respond more quickly than others, and why the therapeutic benefits of DBS still vary among PD patients. The correct selection of the optimal candidate to DBS for PD may play a significant role in this variability.</p>
      <p id="Par4">The recent advances in the field of neuroimaging are continuously expanding our knowledge of the brain areas and circuits underlying the clinical expression of PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Resting-state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in particular, can provide a detailed description of how the disease alters the functional brain organization and further allow to make new hypotheses about PD physiopathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. More recently, RS-fMRI studies demonstrated that functional connectivity patterns may identify different clinical clusters of PD or predict motor benefit from DBS, and that altered functional brain networks correlate with PD motor and cognitive severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par5">To our knowledge, there are no studies investigating functional neuroimaging features in PD patients eligible for DBS before becoming clinical candidates for surgical treatment, probably due to the lack of large cohorts of PD patients prospectively followed with brain MRI. For this purpose, in this study, we investigated functional connectivity patterns in two cohorts of PD patients over time, including both patients eligible for DBS over time and cases with comparable disease duration and stage but not meeting the criteria to undergo DBS treatment; patients selected as candidates for DBS did not undergo surgery at this stage. We aimed to investigate brain network differences before patients became eligible for DBS, how they change over time in both groups, and to look into identifying an early predictive biomarker of indication to DBS.</p>

        <p id="Par6">Nineteen PD patients became eligible for DBS over the follow-up, whereas 41 patients did not meet the criteria to undergo future surgery. Candidates for DBS over the follow-up became eligible on average 26.53 ± 8.45 months from the study entry (range, 12–48), according to the following clinical indications: medication-resistant tremor in 4/19 patients (21.05%), motor fluctuations, and dyskinesia impairing quality of life in 11/19 patients (57.9%), and medication-resistant tremor and dyskinesia in the remaining 4/19 patients (21.05%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Flowchart illustrating the inclusion/exclusion of participants in the study.</title><p>Chart data for 154 patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) prospectively recruited at the Clinic of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 60 patients were included in the study. The study cohort was then divided in two groups: 19 patients eligible for DBS treatment and 41 patients who did not meet the criteria to undergo DBS over time. Patients were assessed by clinical, cognitive/behavioral, and brain MRI evaluations at study entry and every year for a maximum of 4 years.

        <p id="Par7">Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample at baseline and their changes over time are described in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. No differences in age and sex were found among the groups. Both patient groups had lower education and worse cognitive and behavioral performances relative to controls (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Patients eligible for DBS and those not eligible did not differ in terms of education, age at onset, PD duration, site of onset, and Hoehn and Yahr (HY) score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> at baseline. At baseline, candidates for DBS were characterized by more severe motor signs and symptoms than non-candidates (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). More specifically, the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> total, part II, part III and part IV scores were worse in the former than in the latter group of patients (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Over follow-up, both PD groups showed motor clinical progression (i.e., UPDRS total, part II, part III, part IV) and increased levodopa equivalent daily dosage (LEDD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Furthermore, patients eligible for DBS showed a more severe worsening of UPDRS IV score relative to non-candidates for surgery. However, they did not undergo surgery at this stage. Cognitive and behavioral features were similar between the two PD groups at baseline, except for language which was more impaired in candidates relative to non-candidates for DBS over the follow-up (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Over follow-up, both PD groups showed a progressive worsening of cognitive functions (mainly in the executive, attentive and visuospatial domains); only patients eligible for DBS were characterized by alterations of memory tests over time and they showed a more severe worsening of attentive functions relative to the other group (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic and clinical features of Parkinson’s disease patients and healthy controls.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Variables</th><th>HC</th><th>Candidates for DBS</th><th>Non-candidates</th><th><italic>p</italic>: Candidates for DBS vs HC</th><th><italic>p</italic>: Non-candidates vs HC</th><th><italic>p</italic>: Candidates for DBS vs Non-candidates</th><th><italic>p</italic>: for linear trend, Candidates for DBS</th><th><italic>p</italic>: for linear trend, Non-candidates</th><th><italic>p</italic>: for differential trend between PD groups</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>N</italic></td><td>60</td><td>19</td><td>41</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Age at MRI [years]</td><td>61.79 ± 8.98 (46.14–77.72)</td><td>61.09 ± 7.32 (48.86–73.59)</td><td>61.96 ± 6.38 (49.09–82.95)</td><td>1.00</td><td>1.00</td><td>1.00</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sex [Men/women]</td><td>29 (48.33)/31 (51.67)</td><td>11 (57.9)/8 (42.1)</td><td>25 (61)/16 (39)</td><td>0.32</td><td>0.15</td><td>0.52</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Education [years]</td><td>13.52 ± 2.57 (8.00–16.00)</td><td>11.21 ± 3.06 (4–16)</td><td>12.34 ± 2.31 (8–17)</td><td>0.003</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.35</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Handedness [right/left/both]</td><td>46 (92) 4 (8) 0 (0)</td><td>18 (94.7) 1 (5.3) 0 (0)</td><td>36 (87.8) 4 (9.8) 1 (2.4)</td><td>0.58</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.64</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Age at onset [years]</td><td>–</td><td>52.05 ± 7.94 (42.0–64.0)</td><td>54.63 ± 6.45 (43.0–71.0)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0.19</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Disease duration [years]</td><td>–</td><td>8.94 ± 5.55 (4.28–23.93)</td><td>7.42 ± 3.65 (4.00–16.86)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0.24</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Family history [No/yes]</td><td>–</td><td>16 (84.2) 3 (15.8)</td><td>34 (82.9) 7 (17.1)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0.61</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Side of onset [Right/left/both]</td><td>–</td><td>12 (63.2) / 7 (36.8) / 0 (0)</td><td>25 (61.0) / 15 (36.6) / 1 (2.4)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0.79</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Hoehn &amp; Yahr</td><td>–</td><td>2.32 ± 0.74 (1–3)</td><td>1.94 ± 0.60 (1–3)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0.19</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>0.85</td></tr><tr><td>UPDRS total</td><td>–</td><td>65.00 ± 17.59 (28–90)</td><td>49.66 ± 17.35 (15–79)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0.002</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>0.06</td></tr><tr><td>UPDRS I total</td><td>–</td><td>3.84 ± 3.97 (0–12)</td><td>3.27 ± 2.99 (0–12)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0.54</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>0.16</td></tr><tr><td>UPDRS II total</td><td>–</td><td>14.21 ± 4.66 (3–21)</td><td>10.39 ± 4.49 (1–20)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0.004</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>0.07</td></tr><tr><td>UPDRS III T</td><td>–</td><td>43.68 ± 14.36 (14–62)</td><td>34.71 ± 13.34 (12–55)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0.02</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>0.67</td></tr><tr><td>UPDRS IV Total</td><td>–</td><td>3.26 ± 2.51 (0–9)</td><td>1.29 ± 1.69 (0–6)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0.01</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>0.04</td></tr><tr><td>Levodopa equivalent dose [mg]</td><td>–</td><td>882.63 ± 398.59 (0–1530)</td><td>679.15 ± 322.42 (0–1140)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0.07</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>1.00</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are reported as mean ± standard deviation (range) or absolute and percentage frequency (%) for continuous and categorical variables, respectively.

On the contrary, candidates for DBS were characterized by increased functional connectivity involving connections from basal ganglia to occipital, temporal, sensorimotor, and frontal insular areas, where non-candidates presented stable connectivity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Both groups were characterized by a similar trend of change over time (second condition), with or without significant statistical difference between the two groups, within temporal, parietal, frontal insular, and sensorimotor networks and between frontal insular-temporal regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par17">Resting-state functional connectivity is now considered a valuable measure of disease progression and provides biomarkers to monitor functional changes in PD, as well as in other neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. For the first time, the present RS-fMRI study provides new insights into the dynamic evolution of brain networks in PD patients eligible or not for DBS surgery due to its longitudinal design. A major strength of the study, with regards to candidates for DBS, was the evaluation of connectivity features several years before becoming clinically eligible for DBS treatment.</p>
      <p id="Par18">At baseline, the two PD groups had similar demographic features, disease stage, and duration. However, although candidates for DBS met the criteria for neurostimulation treatment over time, their motor characteristics and brain connectivity already differed from the other group of patients at study entry. Indeed, the study revealed the following main findings at baseline: (i) hyperconnectivity of the posterior brain regions (occipital and occipital-parietal regions) as well as increased mean nodal strength and local efficiency of the occipital areas in the group of candidates for DBS relative to both healthy controls and patients not eligible for DBS; (ii) decreased connectivity between basal ganglia and both sensorimotor and frontal regions in candidates for DBS compared to non-candidates for surgery. Increased functional connectivity is a common finding in neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, but the mechanism underlying it is still unclear. It may simply reflect the primary disease process or appear in response to altered function elsewhere in the brain (often explained as a compensation mechanism). Several authors explored basal ganglia-sensorimotor functional connectivity in PD patients reporting that levodopa medications significantly increase their connectivity;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> on the contrary, both PET and RS-fMRI studies showed that a metabolic and functional connectivity increase in the posterior areas may be a downstream effect of functional changes in the basal ganglia-sensorimotor areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that the baseline findings we reported may be secondary to worse response to dopaminergic therapy in candidates for DBS than in non-candidates for neurostimulation (also confirmed by more severe motor signs and symptoms in the former group despite a slightly higher LEDD) leading to basal ganglia-sensorimotor connectivity reduction as well as an increase in posterior region connections.</p>
      <p id="Par19">Over time, patients eligible for DBS were characterized by a more severe clinical motor progression than the other group of patients. In reference to fMRI analysis, PD patient groups showed different brain network changes/reorganization over the years. Our longitudinal RS-fMRI findings, in fact, reveal widespread brain network changes when the group of candidates for surgery over time became clinically eligible for DBS.</p>
      <p id="Par20">We hypothesize that the decreased functional connectivity of posterior regions over time represents a progressive loss of the initial ability to compensate for a dysfunction in the sensorimotor/frontal-basal ganglia networks that already exist at study entry in the group of patients eligible for DBS.</p>
      <p id="Par21">The progressively increased nodal strength and local efficiency in the basal ganglia region in patients not eligible for DBS and the increased functional connectivity of the basal ganglia networks in candidates for DBS relative to non-candidates could be secondary to the increased LEDD over the years in both groups. Despite the increased functional connectivity of basal ganglia was higher in the group of candidates for DBS (probably due to a greater LEDD increase), these patients showed more severe motor progression becoming thus eligible for DBS. These findings could be explained by reduced efficacy of dopaminergic medication over time and, at least partially, by the reduced connectivity in the posterior regions in patient candidate for DBS.</p>
      <p id="Par22">We suppose that considering surgery sooner during the course of the disease would prevent or delay not only motor signs and symptoms but also brain circuit alterations, being those causes or consequences of the motor impairment. Recent data, in fact, support this idea considering DBS treatment far earlier than currently applied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Findings by the Earlystim study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> suggested that DBS at earlier stages of PD is associated with substantial clinical benefits, widening the spectrum of patients with PD eligible for such a treatment.</p>
      <p id="Par23">In patients eligible for DBS over time we found that increased functional connectivity in the occipital areas was positively related to tremor severity (UPDRS III tremor subscore) at study entry and up to 36/48 months from the baseline. In patients who were not eligible for DBS over time, the functional connectivity within basal ganglia was negatively related with bradykinesia (UPDRS III bradykinesia subscore), UPDRS III, and UPDRS IV. From the pathophysiological perspective, PD is typically attributed to the dysfunction of the basal ganglia networks, including the striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit, triggered by a deficit in dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, as previously shown, this theory can explain symptoms like bradykinesia, but largely fails to explain tremor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In several clinical studies, the severity of tremor is independent of the amount of dopamine deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, whereas some post-mortem studies showed that PD patients with tremor have less dopaminergic dysfunction than non-tremor patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Our findings contribute to improving the knowledge of a complex picture revealing the potential contribution of cortical regions in tremor symptoms.</p>
      <p id="Par24">This study is not without limitations. First, the sample size is relatively small and progressively reduces over time, mainly at 36 and 48 months. This issue may explain why NBS analysis did not reach the global statistical significance after permutations in all the comparisons including candidates for DBS. Further studies with a larger patient population are needed to confirm and support our results. Secondly, PD patients were assessed in ON status. However, our analysis accounted for both LEDD at baseline and changes over time. Thirdly, we did not have longitudinal RS-fMRI data in healthy controls. Thus, we cannot ignore that part of the functional reorganization we observed in patients might be related to aging effects. Furthermore, we used a 1.5 T MRI scanner, which is characterized by a lower BOLD signal-to-noise ratio compared with higher field scanners. Moreover, patients selected as candidates for DBS did not undergo surgery at this stage. Future analyses with electrode reconstruction in the preoperative RS-fMRI space would be crucial to evaluate the relationships between the investigated functional networks and postoperative clinical outcomes. Lastly, it would be interesting to develop a connectivity machine-based learning technique that leads to a robust prediction model for better establishing which patients would be eligible for undergoing DBS according to functional connectivity features; going forward, a wider sample of PD patients would be necessary.</p>
      <p id="Par25">To conclude, this study showed different connectivity networks in PD patients eligible or not to DBS, suggesting for the first time that graph analysis and connectomics might represent a powerful approach to help clinicians establish the correct indication to DBS in PD. More precisely, specific RS-fMRI features, such as occipital hyperconnectivity and/or basal ganglia-sensorimotor/frontal hypoconnectivity together with progressively increased connectivity between basal ganglia and sensorimotor/frontal areas and decreased connectivity in the posterior regions, could be potential red flags in favor of the DBS procedure. The implementation of the current clinical criteria and the routine brain MRI with network analysis may not only support the clinical indication to DBS but could also be useful in predicting which patients would be eligible for undergoing DBS in the earlier stages of PD, thus allowing to treat patients before the occurrence of brain circuit alterations.</p>

Subsequently, according to motor symptoms and signs, general clinical information, LEDD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and cognitive and mood data, the PD population was divided into two groups: (1) patients eligible for DBS if they suffered from troublesome dyskinesia and/or severe motor fluctuations causing reduced quality of life despite medications adjustment, and/or refractory marked tremor over 4 years; (2) patients who did not meet the criteria to undergo DBS surgery over the follow-up. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 60 patients were enrolled in the study (19 candidates and 41 non-candidates for DBS over time); notably, patients selected as candidates for DBS did not undergo surgery at this stage.

The resulting images were registered into the RS-fMRI native space of each subject through a seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) linear affine transformation using FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool.

Brain parcellation was performed as described above. The diffusion-weighted data were skull stripped by using the Brain Extraction Tool implemented in FSL.

This eddy current and motion correction step combines rigid body three-dimensional motion correction (six parameters) with constrained nonlinear warping (eight parameters) based on a model of the expected eddy current distortions. Previous transformations were concatenated to a further affine transformation calculated to register DW images onto the MNI space and were applied to DW data.

Fiber tracking was stopped if the reconstructed fiber entered a voxel with FA &lt;0.15, if the streamline made a turn with a curvature angle of more than 45°, or when the trajectory of the traced fiber exceeded the brain mask. An individual brain network was obtained for each healthy control by using the following procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. First, the streamlines from the whole-brain tractogram touching each couple i and j of nodes were selected. Then, the number of streamlines for each of these tracts was calculated and inserted in an adjacency matrix. If there was no streamline connecting a couple of nodes, then a zero was inserted in the corresponding cell to describe the lack of connections between those nodes. To avoid the presence of spurious fibers, we set to zero all connections with fewer than three fibers. Moreover, to avoid considering spurious connections in our analysis, we set to zero the connections that were present in less than 40% of the independent healthy control sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. This procedure was repeated for each i and j couple of nodes, resulting in a connected undirected weighted matrix. Functional connectome matrices are dense and we need to apply a threshold in order to avoid spurious functional connections. Up to date, there is no standard technique to threshold connectivity matrices. In order to be as conservative as possible, we decided to study functional connectivity only where an anatomical connection is present masking functional matrix with a structural one. Finally, we masked the functional matrices of patients and controls included in our study using the structural matrix obtained from the independent healthy control sample. If the anatomical connection was not present in the structural matrix, we set to ‘not a number’ the corresponding correlation coefficient in the functional matrix of patients and controls.</p>

          <p id="Par38">NBS compared functional connectivity between groups adjusting for age and sex. NBS is a nonparametric test and has the potential of identifying any connected component and a network comprising functional connectivity differences between groups. Per each between-group comparison, the test statistic is computed for each functional connection, obtaining corresponding <italic>p</italic> values (one <italic>p</italic> value per connection). Connections presenting a <italic>p</italic> value &lt;0.05 are considered to be part of the altered functional connectivity pattern. The principal (or largest) connected component and the smaller clusters of altered connections (secondary), which are not included in the principal connected component, are then identified (red and green connections, respectively, in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). At this point, since the inherent massive number of multiple comparisons that must be performed and the great effort in testing the normality per each connection, the permutation test is used to ascribe a <italic>p</italic> value controlled for the family-wise error to the considered altered functional connectivity pattern. The permutation test re-samples <italic>N</italic> times the total number of observations in the subject group to build an empirical estimate of the null distribution from which the test statistic has been drawn. The p values obtained after 10,000 permutations are reported in the result section for each comparison (i.e., the global significance of the altered functional connectivity pattern). Then, regardless of global statistical significance after permutations, the mean functional connectivity values of the resulting altered connections (in both the principal and secondary components) were obtained and compared between groups using age- and sex-adjusted ANOVA models, followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons, Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, R Statistical Software).</p>

Furthermore, correlations between fMRI measures at baseline and clinical scales at each time point (12, 24, 36/48 months) were also explored using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), to evaluate the possible effect of brain functional network alterations on clinical progression in PD groups.
