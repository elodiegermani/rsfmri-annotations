      <abstract>
        <p>Functional disability due to spatial neglect hinders recovery in up to 30% of stroke survivors. Prism adaptation treatment (PAT) may alleviate the disabling consequences of spatial neglect, but we do not yet know why some individuals show much better outcomes following PAT than others. The goal of this scoping review and meta-analysis was to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying prism adaptation (PA). We conducted both quantitative and qualitative analyses across fMRI studies investigating brain activity before, during, and after PA, in healthy individuals and patients with right or left brain damage (RBD or LBD) due to stroke. In healthy adults, PA was linked with activity in posterior parietal and cerebellar clusters, reduced bilateral parieto-frontal connectivity, and increased fronto-limbic and sensorimotor network connectivity. In contrast, RBD individuals with spatial neglect relied on different circuits, including an activity cluster in the intact left occipital cortex. This finding is consistent with a shift in hemispheric dominance in spatial processing to the left hemisphere. However, more studies are needed to clarify the contribution of lesion location and load on the circuits involved in PA after unilateral brain damage. Future studies are also needed to clarify the relationship of decreasing resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) to visuomotor function.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Among stroke survivors in the acute and subacute inpatient settings, approximately 30% have spatial neglect, which is more common after right than left brain damage (RBD and LBD, respectively) [<xref rid="B1-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Spatial neglect can occur in individuals with other types of brain injury as well [<xref rid="B2-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Spatial neglect is a neuropsychological syndrome that results from damage to the neural networks critical to the processing of spatial information and the control of attention [<xref rid="B5-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The syndrome typically induces abnormal bias toward the space ipsilateral to the injured cerebral hemisphere, and hence, affected individuals pay insufficient or no attention to the contralesional side, which cannot be attributed to primary sensory or motor defects [<xref rid="B7-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Symptoms of spatial neglect can be observed across domains (perception, representation, memory, movement planning, and motor control) and perceptual modalities (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive) [<xref rid="B9-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. </p>
      <p>Spatial neglect has a significant clinical impact as it hinders rehabilitation progress and outcomes [<xref rid="B13-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Prism adaptation treatment (PAT) is one of the interventions that can reduce symptoms of spatial neglect and improve functional outcomes [<xref rid="B17-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the results of randomized sham-controlled trials in stroke patients are mixed with respect to unequivocal benefits of this treatment for all stroke patients [<xref rid="B19-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is unknown what determines the short-term beneficial effects and long-term therapeutic effects of PAT. In this article, we reviewed theoretical accounts for PAT mechanisms, conducted a series of meta-analyses of the available fMRI studies to determine what brain regions are activated before, during, and after prism adaptation, and built upon a framework that may improve the understanding of PAT effects on sensorimotor and cognitive plasticity as a way to augment recovery in patients with spatial neglect. </p>

        <title>1.1. A Brief History</title>
        <p>Charles S. Harris was one of the first authors who conducted systematic experiments on prism adaptation. In his 1963 study, participants (with unspecified neurological background) were instructed to point to a central visual target 90 times while wearing wedged prism lenses that shifted the visual field to the left or right by approximately 11 degrees of visual angle. Harris observed the effects of prism adaptation after prism removal, i.e., after-effects, when asking participants to point to visual targets without seeing their arm and hand, to auditory targets with eyes closed, and straight ahead with eyes closed [<xref rid="B24-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Participants erroneously pointed toward the side of space opposite to the lens shift (see <xref rid="brainsci-11-01468-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> for an illustration). Many replicated and expanded Harris’s observations in healthy individuals and found that the after-effects usually fade in a few minutes and are rarely detectable after about an hour depending on the measurement [<xref rid="B25-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Nonetheless, what was learned from these early studies is that prism adaptation is a sensorimotor phenomenon that occurs without effortful strategy learning, and it temporarily alters motor behavior in a manner that is not necessarily determined by vision. </p>
        <p>More than three decades after Harris’s article (1963) was published, Yves Rossetti et al. [<xref rid="B28-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported their application of prism adaptation in RBD individuals with left-sided neglect. Patients made 50 pointing movements to visual targets while wearing wedged prism lenses that shifted the visual field to the right by 10 degrees of visual angle (experimental condition) or flat thick lenses that induced no visual displacement (sham-control condition). Prism adaptation after-effects similar to those reported by Harris [<xref rid="B24-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] were observed. More importantly, Rossetti et al. observed effects on neuropsychological tests sensitive to spatial neglect symptoms immediately after prism removal and two hours later [<xref rid="B28-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This groundbreaking finding has inspired a new research area in the field of neurorehabilitation. Studies have focused on the visibility of pointing movements during adaptation [<xref rid="B29-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the degree of visual shift induced by prism lenses [<xref rid="B31-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the measurement of after-effects [<xref rid="B32-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and PAT effects on different frames of reference (more effective in egocentric than allocentric neglect) [<xref rid="B33-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. </p>
        <p>Many questions about PAT remain unanswered. We do not yet know how PAT effects expand from simple visuomotor tasks (e.g., reaching to a visual target) to functional tasks that may or may not be visuomotor in nature (e.g., grooming activities, text reading, postural balance) [<xref rid="B35-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and to tasks that are not visuomotor at all (e.g., mental imagery) [<xref rid="B36-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The fact that patients can adapt to prisms (indicated by the presence of after-effects) and demonstrate improved symptoms of spatial neglect suggests that a common level of egocentric spatial representation is shared in sensorimotor adaptation, multi-modal and multi-domain integration, and higher-level cognitive spatial functions. Furthermore, while several studies investigated the neural mechanisms of a single session of prism adaptation (PA) and its after-effects [<xref rid="B37-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], it is still unknown what brain areas support neuroplasticity associated with long-term effects of PAT, which subserve improvements in symptoms and severity of spatial neglect and in daily-life functions. To fill these knowledge gaps, it is important to understand the mechanisms of spatial neglect, of prism adaptation and its after-effects, and of the accumulated changes after multiple sessions of PAT. The present review is a first step toward a better understanding of the neuro-rehabilitative mechanisms of PAT and neuroplasticity associated with lasting improvement after PAT.</p>

        <title>1.2. Neural Mechanisms of Spatial Neglect</title>
        <p>Animal models of spatial neglect (rat, cat, and monkey) have revealed a well-characterized cortico-subcortical circuitry involved in directional orienting [<xref rid="B40-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This circuitry includes cortico-striatal projections from visual and parietal areas to the superior colliculi and substantia nigra, as well as pathways linking the cerebellum and medial frontal/cingulate areas with brainstem oculomotor nuclei [<xref rid="B40-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B44-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Unilateral lesions to cortical or collicular components of this circuit result in contralesional neglect. Such lesions upset the balance of activity between the two hemispheres, resulting in hyper-activation of the uninjured hemisphere. Consistent with the animal literature, spatial neglect in humans is associated with a partly overlapping set of lesions in parietal, frontal, temporal cortex, fronto-parietal white matter, corpus callosum, superior colliculi, caudate nucleus, and thalamus [<xref rid="B44-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Although human data do not show the profound interhemispheric rivalry found in animals, there is evidence of hemispheric imbalance. Neglect is associated with abnormal dorsal and ventral parieto-frontal-temporal connectivity, intra- and interhemispheric parietal, frontal, and occipital disconnection, and a loss of segregation of functional neural networks within each hemisphere [<xref rid="B46-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggests that spatial neglect is not a “parietal cortex issue” or a “cortical disorder” but stems from a disruption of a widespread neural network.</p>

        <title>1.3. Neural Mechanisms of Prism Adaptation (PA)</title>
        <p>PA is a sensorimotor phenomenon achieved through two hypothetical stages of recalibration and realignment. Recalibration reflects the strategic adjustment of spatially coded movement commands aimed at rapidly reducing reaching errors, whereas realignment is a slower process of progressive remapping between visual and proprioceptive coordinate frames [<xref rid="B49-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The neural bases of PA and its two stages have been studied in individuals with spatial neglect and in healthy participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, the findings are inconclusive. The paradigms used in these studies and their findings vary. For example, studies differed with respect to the types of prism goggles used during PA (neutral, leftward, or rightward deviating prisms, 5–20° shift of visual angle) and the nature of the pointing movement (e.g., finger pointing, laser pointing, or imaginary finger pointing), as well as at what timepoint brain activity was recorded (before, after, or during PA) and in which participants (healthy controls or stroke patients). Some studies in healthy individuals implicate the parietal cortex playing a key role in recalibration during the early phase of PA and the cerebellum in realignment of coordinate systems during the later phase of PA [<xref rid="B50-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In contrast, some studies suggest the involvement of both the cerebellum and the posterior parietal areas in all phases of PA [<xref rid="B51-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], with possible sub-specialization of parts of the cerebellum and parietal cortex (e.g., lobule VIII, IX involved in early strategic learning; lobule VI involved in later realignment) [<xref rid="B53-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Other studies suggest that PA may alter the balance of activity in bilateral parietal, frontal, and temporal regions [<xref rid="B37-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B54-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and alters resting state fronto-parietal, parieto-temporal, and frontal-limbic connectivity [<xref rid="B56-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In RBD patients with left-sided neglect, the effects of PA on brain activation differ from those in healthy participants and involve bilateral or left circuits [<xref rid="B37-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In short, there is a growing pool of fMRI studies seeking to understand the neural mechanisms underlying PA and its after-effects. However, the results of these studies are mixed, which likely stems from differences in methodology and the subject population. </p>

        <title>1.4. Present Study</title>
        <p>Based on the currently available evidence, we hypothesize that PA in healthy individuals relies on the right posterior parietal areas and bilateral cerebellum, with potentially different parts of the cerebellum engaged by early strategic recalibration and later progressive realignment of sensorimotor systems. Furthermore, among patients with spatial neglect, PA effects are hypothetically associated with one of two previously proposed processes: (1) a shift of hemispheric dominance within the ventral attentional system, which would restore the ventral attentional input to the dorsal attentional system via the intact contralesional occipito-temporal and inferior parietal cortex [<xref rid="B57-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] or (2) an adjustment of the common reference frame for coordinated systems supported by parieto-cerebellar circuitry which serves to compensate for the failure of strategic setting of spatial parameters [<xref rid="B58-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The aims of the present study were to examine the hypotheses stated above through a systematic evaluation of the published fMRI studies and to refine the theoretical framework for PA and PAT. </p>

      <title>2. Materials and Methods</title>
      <p>We performed a scoping review and meta-analysis of the available literature on the neural bases of PA and PAT using fMRI. A PubMed search of “fMRI” and “prism adaptation” yielded a total of 50 published papers. We considered fMRI activation studies for cluster-based meta-analyses and resting state functional connectivity studies (rsFC) for qualitative review. The reason for excluding rsFC studies from the meta-analysis was that rsFC studies consider connectivity among pairs of brain regions or voxels, and thus, it was not possible to evaluate these studies using a cluster-based approach. Upon abstract review, 10 fMRI activation studies and 4 rsFC studies were selected. Following full text review, we eliminated 2 studies due to not having fMRI data or reviewing findings published elsewhere. Three additional fMRI studies were identified during the process of full text review. Each author conducted quality assessment of the included studies. </p>
      <p>A meta-analysis was performed on fMRI studies that shared common factors (e.g., participant population) if the number of studies was 2 or greater. For studies that did not meet this criterion, a comprehensive review of the studies was performed. We planned to conduct 4 cluster-based meta-analyses: (1) PA effects (pre-PA vs. post-PA) in healthy neurotypical participants (or healthy controls; HC), (2) PA effects in RBD patients, (3) PA mechanisms in HC using in-scanner PA, and (4) PA effects in LBD patients. In addition, we conducted 4 exploratory meta-analyses to study the neural correlates of PA separately for right deviating and left deviating prism goggles. A study could provide data in more than one category. Activation coordinates were extracted for each contrast related to prism exposure (pre &gt; post) and to different PA phases (early vs. late). Whenever coordinates were not available from a published paper, we reached out to the corresponding author and requested them. A full list of activation coordinates is provided in the <xref rid="app1-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials</xref>. All foci not already in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space were converted and submitted for analysis using the Brainmap GingerALE software version 3.0.2 [<xref rid="B59-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A voxelwise thresholding of activation likelihood maps using family wise error (FWE) rate of 0.01 and 1000 permutations were used.

The meta-analysis included 97 foci from 13 contrasts and 391 participants (125 unique individuals participating in repeated-measures experiments). The meta-analysis yielded no significant clusters that survived the strict corrected thresholds. As this meta-analysis included studies that used both left and right deviating prism goggles, we carried out two additional exploratory meta-analyses to determine if any clusters were activated after as compared to before PA differentially for rightward vs. leftward PA. No clusters reached significance at the specified cluster threshold. However, if the threshold was lowered to a minimal cluster size of 150 mm<sup>3</sup> and a FWE corrected <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 with 1000 permutations, we found that rightward PA was associated with an activation cluster in the left middle temporal gyrus with peak coordinates centered on x = −44, y = −66, z = 32, z = 5.25 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 FWE, cluster size = 168 mm<sup>3</sup>). This cluster was associated with an interaction of group (PA vs. control) and session (pre-PA vs. post-PA) and a contrast of post-PA &gt; pre-PA for right targets in a visual detection task. Similarly, for leftward PA, no clusters were significant at the chosen threshold. When we decreased the cluster threshold to 150 mm<sup>3</sup> and FWE corrected <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, two clusters became significant: a cluster in the right superior and middle temporal gyri (peak coordinates centered on x = 52, y = −58, z = 34, z = 5.72, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 FWE, cluster size = 264 mm<sup>3</sup>) and a cluster in the left anterior cerebellum (peak coordinates centered on x = −27, y = −48, z = −23, z = 5.72, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 FWE, cluster size = 160 mm<sup>3</sup>). The first cluster was associated with increased activation from pre- to post-PA to right stimuli in a visual detection task. The second cluster was linked with a decrease in activation post- compared to pre-PA to center and right stimuli in a visual detection task.</p>

This decrease was found in four right hemisphere clusters, including (1) posterior middle and inferior temporal gyri (MTG, ITG) extending to IOG and middle occipital gyrus (MOG), (2) temporal pole, (3) the insula, and (4) a small cluster in the angular gyrus. The study also included 14 HC, in whom PA produced an increase in IPL activation to right stimuli, and a decrease in temporal and prefrontal pole activation to center and right stimuli.

Studies employing seed-based functional connectivity analyses used bilateral intraparietal sulci (IPS), frontal eye fields (FEF), primary motor cortex (M1), cerebellum, left IPL, medial prefrontal cortex (<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>PFC), or anterior insula (<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>Ins) as seeds.

Conversely, connectivity of the frontal seeds with anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) transitively increased following PA. Increased connectivity was also found between bilateral M1 seeds. IPS also increased connectivity with bilateral IPL and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) following rightward PA. Thus, fronto-parietal connectivity decreased after PA, with one exception of increased IPS to IPL and MFG connectivity after rightward PA.

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>PAT is an effective treatment for functional disabilities induced by spatial neglect [<xref rid="B68-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, despite ample evidence for PAT effectiveness, about 25% of studies fail to show the beneficial effects of PAT on daily function in individual participants with spatial neglect [<xref rid="B17-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This conundrum is yet to be explained, as we do not fully understand the neural mechanisms underlying PAT responsiveness. Without such knowledge, our ability to maximize treatment effectiveness remains limited. In this review, we sought to elucidate the potential neuro-rehabilitative mechanisms of PAT by analyzing the currently available evidence for the neural mechanisms supporting PA. We employed qualitative and quantitative analytic approaches to determine what brain areas and brain networks become engaged before, during, and after PA, as evidenced by task-based and resting state fMRI studies in healthy adults and stroke patients with spatial neglect after unilateral brain damage. Our findings suggest that areas engaged during PA only partly overlap with areas that become more activated after PA. Moreover, the areas supporting PA effects among healthy controls differ from those among stroke patients, and the neural correlates of PA effects differ between RBD and LBD patients. While activity in most PA-supporting regions increases, rsFC among those regions predominantly decreases following PA. We review these findings below and conclude with a theoretical framework for interpreting these results in the context of what is known about oculomotor and attention networks.</p>

          <p>Across the five studies [<xref rid="B37-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B54-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B61-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] examined in Meta-Analysis 1 (<xref rid="brainsci-11-01468-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), areas that became engaged in visual detection after PA, compared to before PA, included IPL, superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri (STG, MTG, ITG), superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri (SFG, MFG, IFG), insula, ACC, orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortex (OFC, PFC), cerebellum, postcentral gyrus, precuneus, and the occipital cortex. None of these cluster peaks survived multiple comparison correction in the planned meta-analysis, even though these five studies came from the same research group and employed a similar task. </p>
          <p>One reason for the null result of Meta-Analysis 1 may be that the regions identified were engaged either unilaterally or bilaterally, and the laterality often differed depending on the direction of prism shift (leftward vs. rightward PA, one study), modality (visual detection vs. auditory detection, one study), or stimulus location (left, right, or center, five studies). When we separated the analyses into contrasts examining rightward vs. leftward PA, we again failed to find any significant clusters at the specified cluster threshold. However, with a less conservative threshold, we observed increased activation of the contralateral STG/MTG after PA and decreased left cerebellum activation after PA in leftward PA studies. Luauté et al. [<xref rid="B50-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] also observed activation of the STG/MTG associated with sustained PA when pointing errors were fully compensated and suggested that this activation is related to the generalization of spatial realignment to cognition rather than to PA per se. Chapman et al. [<xref rid="B51-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] found sustained activation of the cerebellum bilaterally throughout the PA process; however, in their study, a more posterior part of the cerebellum was activated on the left in the early and late phases of PA. The role of the cerebellum is discussed further in the context of Meta-Analysis 3 findings.</p>
          <p>Other factors that may have contributed to the heterogeneity of Meta-Analysis 1 results include a small number of participants for some of the studies reported (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> &lt; 15, three studies), suggesting that these studies may have only been powered to detect a two-way interaction between session (pre-PA and post-PA) and stimulus location (left, center, right) and not the main effect of the session. Different scanners, on which the data were collected, could have also contributed to the variability in the data. Lastly, the large number of brain regions found to be active in each study and included in the meta-analysis could have precluded any one region from being detected in the activation likelihood analysis. As the number of fMRI studies of PA grows in the future, it will become possible to subdivide these studies further into separate meta-analyses based on precise matches in methodology.</p>
          <p>In contrast to activation studies, rsFC studies [<xref rid="B56-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B65-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], based on a qualitative review, showed primarily a decrease in temporo-parietal, fronto-temporal, fronto-parietal, and parieto-cerebellar connectivity and an increase in parieto-limbic connectivity (transiently) and connectivity between bilateral motor seeds (<xref rid="brainsci-11-01468-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The global decreases in connectivity may be related to increased processing efficiency, which may or may not be specific to PA. Increased parieto-limbic (e.g., ACC) connectivity may be linked with increased arousal immediately following a PA session, which subsides 1 h after PA [<xref rid="B56-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Our review also highlighted whether the finding that increased interhemispheric motor connectivity was associated with the size of the PA after-effects [<xref rid="B65-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This result requires further research and the inclusion of behavioral covariates and additional control conditions. </p>

These areas include PPC, superior temporal cortex, and the cerebellum. While the superior temporal cortex is thought to support the transfer of PA effects to other cognitive domains as discussed earlier [<xref rid="B51-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], there is some disagreement between the studies with respect to the specific role that PPC and the cerebellum play in PA. For example, Luauté et al. [<xref rid="B50-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported that anterior IPL/IPS were engaged in the early phase of PA for recalibration, whereas cerebellum lobules IV and V were involved in the later phase of PA for the process of realignment. In contrast, Chapman et al. [<xref rid="B51-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] implicated right angular gyrus in realignment, and Küper et al. [<xref rid="B53-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] found that posterior cerebellum lobules VIII and IX were important for recalibration, whereas lobule VI was involved in realignment. Together, these studies had one thing in common: They had a relatively small number (&lt;25) of visuomotor movements during PA in the scanner as compared to studies having PA outside the scanner (&gt;50). As a result, the network of brain areas identified in these studies [<xref rid="B50-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B53-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B64-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] is likely weighted toward earlier prism exposure effects. Thus, the results of Meta-Analysis 3 suggest that in healthy adults, PPC and the cerebellum play significant roles during PA, potentially, the early phase of PA (<xref rid="brainsci-11-01468-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Specifically, among individuals who experience leftward PA (rightward after-effects), the mismatch between the visual input about target location and target-directed movement triggers rapid online correction of pointing errors and slower learning-based recalibration of visuomotor connectivity. Both processes are initially supported by the posterior cerebellum and involve cerebellar-parietal connectivity. Cerebellar activation subsides toward a later part of early PA, and recalibration is finalized through activity in the right IPL.</p>

Much less understood are the neural bases of recovery associated with PAT (e.g., a treatment course of multiple sessions of PA) or the lack of improved outcomes at the deficit or functional level. There are mixed results in studies using similar protocols, e.g., 20-diopter lenses, one session a day for 10 sessions over two weeks [<xref rid="B20-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B75-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Studies that doubled the sessions per day found positive effects in improving neglect [<xref rid="B76-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and rehabilitation outcomes [<xref rid="B19-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Other trials reduced the course duration, such as one session a day over 4 days [<xref rid="B77-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], or spaced out sessions, such as one to two sessions over 7–12 days [<xref rid="B78-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], and improvements were limited on some but not all neuropsychological tests. Nonetheless, there is no prospective study looking into the neural mechanisms underlying PAT effects after a different number of sessions. Thus, we remain unable to determine the neural bases of recovery associated with PAT. However, growing evidence using different brain imaging and stimulation techniques offers credible hypotheses. </p>
        <p>Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain why rightward PA is able to alleviate the dysfunctional behaviors in left-sided spatial neglect among RBD patients. One hypothesis stated that PA facilitates compensation through the contribution of the intact left hemisphere [<xref rid="B37-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The intact left IPL (part of the ventral attention system) receives input from the bilateral visual cortex. Following PA, hemispheric dominance within the ventral attention system is shifted to the left hemisphere (i.e., to the left rather than right IPL), which restores the input to bilateral dorsal attention system. This alleviates the pathological leftward orienting in spatial neglect [<xref rid="B37-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Consistent with this theory, cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the left posterior parietal cortex interfered with the beneficial effect of PA on spatial neglect [<xref rid="B79-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], while cortical thickness in left IPL and fusiform gyrus were positively associated with spatial neglect recovery after PA. Moreover, improvements of spatial neglect following 8 weeks of PAT were coupled with increased regional cerebral blood flow in parietal and pericallosal areas of the unaffected hemisphere [<xref rid="B80-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Seemingly inconsistent with this hypothesis are the results of the longitudinal study by Nyffeler et al. [<xref rid="B81-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] in RBD patients who were stimulated using theta-burst ‘inhibitory’ stimulation over the left parietal lobe with a generally positive response in clinical and neuropsychological symptoms of spatial neglect. This study suggests that inhibition of the left parietal cortex may be beneficial because it could restore putative transcallosal inhibition of the left by the right parietal cortex. However, given the importance of callosal integrity to this effect and, more generally, to spatial neglect recovery, Bartolomeo [<xref rid="B82-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] argued that this result is also consistent with an improvement of spatial neglect through facilitation of compensatory interhemispheric communication. The perturbation introduced by continuous theta-burst stimulation may cause functional interhemispheric connectivity to shift from a pathologically isolated state toward a hub-like state of higher interconnectivity. This further highlights that inhibitory/excitatory stimulation effects may work in complex ways within bi-hemispheric brain networks.</p>
        <p>The other hypothesis argued that spatial neglect represents a dysfunction of rapid calibration processes due to the abnormally reduced size of the task workspace where spatial attention is allocated [<xref rid="B58-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Engaging in PA adjusts the position, but not the size, of this task workspace through a process of alignment, which represents a modification in transformational constants that help to translate between different sensory-motor systems. While calibration, which is responsible for error correction in PA, is accomplished through associative learning and is based in the supratentorial brain, alignment, responsible for PA after-effects, is subserved by the cerebellum [<xref rid="B58-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Indeed, lesions in the cerebellum, along with those in the PPC, occipito-parietal, middle, and superior frontal cortex predict PA failure among spatial neglect patients [<xref rid="B38-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
        <p>Our finding in Meta-Analysis 2 showed that a cluster in the left inferior occipital/fusiform gyrus was more activated after than before PA in RBD patients (<xref rid="brainsci-11-01468-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) is in part consistent with the former hypothesis described above. Furthermore, this cluster was observed in studies that used visual search and line bisection tasks to index brain activity changes [<xref rid="B39-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B63-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and these tasks rely on visual processing. However, our results are inconsistent with either hypothesis, as we did not observe increased activation after PA in either the PPC or the cerebellum. While individual studies in this meta-analysis reported increases in IPL, SPL, SFG, MFG, and IFG, these increases were not consistent across studies, with either unilateral (left or right) or bilateral activity increases reported and only in some patient groups (frontal lesions patients as compared to parietal lesions patients). In contrast, all studies reported increased recruitment of bilateral occipital and fusiform cortex following PA. We propose that the main source of variability across these studies is likely the extent and location of stroke lesions given the small number of participants studied (N = 32 in the meta-analysis). The proportion of damage to the right inferior parietal area is also an important predictor of whether this area becomes recruited on the right or the left side of the brain. Future large-scale studies are needed to address these limitations.</p>
        <p>Only one study in our review looked at brain activity before and after leftward PA among LBD patients [<xref rid="B61-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and was excluded from meta-analyses. The study was conducted by Crottaz-Herbette et al. who had conducted several similar studies in HC [<xref rid="B37-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B54-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B61-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and one in RBD patients [<xref rid="B37-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While in LBD patients using leftward PA, primarily decreases of activity were observed in the right temporo-occipital and to some degree parietal areas to central and non-neglected left stimuli, in RBD patients using rightward PA, there were increases in the left temporo-parietal, bilateral occipital, and right frontal regions to stimuli located centrally or to either the left or right side. These findings are broadly consistent with the authors’ hypothesis that PA reverses right brain dominance in spatial attention [<xref rid="B57-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In neurotypical healthy participants, right IPL is dominant and subserves spatial processing for both left and right visual field. Following a unilateral stroke and PA, the left hemisphere IPL either becomes more active, or right IPL becomes less active.</p>

Direct multisynaptic pathways connect the cortex and superior colliculi and have a net excitatory effect through multiple sign-inverting pathways, where the basal ganglia disinhibit the collicular neurons and contribute to the selection of desired movements (i.e., cerebral cortex → + Striatum → − Substantia Nigra → − Superior Colliculi). Right superior colliculus activates extraocular muscles and the left upper cervical motoneurons, either directly or through the reticular activating system, which induces head movement to the left and captures the stimulus in central vision. Simultaneously, there is a decrease in activity of the right cervical motoneurons, which allows the leftward head movement [<xref rid="B40-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The cerebellum provides input to both the cortical and subcortical components of this network [<xref rid="B83-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Together with sensorimotor networks for visually and proprioceptively guided movements, this system affords for PA [<xref rid="B52-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. </p>
        <p>Our quantitative analyses of fMRI studies reinforce the key role of PPC and the cerebellum in the process of PA among healthy adults (Meta-Analysis 2) and the PA-induced reversal of right-brain dominance in visuospatial processing among RBD patients (Meta-Analysis 3). Our qualitative review of rsFC studies provides further insight into the modulating effects of PA. For example, one study reported interhemispheric connectivity changes between bilateral M1 seeds after PA, which were associated with the size of PA after-effects [<xref rid="B65-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This is likely related to the presence of excitatory intrahemispheric functional connectivity between the PPC and M1 [<xref rid="B84-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="B85-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Similarly, a tDCS study showed that stimulation of the left motor cortex led to an increase in the size and retention of PA after-effects [<xref rid="B86-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The authors of another study [<xref rid="B87-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] proposed that PA exerts its after-effects by inhibiting the PPC contralateral to the prism deviation. They showed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that PA altered interhemispheric inhibition of bilateral M1. The PA-induced inhibitory effect may modulate the inherent asymmetry between the left and right PPC [<xref rid="B88-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The right PPC inhibits the left PPC, while the left does not inhibit the right to the same extent [<xref rid="B88-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], which may account for a leftward bias in line bisection among some healthy adults (i.e., pseudoneglect) [<xref rid="B89-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] (see <xref rid="brainsci-11-01468-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> panel 1). After a healthy individual adapts to leftward-PA and takes the prisms off, the net effect is reduced activity to visual targets in the right IPL, which disinhibits the left IPL. When asked to reach to a visual target, the excitatory connectivity between left IPL and M1 is enhanced due to the left IPL being disinhibited, and this also changes the bilateral M1 connectivity, which is proportionate to the strength of PA and the degree of left IPL disinhibition [<xref rid="B65-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B87-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] (see <xref rid="brainsci-11-01468-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> panel 2). As a result, rightward after-effects as measured using arm-reaching pointing tasks are observed. The opposite prism shift may not trigger these processes to the same degree because transcallosal inhibitory effects in the PPC are asymmetric [<xref rid="B88-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="B90-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Thus, the right-to-left inhibition in PPC is maintained following rightward PA, and this frequently leads to an absence of any pointing after-effects in healthy adults [<xref rid="B87-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="B90-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] (see <xref rid="brainsci-11-01468-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> panel 3). </p>
        <p>However, after RBD, the right-to-left inhibition in PPC would be disrupted, and the PA mechanisms are supported by different circuits, which likely depend on lesion location [<xref rid="B39-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In RBD patients with left-sided spatial neglect, rightward PA leads to leftward after-effects. Although rightward PA would normally inhibit the left IPL [<xref rid="B88-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], in stroke patients, instead, it appears that the left hemisphere becomes more engaged. Some studies suggest that left parietal cortex subsumes dominance in spatial processing. Our meta-analysis suggests that greater left hemisphere recruitment following PA may involve the visual cortex, in particular, when behavioral tasks used to measure the effects of PA involve visual processing (<xref rid="brainsci-11-01468-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> panel 4). Thus, it is possible that in stroke patients, both sensorimotor realignment [<xref rid="B58-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] (observed in HC, Meta-Analysis 3) and redistribution of hemispheric dominance [<xref rid="B57-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] (Meta-Analysis 2) may take place at different phases of PA.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Based on our review and analyses of the available fMRI evidence about the neural mechanism of PA, healthy adults and individuals with spatial neglect after unilateral stroke adapt to prismatic exposure differently. In healthy adults, PA is carried out through cerebellar-parietal activation, which in turn affects the interhemispheric balance of activity in occipital, posterior parietal, and frontal primary motor areas. Patients with unilateral brain damage may rely on the intact hemisphere during PA; however, more studies are needed to clarify the contribution of lesion location and load on the circuits involved in PA. Similarly, future studies are needed to investigate the relationship of decreasing rsFC to visuomotor function. </p>

(2018) [<xref rid="B87-brainsci-11-01468" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] and in RBD patients (<bold>4</bold>). Inhibitory connections are shown in red; excitatory connections are shown in green. Under normal vision, right PPC inhibits the left. PA inhibits contralateral PPC. Following left PA, right PPC is inhibited, which disinhibits the left PPC and propagates activation to left M1, which in turn increases the inhibition of right M1. Following right PA, the inhibition of left PPC by right PPC is maintained. Following RBD, inhibition of left by right PPC is disrupted, the inhibition of left PPC by right PA is mediated by the left visual cortex, left PPC subsumes dominance in spatial orienting. M1—primary motor cortex, PPC—posterior parietal cortex, LG—lingual gyrus.</p>
