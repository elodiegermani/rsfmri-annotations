"Schintu et al., 2020 [???]",HC,38(18 used rightward prisms; 20 used leftward prisms),15° rightward or leftward150 concurrent finger pointing movements to right and left visual targets verbally cued in pseudorandom order,Looking at a white central cross appearing on a black screen for an unspecified period of time,"R ight vs. left PA in decreasing rsFC between IPS seeds and …Right PA: ➢A cluster of right parahippocampal, fusiform and lingual gyri, and Thal➢Left and right CBMLeft PA: No effect survived FDR correction After vs. before PA in rsFC between IPS seeds and …Right PA ➢Bilateral (decreased): STG➢Bilateral (increased): IPL➢Right (increased): MFGLeft PA ➢Bilateral (decreased): STG➢Right (decreased): MFG, SPL➢Left (decreased): IPL",Strength:Adequate sample size; direct comparison of left vs. right PAWeakness:Connectivity analyses only examined two seeds
"Tsujimoto et al., 2019 [???]",HC,19,"11.4° rightward (using 20-diopter prism lenses)90 terminal finger pointing movements to central, right, and left visual targets randomized on a monitor screen",10 min with unspecified instructions,Immediately after PA vs. before in rsFC between FEF and … ➢Right (decreased): IPS➢Right (increased): ACCOne hour after PA vs. immediate after PA in rsFC between FEF and … ➢Right (increased): IPS➢Right (decreased): ACC,"Strength:Second fMRI, one hour after PA, allowed evaluating the duration of connectivity changesWeakness:Narrow field of view (four slices)Analyses limited to connectivity between specific, pre-determined seedsInstructions to participants in scanner were not described"
