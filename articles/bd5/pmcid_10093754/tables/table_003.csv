8,Anwar et al. (2022) [???],"Parietal, temporal, frontal,intra-ventricular, occipital, fronto-parietal",Pre-operative fMRI of eloquentbrain areas depicted for surgical planning,"SMN was identified in all PT, followed byDMN, and LAN. FC maps of the SMN extracted by SBA were more extensive.","9 patients presented with signs of increased ICT but 8resolved 3 months post-operative. 10 patients presented with neurological deficits: 1 deceased. 3 months post-operative, improvement in 6 patients, stationary course in 2 patients, 1 showed worsening scale, 1 presented a mass (Ewing Sarcoma)",Rs-fMRI is a promising toolfor localising different functional brain networks in pre-operative assessments of brain areas
