Area,Keyword,Recommendation
Methodological,Parcellations,Test different parcellation schemes and atlases
Methodological,Parcellations,Test different node resolutions to explore stability of effects (currently only for Schaefer atlas possible)
Methodological,"Preprocessing, denoising",Optimize preprocessing and denoising strategies to different types of functional connectivity indices
Methodological,"Preprocessing, denoising",Test influence of different denoising pipelines to identify possible relationship between motion and measure of interest
Methodological,"Preprocessing, denoising",Exclude high motion subjects (rather strict than lenient if amount of data allows for)
Methodological,"Sliding window technique, dynamic functional connectivity","Test different windowing schemes (e.g., size of windows, amount of overlap)"
Methodological,"Sliding window technique, dynamic functional connectivity","Use sufficient amount of data, if possible, e.g., via multiband fMRI (but take into account that acceleration decreases signal-to-noise ratio) or longer measurements"
Methodological,Multilayer modularity,Test different parameter settings
Psychological,Construct of interest,"Incorporate different measures for (e.g., two resilience scales) or aim for a complete characterization (i.e., all possible metrics) for the construct of interest, if possible"
Psychological,Brain: construct of interest relationship/confounding variables,Motivate in/exclusion of covariates (test both if applicable)
Psychological,Brain: construct of interest relationship/confounding variables,Provide descriptive statistics for measures of interest
Psychological,Brain: construct of interest relationship/confounding variables,Provide reliability measures (if applicable)
Replications,Method section,Provide enough detail to allow for replication attempts
