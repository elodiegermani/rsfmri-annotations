Pediatric neuroradiologist at Boston Children's Hospital reviewed both pre-treatment (at 1-month corrected age) and post-treatment (at 2.25-months corrected age) brain MRI scans for clinically relevant findings. Table\u00a0summarizes neuroradiological findings that included characterization of cerebrospinal fluid, brain parenchyma, tracts, and incidental findings of clinical significance. Note prominent extra-axial space on pre-treatment scan usually associated with prematurity, improvement of myelination maturation with time, as well as a novel incidental finding of bilateral subdural fluid collections on post-treatment scan. Corrected age at scan was calculated as follows: postnatal age (weeks) \u2013 [40 \u2013 gestational age at birth (weeks)].", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_000.csv"}
