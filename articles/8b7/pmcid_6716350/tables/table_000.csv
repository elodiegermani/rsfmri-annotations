Pre-treatment,1.0,•Prominence of extra-axial spaces overlying cerebral hemispheres.,•Under opercularization of the Sylvian fissures.,•Mild heterogeneity of cerebral white matter.
,,"•No hydrocephalus, ventriculomegaly or subdural fluid collections noted.",,
Post-treatment,2.25,•Novel finding of bilateral subdural fluid collections along frontal convexities (7 mm L > 5 mm R) with mild mass effect on the L side consistent with chronic subdural hematomas. No midline shift.,•Continued prominence of Sylvian fissures.,•Myelination progressed and considered age-appropriate.
,,•Ventricular system normal in size.,,
