Population size,N (area- and population-specific)
Connectivity,Connectivity
Type,source and target neurons drawn randomly with replacement (allowing autapses and multapses) with area- and population-specific connection probabilities
Weights,"fixed, drawn from normal distribution with mean J such that postsynaptic potentials have a mean amplitude of 0.15 mV and standard deviation δJ = 0.1J; 4E to 2/3E increased by factor 2 [???]; weights of inhibitory connections increased by factor g; excitatory weights <0 and inhibitory weights >0 are redrawn; cortico-cortical weights onto excitatory and inhibitory populations increased by factor χ and χIχ, respectively"
Delays,"fixed, drawn from Gaussian distribution with mean d and standard deviation δd = 0.5d; delays of inhibitory connections factor 2 smaller; delays rounded to the nearest multiple of the simulation step size h = 0.1 ms, inter-area delays drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean d = s/vt, with distance s and transmission speed vt = 3.5 m/s [???]; and standard deviation δd = d/2, distances determined as the median of the distances between all vertex pairs of the two areas in their surface representation in F99 space, a standard macaque cortical surface included with Caret [???], where the vertex-to-vertex distance is the length of the shortest possible path without crossing the cortical surface [???] (see [???]), delays < 0.1 ms before rounding are redrawn"
