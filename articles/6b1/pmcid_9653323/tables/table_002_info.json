The model included the following main predictors: time (a positive effect means that, longitudinally, the neuropsychological measure increases regardless of tumor grade and lateralization), time\u2009\u00d7\u2009tumor grade interaction (a positive effect means that, longitudinally, the neuropsychological measure increases faster in LGG relative to HGG, regardless of lateralization) and time\u2009\u00d7\u2009tumor lateralization (positive means that, longitudinally, the neuropsychological measure in left-lateralized glioma increases faster than in right-lateralized glioma, regardless of tumor grade). The model was adjusted by age, sex, baseline tumor volume, IDH mutation, tumor methylation, and tumor WHO grade as nuisance variables. Significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) fixed effects are emphasized in bold with their respective effect size and an asterisk if the effect survives FDR correction across different models of the same cognitive domain", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_002.csv"}
