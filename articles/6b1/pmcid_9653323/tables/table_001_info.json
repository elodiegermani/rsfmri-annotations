{"table_id": "Tab2", "table_label": "Table 2", "table_caption": "Functional connectivity profile showing significant effects revealed by a linear mixed model of longitudinal changes (baseline, 1\u20133-, 3\u20136-, 6\u20139-, 9\u201315-month follow-ups) in brain tumor patients stratified into two groups (low-grade gliomas (LGG) correspond to gliomas treated with only surgical resection, while high-grade gliomas (HGG) correspond to gliomas treated with surgical resection in combination with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). The model included the following main predictors: time (a positive effect means longitudinal connectivity increases regardless of tumor grade and lateralization), time\u2009\u00d7tumor grade interaction (a positive effect means that longitudinal connectivity increases faster in LGG relative to HGG, regardless of lateralization) and time\u2009\u00d7tumor lateralization (positive means that longitudinal connectivity in left-lateralized glioma increases faster than in right-lateralized glioma, regardless of tumor grade). The model was adjusted with age, sex, baseline tumor volume, IDH mutation, tumor methylation, and tumor WHO grade as nuisance variables. Significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) fixed effects are emphasized in bold with their respective effect sizes and an asterisk if the effect survives FDR correction across different models", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_001.csv"}
