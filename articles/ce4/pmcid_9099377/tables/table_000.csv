Public title,Effect of cerebellar vermis iTBS on the balance dysfunction of stroke patients and the brain remodeling mechanism
Scientific title,Effect of cerebellar vermis iTBS on the balance dysfunction of stroke patients and the brain remodeling mechanism
Countries of recruitment,China
Healthy conditions(s) or problem(s) studied,"Stroke with hemiparesis, including balance dysfunction"
Intervention(s),"Active comparator: iTBS (application of 600 pulses with a frequency of 50 Hz, in a theta-rhythm of 5 Hz for 200 s) will be applied to the cerebellum vermis positioned tangentially to the scalp combined with routine rehabilitation treatment. Sham comparator: Sham stimulus will be applied to same location with a customized sham coil, also combined with routine rehabilitation treatment."
Key inclusion and exclusion criteria,"Inclusion criteria: (a) have a diagnosis of stroke confirmed by CT and/or MRI, (b) have their first-ever unilateral ischemic stroke between 1 and 6 months of onset, (c) are 40–75 years old, (d) presented with a balance dysfunction with a Berg score between 0 and 40, (e) can follow simple verbal commands or instructions, and (f) can cooperate in signing informed consent forms. Exclusion criteria: (a) with contraindications involving TMS and fMRI (e.g., intracranial implant, cardiac pacemaker, implanted drug pumps, and pregnancy), (b) with cerebellum or brainstem stroke, (c) with balance dysfunction before stroke, (d) with serious diseases that may contribute to condition progression, (e) with severe deficits in communication or executing commands that prevent cooperation with assessment and treatment, (f) who are taking psychotropic drugs, and (g) who are currently enrolled in other clinical trials."
