        <p id="P2">Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of premature mortality among people with epilepsy. Evidence from witnessed and monitored SUDEP cases indicate seizure-induced cardiovascular and respiratory failures; yet, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. SUDEP occurs often during the night and early morning hours, suggesting that sleep or circadian rhythm-induced changes in physiology contribute to the fatal event. Resting-state fMRI studies have found altered functional connectivity between brain structures involved in cardiorespiratory regulation in later SUDEP cases and in individuals at high-risk of SUDEP. However, those connectivity findings have not been related to changes in cardiovascular or respiratory patterns. Here, we compared fMRI patterns of brain connectivity associated with regular and irregular cardiorespiratory rhythms in SUDEP cases with those of living epilepsy patients of varying SUDEP risk, and healthy controls. We analysed resting-state fMRI data from 98 patients with epilepsy (9 who subsequently succumbed to SUDEP, 43 categorized as low SUDEP risk (no tonic-clonic seizures (TCS) in the year preceding the fMRI scan), and 46 as high SUDEP risk (&gt;3 TCS in the year preceding the scan)) and 25 healthy controls. The global signal amplitude (GSA), defined as the moving standard deviation of the fMRI global signal, was used to identify periods with regular (‘low state’) and irregular (‘high state’) cardiorespiratory rhythms. Correlation maps were derived from seeds in twelve regions with a key role in autonomic or respiratory regulation, for the low and high states. Following principal component analysis, component weights were compared between the groups. We found widespread alterations in connectivity of precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex in epilepsy compared to controls, in the low state (regular cardiorespiratory activity). In the low state, and to a lesser degree in the high state, reduced anterior insula connectivity (mainly with anterior and posterior cingulate cortex) in epilepsy appeared, relative to healthy controls. For SUDEP cases, the insula connectivity differences were inversely related to the interval between the fMRI scan and death. The findings suggest that anterior insula connectivity measures may provide a biomarker of SUDEP risk. The neural correlates of autonomic brain structures associated with different cardiorespiratory rhythms may shed light on the mechanisms underlying terminal apnea observed in SUDEP.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P3">Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of premature death in patients with intractable epilepsy, with an annual incidence estimated at approximately 1.2 per 1,000 persons with epilepsy (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Sveinsson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Thurman et al., 2017</xref>). SUDEP is defined as ‘the sudden, unexpected, witnessed or unwitnessed, nontraumatic and nondrowning death in patients with epilepsy, with or without evidence for a seizure and excluding documented status epilepticus, in which postmortem examination does not reveal a structural or toxicologic cause for death’ (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Nashef et al., 2012</xref>). SUDEP imposes a substantial public health burden (<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Thurman et al., 2017</xref>) and, among neurological disorders, ranks second only to stroke in terms of potential years of life lost (<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Thurman et al., 2014</xref>). Frequent generalized and focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (TCS; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>) are the greatest risk factors. Sleep and nocturnal TCS appear to facilitate SUDEP (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Ryvlin et al., 2013</xref>). The pathophysiology of SUDEP remains poorly understood (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Devinsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Sveinsson et al., 2020</xref>), and seizure control is considered the most effective strategy for reducing risk of the fatal outcome. However, currently, strategies for assessing SUDEP risk on an individual basis are still lacking.</p>
      <p id="P4">Epilepsy monitoring unit data from the MORTEMUS study (MORTality in Epilepsy Monitoring Unit Study) suggest that SUDEP results from cardiorespiratory dysfunction induced by TCS (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Ryvlin et al., 2013</xref>). <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Vilella et al. (2019)</xref> found that post-ictal central apnea occurs in one out of five TCS and was present in near-SUDEP and SUDEP cases, suggesting that cessation of breathing may represent an important SUDEP biomarker. Cardiovascular parameters may also provide markers; heart rate and its variability, measured in the peri-ictal period (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic> post-ictal mean heart rate; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Arbune et al., 2020</xref>), are associated with markers of seizure severity that have been linked to SUDEP such as the presence of TCS and the duration of post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES). However, although some patients succumb to SUDEP after a few seizures, others survive hundreds of similar attacks, which suggests the presence of additional pathophysiological mechanisms in SUDEP victims (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Devinsky and Sisodiya, 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, reduced interictal heart rate variability (HRV) measured during wakefulness has also been associated with SUDEP (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">DeGiorgio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Sivathamboo et al., 2021</xref>), raising the possibility of chronic impairment in autonomic regulation in SUDEP. Further evidence of the role of chronic dysregulation is provided by the recent observation of abnormal heart rate responses during and after hyperventilation in patients who subsequently died of SUDEP (<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Szurhaj et al., 2021</xref>), and of volume changes in brain regions with key roles in autonomic regulation (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P5">Functional MRI (fMRI) is a non-invasive neuroimaging tool that can evaluate functional connectivity (FC) between brain structures at a whole-brain level. Early fMRI studies focusing on FC revealed altered connectivity of regions involved in cardiorespiratory regulation such as the anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus and regions of the brainstem in SUDEP cases and patients at high risk of SUDEP (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2019a</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2014</xref>). These studies, however, did not take into consideration the time-varying nature of FC observed on the scale of seconds to minutes, which is believed to provide a more holistic understanding of the brain functional organization (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Glover, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Preti et al., 2017</xref>). There is accumulating evidence that FC dynamics change with different autonomic and sleep states (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Haimovici et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, examining the changes in FC occurring in different dynamic patterns of breathing or cardiovascular action, such as those that appear during different sleep states or other provocations, may reveal new insights into mechanisms that contribute to SUDEP different from those FC values obtained in static physiological conditions.</p>
      <p id="P6">In addition to the apparent role of sleep and nocturnal TCS, recent observations suggest that more attention on the state-dependent nature of autonomic manifestations is warranted. A recent study suggests a stronger association between SUDEP and post-ictal rather than ictal central apnea (<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Vilella et al., 2019</xref>); whereas, another study found abnormally low HRV in SUDEP during wakefulness, but not during sleep (<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Sivathamboo et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the examination of the state-dependent nature of autonomic manifestations using resting-state fMRI seems promising. In particular, the observation that subjects that exhibit strong fluctuations in heart rate and breathing patterns during an fMRI scan are also characterized by an elevated global signal amplitude (GSA), which refers to strong BOLD fMRI fluctuations globally in the brain (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Orban et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Xifra-Porxas et al., 2021</xref>), may be a key to better understanding the physiology of SUDEP.</p>
      <p id="P7">In this work, we sought to characterize the patterns of FC in patients who eventually succumbed to SUDEP, living patients of varying SUDEP risk levels, and healthy controls, with regards to variations in the regularity of cardiorespiratory rhythms. First, we use a publicly available fMRI dataset (<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Van Essen et al., 2013</xref>) with concurrent physiological recordings to demonstrate that the association of GSA with cardiac and breathing rhythms holds even within short fMRI scans (~15 min), with periods of high GSA corresponding to times with irregularities in cardiac or breathing activity such as periods with transient apnea. Second, we characterize patterns of FC in SUDEP cases and epilepsy patients alive at the time of this analysis by employing a state-dependent framework and GSA as a surrogate of the state of autonomic activity. Moreover, given the well-documented success of FC measures in predicting symptom severity in individuals for a range of disorders (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Uddin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Yoo et al., 2018</xref>), we also investigate whether FC measures in SUDEP cases are associated with the interval between the fMRI scan and SUDEP occurrence.</p>

      <p id="P8">The principal aim was to study the link between brain connectivity and autonomic activity in patients with epilepsy using a large resting-state fMRI dataset that did not comprise physiological recordings. This study consists of two experiments: In the first experiment (Experiment 1), we employed a set of resting-state fMRI data that included concurrent recordings from a photoplethysmograph (PPG) and a respiratory belt, to demonstrate that global signal amplitude (GSA) fluctuations reflect changes in cardiorespiratory activity. Previous studies have defined GSA as the standard deviation of the global signal across the entire scan (<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and showed that GSA is linked to physiological parameters (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Orban et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we compute GSA over significantly shorter durations, using the sliding window approach, in order to illustrate that the relationship of GSA with physiological parameters also holds at shorter timescales. Experiment 2 consisted of the characterization of the patterns of FC in patients with epilepsy using GSA as a marker of breathing and cardiac irregularities.</p>

        <title>Experiment 1: Association of fMRI global signal amplitude with variations in cardiorespiratory rhythms (HCP data)</title>
        <p id="P9">To demonstrate that the global signal amplitude is linked to cardiorespiratory activity, we examined resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP; <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Van Essen et al., 2013</xref>) that included concurrent recordings from a photoplethysmograph (PPG) and a respiratory belt. A description of the preprocessing pipeline for the HCP dataset can be found in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material</xref>. Data from a subset of 400 healthy young participants that was characterized by good-quality physiological recordings were included. The global signal, defined as the mean fMRI time-series averaged across all voxels in the grey matter, was computed from the fMRI data after volume realignment and high-pass filtering (0.008 Hz). Subsequently, the global signal amplitude (GSA), defined as the standard deviation of the global signal, was computed in a sliding window manner for window lengths ranging from 10 to 120 sec (or equivalently, 14 to 167 time points) using the Matlab function <italic toggle="yes">movstd</italic>. A one-sample shift was applied between consecutive windows, and the standard deviation computed within a window was assigned to the center of the window in terms of time. In addition, the following four variables were obtained from the physiological recordings: (1) breathing rate; (2) respiration volume as defined in Chang et al. (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; i.e. moving standard deviation of respiratory signal with a window length of six seconds); (3) heart rate; and (4) PPG amplitude defined as the amplitude of the oscillatory signal in the PPG (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Kassinopoulos and Mitsis, 2021</xref>). Subsequently, the moving standard deviation of the physiological variables was also estimated for window lengths ranging from 10 to 120 sec. Then, for each window length, the correlation of the GSA with each of the four physiological variables was computed and averaged across all individuals, in order to find the length that maximizes the correlation without sacrificing temporal resolution.</p>

          <p id="P10">We retrospectively ascertained cases of SUDEP, and high- and low-risk patients from the University College London Hospitals (UCLH) clinical database that had undergone an EEG-fMRI scan in the period between 2005 and 2015 (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Coan et al., 2016</xref>). The inclusion criteria were: (1) the availability of a resting-state EEG-fMRI scan; and (2) a high-resolution T<sub>1</sub>-weighted scan. The exclusion criteria were: (1) large brain lesion or previous neurosurgery (we considered large to be anything similar to or greater than a small area of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) or hippocampal sclerosis – e.g. tumours, cavernomas); (2) incomplete clinical or imaging data (e.g. abandoned scans); and (3) having died in the following years with a cause of death not related to SUDEP. Only patients alive at the time of writing were considered as low-risk or high-risk epilepsy controls.</p>
          <p id="P11">Out of a cohort of 189 patients who underwent resting-state EEG-fMRI, 14 deaths were identified in the UCLH clinical database, of which 10 were classified as SUDEP based on their death certificate. One SUDEP case was excluded due to the presence of a large brain lesion. The remaining 9 SUDEP cases (5 females, mean age 26.2 ± 6.2) were classified as either probable or definite SUDEP based on the definitions proposed in <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Nashef et al. (2012)</xref>. The 9 examined SUDEP cases were matched with 43 low-risk, 46 high-risk patients and 25 healthy controls based on sex and age at the time of scan. High-risk patients were considered those that experienced more than 3 TCS in the year preceding the scan and low-risk patients were considered those that did not experience TCS. Group demographics and clinical details are shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Table 1</xref>. The study was approved by our local Research Ethics Committee and all patients gave written informed consent.</p>

          <p id="P12">Scanning was performed at the Epilepsy Society (Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, UK) on a 3.0 Tesla GE (Signa excite HDX) scanner. A 20-min (400 vol) T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted fMRI scan was collected from each subject except for two patients that were scanned for 10-min instead. The fMRI scan was done using a gradient-echo echo-planar-imaging with the following characteristics: repetition time (TR) = 3000 ms, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, matrix size = 64 × 64, field of view (FOV) = 24 × 24 cm<sup>2</sup>, slice thickness = 2.4 mm with 0.6 mm gap, 44 slices, and voxel size = 3.75 × 3.75 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>. Subjects were instructed to keep their eyes closed, avoid falling asleep, and not think about anything in particular. A T<sub>1</sub>-weighted image was also acquired using a FSPGR (fast spoiled gradient recalled echo) sequence, with the following parameters: matrix size = 256 × 256, FOV = 24 × 24 cm<sup>2</sup>, slice thickness = 1.5 mm, 150 slices, and voxel size = 0.94 × 0.94 × 1.5 mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
          <p id="P13">Scalp EEG signals and an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal were simultaneously acquired during fMRI scanning at 5 kHz using a 64-channel MR-compatible EEG system with a cap comprising ring Ag/AgCl electrodes (BrainAmp MR+; Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany). The electrodes were placed according to the 10/20 system and referenced to electrode FCz.</p>

<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Friston et al., 2007</xref>) in a Matlab environment (R2020a; Mathworks, Natic, Massachusetts, USA). The first five functional volumes were discarded to allow steady-state magnetization to be established and the remaining volumes were realigned to correct for head movements. The structural image of each subject was co-registered to the mean realigned functional volume and, subsequently, underwent tissue segmentation into grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid tissue compartments. The functional images, as well as the coregistered structural images and tissue compartment masks, were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space using non-linear transformation.</p>
          <p id="P15">To account for anatomical variability across participants and reduce thermal noise, all individual functional volumes were smoothed using a 5 mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. The fMRI time-series were high-passed at 0.008 Hz to avoid spurious correlations that arise from low-frequency fluctuations (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Leonardi and Van De Ville, 2015</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P16">We used the frame-wise displacement (FD) introduced by <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Salek-Haddadi et al. (2006)</xref>, implemented here as calculated in <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Power et al. (2012)</xref>, to identify and exclude subjects with high levels of motion as motion has been shown to lead to systematic biases in FC studies (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Kassinopoulos and Mitsis, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Savva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Xifra-Porxas et al., 2021</xref>). FD is calculated from the six motion realignment parameters, and reflects the extent of scan-to-scan head motion at each time point. Subjects that were characterized by mean FD larger than 0.25 mm were excluded. For the datasets included in this study, time points with FD larger than 0.2 mm were considered outliers and corrected by linear interpolation.</p>
          <p id="P17">Finally, to further mitigate the effects of motion and reduce the effects of physiological processes and scanner artifacts, we regressed out the following nuisance effects from all voxel time-series: the first 10 principal components extracted from all white matter voxel time-series (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Behzadi et al., 2007</xref>), 6 regressors related to cardiac pulsatility artifacts obtained with the convolution model proposed in <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Kassinopoulos &amp; Mitsis (2021)</xref> in conjunction with the R-waves detected in the ECG, and the mean fMRI time-series averaged across all voxels within the grey matter (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Macey et al., 2004</xref>). The mean grey matter signal was considered a nuisance regressor, as there is accumulating evidence that it reflects changes in heart rate and breathing patterns (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kassinopoulos and Mitsis, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Xifra-Porxas et al., 2021</xref>). Note that although GSA, which is used in this study to probe regularities in cardiorespiratory activity, is derived from the grey matter signal, the two aforementioned signals are weakly correlated, with a group average correlation of −0.05 (± 0.25) (for a GSA estimation with a sliding window length of 80 sec).</p>

          <title>Seed-based connectivity and spatial distribution pattern analysis</title>
          <p id="P18">A seed-based FC analysis was employed with seeds consisting of regions with a key role in autonomic and respiratory regulation (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Benarroch, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Critchley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Lacuey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Valenza et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, the seeds consisted of the mean time-series of voxels within the following 12 regions: anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, posterior insula, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCu/PCC), cuneus, caudate, putamen and Brodmann area 25. The aforementioned regions were defined based on parcels (i.e. non-overlapping contiguous regions) from the Brainnetome atlas (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P19">As in Exp. 1, the global signal used to derive GSA was computed as the mean time-series averaged across all voxels in the grey matter, after volume realignment and high-pass filtering (0.008 Hz), and before regressing out nuisance regressors. A window length of 80 sec was used to derive the GSA, as this length was found in Exp. 1 to yield a strong association between the GSA and the physiological variables, while also preserving an adequate temporal resolution (see <xref rid="S12" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>, <xref rid="S13" ref-type="sec">Section 3.1</xref>). Time points that corresponded to the lowest and highest quartile of the GSA trace were assigned to the low and high state, where the low and high states indicate, respectively, times with regular (stable) and irregular (unstable) cardiorespiratory rhythms (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Time points that corresponded to the second and third quartile were discarded from the analysis.</p>
          <p id="P20">The fMRI time-series derived for each seed was correlated with all regions in the grey matter on a voxel-wise basis (Pearson correlation), considering the low and high states, separately. Time points that corresponded to the low state were concatenated before computing the Pearson correlation between seed and voxel timeseries. Likewise, time points in the high state were concatenated before computing the Pearson correlation. The correlation values were then converted into z-scores using Fisher’s transform (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). For each seed, the correlation maps were vectorized and concatenated across subjects and states, resulting in a two-dimensional matrix where rows represent subjects and states (e.g. a row may correspond to subject <italic toggle="yes">j</italic> in the low state), and columns correspond to voxels. Finally, the resulting matrix was decomposed through principal component analysis (PCA) to generate a set of FC patterns, also known as eigenconnectivities (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Leonardi et al., 2013</xref>), and a set of weights reflecting the degree to which a subject expresses each of the FC patterns in a given state (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). To reduce the number of tests, the subsequent analysis was restricted to the components explaining the highest fraction of variance with a 90% of cumulative variance.</p>

        <title>Experiment 1: Association of fMRI global signal amplitude with variations in cardiorespiratory rhythms (HCP data)</title>
        <p id="P23">We found the GSA to be strongly correlated with the standard deviation of each of the four examined physiological variables (breathing rate, respiration volume, heart rate and PPG amplitude; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>) in the HCP data (<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Van Essen et al., 2013</xref>). The strongest association was observed for respiration volume; furthermore, increasing the window length from 20 to 80 sec led to a significant increase of the correlation from 0.29 (±0.02) to 0.53 (±0.03) which remained at similar levels for longer lengths. A window length of approximately 80 sec was also found to increase the correlation of GSA with breathing rate (0.34±0.03) and PPG amplitude (0.30±0.03). <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows the breathing-related and fMRI signals for a subject where the levels of GSA co-fluctuate with variations in respiration volume. For instance, we observe that periods with strong fluctuations in respiration volume (e.g. 200–500 sec) were characterized by higher levels of GSA as compared to periods with a regular breathing activity (e.g. 500–600 sec). Finally, we note that while a similar association of GSA with respiration volume was observed, for several subjects, high levels of GSA often corresponded to periods with transient apnea (i.e. brief pauses of breathing activity; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Fig. 2A</xref>), transient increase in heart rate (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl.

Therefore, GSA is strongly driven by variations in cardiovascular and breathing activity, although it cannot distinguish the former from the latter.</p>

The anterior insula was found to be positively correlated with the anterior cingulate cortex, regions of the middle frontal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobe and posterior insula, and negatively correlated with the posterior cingulate cortex, and regions of the middle temporal gyrus and frontal gyrus. The FC pattern of component #3 that was found to be the most discriminant principal component of anterior insula, exhibited positive weights in the posterior cingulate cortex, and regions of the middle temporal gyrus and frontal gyrus, and negative weights in the anterior cingulate cortex, and anterior and posterior insula (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P28">It can be seen that the FC pattern #3 of anterior insula is to a large degree the inverse of the anterior insula seed-based correlation map, and thus a positive weight for the involvement of this pattern on a subject can be interpreted as decline in anterior insula connectivity as compared to the mean connectivity observed in the entire cohort. In other words, both positive and negative correlation values of the anterior insula’s connectivity, with the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices respectively, are weaker. Similarly, a negative weight of FC pattern #3 for within-subject involvement indicates stronger anterior insula connections with respect to the mean connectivity.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P32">This study utilized resting-state fMRI data to examine FC in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who subsequently died of SUDEP. Given the strong link between time-varying FC and variations in autonomic activity (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Mulcahy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Nikolaou et al., 2016</xref>), particular attention was placed on characterizing connectivity in periods with regular and irregular cardiorespiratory activity, separately. We also wanted to examine whether any of the observed effects is linked to the risk for SUDEP.</p>
      <p id="P33">We first demonstrated that the moving standard deviation of fMRI global signal, termed here global signal amplitude (GSA), is elevated at periods with strong fluctuations in breathing and cardiac activity (Experiment 1) using data in the public domain. Specifically, we showed that GSA is elevated during periods of the order of 1 minute that present at least one of the following features: a transient apnea, variations in respiratory volume, transient increases in heart rate or variations in the amplitude of the PPG (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>); In this work, such periods correspond to a ‘high GSA state’. Our study extends previous findings by demonstrating that the association of GSA and variations in cardiorespiratory rhythms previously found across subjects and fMRI runs (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kassinopoulos and Mitsis, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Orban et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2017</xref>), is also present within a run at the scale of minutes. This finding indicates that previously-collected fMRI datasets that did not include monitoring of physiological processes could be revisited to study aspects of the autonomic nervous system. This outcome is particularly relevant for fMRI studies examining rare diseases and phenomena with a low incidence rate such as SUDEP.</p>
      <p id="P34">Subsequently, we characterized FC in 9 SUDEP cases as compared to healthy participants, and patients (alive at the time of this analysis) classified as either at low or high risk of SUDEP based on the frequency of TCS (Experiment 2). Resting-state fMRI scans of 20 minute duration from each subject were considered for connectivity assessment in the ‘low GSA state’ and ‘high GSA state’. Seed-based connectivity analysis was employed focusing on twelve brain structures with a key role in autonomic and respiratory regulation. The seed-based correlation maps were further analyzed with PCA to summarize differences in connectivity between the groups and states in terms of a few components that explain most of the variance in the data.</p>
      <p id="P35">Consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Glover, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Deen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Uddin et al., 2009</xref>), activity in the anterior insula was found to be positively correlated with that in the anterior cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobe (‘anterior insula positive network’), and negatively correlated with PCu/PCC and lateral parietal cortices (‘anterior insula negative network’; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, our analysis yielded an FC pattern (in the form of the 3<sup>rd</sup> principal component) with a spatial map that is, to a large extent, the inverse of the mean anterior insula connectivity (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) and whose involvement in epilepsy patients was relatively high (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>–<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). This finding indicates weaker anterior insula networks in epilepsy patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, this weakening was more pronounced in the low state (characterized by more regular cardiac and breathing activity).</p>
      <p id="P36">Our results also showed that the connectivity of cuneus and PCu/PCC is altered in epilepsy patients (low- and high-risk patients and SUDEP cases; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Fig. 3</xref>–<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl. Fig. 4</xref>), which is in line with previous findings (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Kay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Rajpoot et al., 2015</xref>); However, we found no evidence specifically implicating the aforementioned regions in SUDEP. Namely, the principal components that discriminated epilepsy patients from healthy controls did not reveal significant differences between SUDEP cases and low- or high-risk patients.</p>

        <title>Relationship of anterior insula connectivity to survival time from fMRI scan</title>
        <p id="P37">The observation of a negative correlation between the strength of anterior insula connectivity during the high state (irregular cardiorespiratory activity) and the interval between the fMRI scan and time of SUDEP may point to a predictive marker. Specifically, we found that patients who died sooner after the fMRI scan (2–4 years post-scan) exhibited lower anterior insula connectivity compared to patients who died later (5–8 years post-scan; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.02, uncorrected; N = 9; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). While this suggests an important dysfunctional role specific to the insula in SUDEP, it should be pointed out that the strength of anterior insula connectivity with its associated positive and negative networks was similar in SUDEP cases to that for low- and high-risk patients. Therefore, it is likely that other factors are required to coexist with weak connectivity in anterior insula to predispose individuals with epilepsy to SUDEP.</p>
        <p id="P38">The anterior insula is known to play a major role in cardiovascular and respiratory functions, and has reciprocal connections with several limbic structures, including the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala and hypothalamus (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Palma and Benarroch, 2014</xref>). It receives viscerosensory inputs and, through its projections to brainstem output nuclei, contributes to regulation of blood pressure and other autonomic responses (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Benarroch, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Oppenheimer and Cechetto, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Palma and Benarroch, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Ruggiero et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Saper, 1982</xref>). Functional imaging studies consistently report activation of the anterior insula in a wide range of interoceptive stimuli including dyspnea, ‘air hunger’ and heartbeat awareness, as well as in emotional processing (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Brannan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Craig, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Zaki et al., 2012</xref>). In epilepsy, it has been suggested that seizures may affect insula activity leading to respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmia, thereby increasing the risk of SUDEP (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Oppenheimer, 2001</xref>). However, scalp EEG, as used typically in the clinic for detecting seizures, has poor sensitivity to electrical activity from deep structures such as the insula and, as a consequence, it is difficult to assess whether seizure-induced autonomic manifestations are caused by insular dysfunction (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Oppenheimer and Cechetto, 2016</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P39">Altered FC between the insula and cingulate cortex in SUDEP and high-risk cases has been previously shown (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2019a</xref>), which is in line with our findings. In addition, patients that died of SUDEP at a time close to a structural MRI scan exhibited increased volume of the anterior insula (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2019b</xref>), further supporting the notion that impairment in the anterior insula may contribute to SUDEP. Finally, we recently found, in epilepsy patients, abnormal connectivity of the insula with the thalamus relative to changes in cardiac rhythms (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Kassinopoulos et al., 2021</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that, in epilepsy, the communication of the anterior insula with other regions of the central nervous system may deteriorate over time, potentially leading to increased risk of cardiorespiratory failure.</p>

        <title>Impaired communication between ventral and default mode network in epilepsy patients</title>
        <p id="P40">We observed that activity in the anterior insula is positively correlated with that in regions of the ventral network and negatively correlated with regions of the default mode network (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), and that this effect is weaker in patients with epilepsy, and is linked to SUDEP (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Seeley et al. (2007)</xref> first identified the so-called ventral network (also known as salience network) consisting of the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex as well as subcortical and limbic structures, with their activity linked to measures of anxiety. Subsequent functional studies implicated ventral attention regions mediating sympathetic activity (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Beissner et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, regions of the default mode network, including the posterior cingulate cortex, were found to be associated with parasympathetic activity (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Beissner et al., 2013</xref>). <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Sridharan et al. (2008)</xref> demonstrated that the salience network, and particularly the anterior insula, is responsible for reducing activity in the default mode network during goal-directed tasks. Initial studies attributed autonomic dysfunction in epilepsy to seizures originating from, or spreading to, individual regions such as the anterior insula (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Oppenheimer, 2001</xref>) and anterior cingulate cortex (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Devinsky et al., 1995</xref>). However, our results suggest also the possibility that cardiorespiratory failure may rise from impaired communication between the ventral and default mode network due to insula dysfunction which could also explain the alteration in parasympathetic and sympathetic activity observed often in individuals with epilepsy (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Myers et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

        <title>Limitations and possible future work</title>
        <p id="P41">Our study has a number of limitations: The unavailability of concurrent PPG and respiratory belt recordings led us in using GSA as a probe of cardiac and breathing activity. Although GSA reflects physiological changes, it cannot distinguish between irregular cardiovascular (transient increase in heart rate, variations in PPG amplitude, variations in blood pressure) and breathing (transient apnea, variations in tidal volume, etc.), with possible loss of sensitivity. For most witnessed SUDEP events, a TCS is observed a few minutes before death which triggers abnormal breathing patterns followed by episodes of bradycardia and terminal asystole, pointing to possible future studies focused on the link between irregular breathing and brain connectivity.</p>
        <p id="P42">Our data was collected during daytime. SUDEP often occurs at night and likely during sleep when physiological processes change (e.g. heart and respiratory rates initially decline, but then increase and become more variable on entering rapid eye movement sleep; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Purnell et al., 2018</xref>). Given these changes, in the present study, we sought to assess FC at different physiological states. However, the increased risk of SUDEP at night may result from other factors such as the influence of circadian rhythms and sleep on the brain, which could not be studied here since the fMRI data had been collected during daytime in a resting condition. While studying FC during sleep could help us understand the mechanisms underlying cardiorespiratory dysfunction, such studies are rare, as sleeping inside the scanner overnight is not well tolerated by participants. Therefore, fMRI studies need to consider protocols which mimic conditions that likely contribute to cardiorespiratory failure, while also being safe and practical. An example of such a test is the hypercapnic ventilatory response which was shown by <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Sainju et al. (2019)</xref> to indicate individuals with a prolonged increase in post-ictal CO<sub>2</sub> after TCS, that are arguably at a high risk of SUDEP. Future fMRI studies may need to consider breathing or cardiovascular challenges during scans, along with physiological monitoring, to better understand how regional brain areas respond to such manipulation in patients at risk for SUDEP.</p>
        <p id="P43">Finally, although our results suggest that the strength of anterior insula connectivity is inversely proportional to the interval between the fMRI scan and time of SUDEP (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = −0.74; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.02, uncorrected; N = 9; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), this finding is based solely on cross-sectional data and, thus, should be interpreted with caution. Longitudinal data are needed to directly address whether insular functions deteriorate over time in patients that later die of SUDEP or whether measures of anterior insula connectivity can be used as biomarkers of SUDEP risk.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p id="P44">In this work we revealed altered FC patterns of cuneus and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex in epilepsy as compared to healthy controls during periods of regular cardiorespiratory rhythms. This was based on the use of global signal amplitude (GSA), which we showed to be a surrogate of cardiorespiratory rhythm irregularity (transient apnea, transient increase in heart rate, etc.). In addition, we found reduced anterior insula connectivity in epilepsy, particularly during regular cardiac and breathing activity. For SUDEP cases, this effect was inversely correlated with the scan-SUDEP interval. Overall, our results suggest that connectivity measures of anterior insula are potential biomarkers for SUDEP risk. Future research efforts should focus on gaining insight into the role of anterior insula connectivity in seizure-induced cardiorespiratory failure and how intervention strategies could be employed to restore anterior insula function.</p>

        <p id="P48">(<bold>A</bold>) The global signal amplitude (GSA), defined as the moving standard deviation of the fMRI global signal (window length: 80 sec), was computed and used to determine times with regular (‘low state’) and irregular (‘high state’) cardiorespiratory activity.

(<bold>C</bold>) Finally, for each seed, the connectivity strength vectors were concatenated across subjects and states, and the resulting two-dimensional matrix (left of the equal sign) was fed into a principal component analysis (PCA) to derive the underlying group-level FC patterns.</p>

(<bold>B</bold>) FC pattern of component #3 derived from the anterior insula connectivity profiles of all subjects through PCA.

The FC pattern of component #3 was to a large degree opposite of the anterior insula connectivity profile. Thus, a positive component weight as found in the epilepsy groups can be interpreted as weakening of the anterior insula connectivity with its typical connections (e.g. anterior and posterior cingulate cortex).
