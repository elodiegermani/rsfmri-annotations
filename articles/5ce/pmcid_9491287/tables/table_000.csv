Head displacement,"Head motion parameters (HMPs): Six parameters (three rotations and three translations about/along the x‐, y‐, and z‐axes) included as noise regressors (6HMP). Additional regressors derived from the six parameters (e.g., temporal and quadratic terms of each parameter, as well as their difference) are often included to account for delayed and nonlinear motion‐induced spin history effects (24HMP; Friston et al., ???)."
Head displacement,"Spike regression (Satterthwaite et al., ???): For each volume containing excessive motion, a separate regressor is generated containing a value of 1 at that volume, and 0 at all others. Volumes are considered contaminated if FDJenk >0.25 mm. FDJenk represents the root mean squared of the six motion parameters (Jenkinson et al., ???)."
Head displacement,"Scrubbing (Power et al., ???): Each volume containing excessive motion is removed from the time series if FDPower >0.2 mm or DVARS >2%. After removal, uncontaminated segments of BOLD data lasting fewer than five contiguous volumes are also removed. FDPower represents the sum of the absolute values of the differentiated realignment estimates (by backward differences) at every time point."
Physiology‐related,"Physiological regressors (2phys): Regression of the average signal from WM and CSF, tissues not expected to exhibit BOLD oscillations tied to neural activity."
Physiology‐related,"Anatomical Component‐Based Correction (aCompCor; Behzadi et al., ???/aCompCor50; Muschelli et al., ???): This approach involves extracting orthogonal components of temporal variance from voxel‐wise time series for the WM and CSF masks separately. Then, either the five components with greater eigenvalue for each tissue are included in the denoising regression (aCompCor), or as many components as needed to cumulatively explain at least 50% of the variance in each tissue (aCompCor50)."
Mixed approaches,Global signal regression (GSR): Regression of the average signal across all the voxels of the brain.
Mixed approaches,"ICA‐based Automatic Removal Of Motion Artifacts (ICA‐AROMA; Pruim, Mennes, van Rooij, et al., ???): Automated data‐driven method to identify and remove via regression motion‐related independent components."
