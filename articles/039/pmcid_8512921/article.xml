      <title>Commentary</title>
      <p>Although the most common structural defect associated with medial temporal lobe epilepsy
(mTLE) is hippocampal sclerosis,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-15357597211021080" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> studies with magnetoencephalography (MEG),<sup><xref rid="bibr2-15357597211021080" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),<sup><xref rid="bibr3-15357597211021080" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and positron emission tomography (PET)<sup><xref rid="bibr4-15357597211021080" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> have characterized large-scale functional networks of brain activity or connectivity
in this population. Studies with fMRI have been especially useful in exploring the
connectivity of different brain regions far from the temporal lobe. Liao et al<sup><xref rid="bibr5-15357597211021080" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> used graph theory analysis of fMRI data collected from patients with temporal lobe
epilepsy (TLE) to examine functional connectivity in a broad set of brain regions and
demonstrated significantly increased connectivity within the medial temporal lobes, but
decreased connectivity with frontal and parietal regions. Holmes et al<sup><xref rid="bibr6-15357597211021080" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> used voxel-wise linear regression analysis to show a network of impairment in TLE
associated with thalamus, midcingulate gyrus, precuneus, and postcentral gyrus. Other
studies have implicated the amygdala, the entorhinal cortices, lateral temporal neocortices,
the inferior frontal lobes, the cerebellum, and the brainstem as part of the TLE
network.</p>
      <p>The work of González et al<sup><xref rid="bibr7-15357597211021080" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> introduces the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) as a significant node in the altered
network of mesial TLE. Their finding is provocative in that the NBM is not within the
traditional limbic system of subcortical structures commonly associated with mTLE. The
authors studied the resting state eyes-closed 10-minute T2*-weighted blood oxygenation
level–dependent fMRI in 40 consecutive patients with mTLE and 40 age- and sex-matched
controls. The article details an elegant series of experiments that carefully addresses
functional connectivity from several different complementary approaches. They defined 133
regions of interest for functional connectivity analyses including 108 from the
Harvard-Oxford atlas which they called whole brain. The authors used CONN toolbox 17 to
visualize seed-to-voxel NBM bivariate correlation functional connectivity differences
between patients with mTLE and controls. To complement seed-based NBM connectivity
comparisons, they analyzed how the community structure of NBM may change in mTLE with
community detection. Four hypothetical network models were postulated to determine which one
best explains the central connectivity network difference between patients and controls. For
all networks generated in the 4 models, the authors calculated the main network metrics
analyzed: NBM connectivity with the whole brain, NBM clustering coefficient, and node
strength to module of ipsilateral NBM to limbic community. To further elucidate the
reliability of NBM connectivity alterations in mTLE, the authors analyzed 3 network
characteristics and used binary logistic regression models to determine whether connectivity
properties of ipsilateral NBM alone could accurately identify whether each participant’s
dataset belonged to a patient or controls. Results showed that patients displayed
connectivity decreases between NBM and broad neocortical regions compared to controls. Data
also suggest closer functional connections between NBM and limbic structures than with other
subcortical arousal nuclei in controls. Results indicate decreased connections involving
ipsilateral but not contralateral NBM, bilateral hippocampi, and amygdala. Of the 4
hypothetical network models postulated, the ipsilateral NBM had a sensitivity and
specificity of 75% and 83%, respectively, in predicting whether a participant’s dataset
belonged to a patient or controls. The authors conclude that their results suggest that NBM
ipsilateral to epileptogenic zone represents a key structure in the altered mTLE
network.</p>
      <p>The main strength of this article is the use of a series of experiments to demonstrate that
the NBM is intricately tied to the medial temporal lobe in patients with mTLE. The authors
went to great lengths to eliminate potential bias: mTLE patients were selected
consecutively, the controls were age- and gender-matched, and the whole brain was analyzed
as opposed to only the “common” areas typically linked to TLE. The initial analysis was made
using seed-to-voxel group-level comparisons between the different regions in epilepsy
patients and controls. Then, community detection algorithms identified groups of brain nodes
that most strongly functionally connect to each other. Network-based statistic was used to
identify core networks of connected nodes with connectivity decreases in patients compared
to controls. The use of unbiased network-sampling methods to compare 4 hypothetical models
was an additional substudy not usually seen in fMRI connectivity papers. The overall
experimental design approached the research question from several complementary angles, and
the results were concordant in demonstrating the voxel containing the NBM ipsilateral to the
side of seizure onset may contain one of the most disturbed brain network nodes in TLE.</p>
      <p>Although this was an elegant series of experiments, there are a couple of methodologic
concerns. The NBM is a small structure in the basal forebrain in close proximity to the
medial temporal lobe. The 3.0 × 3.0 × 4.0 mm<sup>3</sup> voxel used this study is standard
for most fMRI studies of the forebrain but incorporates a fairly large region of interest.
It is crucial to ensure that the NBM voxel does not include any portion of the ipsilateral
medial temporal lobe, or the nucleus accumbens, which has recently been implicated in the
mTLE network.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-15357597211021080" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Data from multi-echo acquisition sequences combined with smaller voxel sizes may be
needed to validate the current results. A second concern (which was noted by the authors) is
that the study did not provide a method to confirm that patients remained fully awake during
the resting state fMRI acquisition. Although one can reasonably postulate that this
limitation would apply equally to patients and controls, I would argue that patients with
TLE are more likely to become drowsy in that testing environment as they are on
medication(s) which often have sedation and somnolence as common side effects.</p>
      <p>The possibility that the NBM is an important node in the mTLE network is a novel discovery.
If validated, this finding has ramifications for potentially explaining some of the
comorbidities associated with the disease. The NBM has long been known to be a major source
of cholinergic input to the cortex and neuronal loss in this structure is seen in some
dementing illnesses such as Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease. Studies suggest
that the modulation of cortical activity through this cholinergic system subserves cognitive
functions, especially in the domains of memory and attentional processing.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-15357597211021080" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Selective lesions to the NBM region in animal models disrupt cortical cholinergic
neurotransmission and are associated with impaired performance on spatial learning and
target detection tasks.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-15357597211021080" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Dysfunction in the NBM caused by recurrent pathological electrical activity in the
mTLE network may contribute to the memory and cognitive deficits in patients with TLE.
Further studies are needed to determine whether the NBM can attend the mTLE party.</p>
