"(1) Baliki MN, et al. 2014","RS fMRIIndependent component network analysis; ROIs included: mPFC, Pre-Cu, ACC, LP, IFG, SMG, INS","18 CBP (5 F, 13 M)19 CRPS (16 F, 3M)14 OA (6 F, 8 M)","32 (24 F, 12 M)","CBP and CRPS patients show decreased MPFC and increased PreCu representation within the DMN.MPFC-INS connectivity showed high correlation to pain intesity in CBP (R = 0.75, p<0.01), CRPS (R = 0.71, p<0.01) and OA (R = 0.61, p<0.05)DMN high frequency spectral power shows significant positive correlation to pain duration in CBP (R = 0.65, p,0.01) and OA (R = 0.77, p,0.01), but not in CRPS (R = 0.11, p = 0.87)","MPFC exhibits connectivity changes in proportion to intensity of pain.The extent of association of the medial prefrontal component of the DMN with the insula, and its dissociation from the posterior components of the DMN, appears to be a function of the intensity of the chronic pain and the duration of its persistence"
"(3) Baliki MN, et al. 2012","Resting state (RS) fMRIFunctional ROI for NAc, mPFC, INS determined from VBM","39 SBP (20 F, 19 M)","17 (7 F, 10 M)","Increased connectivity of nucleus accumbens with PFC predicted pain persistence.At one–year follow–up, there was decreased negative functional connectivity in SBPp between insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC) and precuneus (PreCu). This reduced functional connectivity was related positively with insula gray matter density and negatively with pain intensity.",Implication that corticostriatal circuitry may be involved in transition from acute to chronic pain.Implication that the functional reorganization of the insula may be coupled with gray matter changes and directly relate to the persistence of pain.Medications were controlled and results demonstrated medication-independent FC changes
"(7) Yu R, et al. 2014","RS fMRISeed-based analysis using vlPAG; ROIs: vmPFC/ACC, anterior insula, posterior insula, and amygdala","18 cLBP(12 F, 6 M)","18 (12 F, 6 M)",FC between the PAG and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)/rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) increased in cLBP patients compared to matched controlsNegative correlations between pain ratings and PAG–vmPFC/rostral ACC FC in cLBP patients after pain-inducing maneuver.cLBP duration was negatively correlated with PAG–posterior insula and PAG–amygdala FC before any pain-inducing maneuver.,Did not find a correlation FC and severity of cLBP for ROIs at rest but did find a negative correlation between PAG-vmPFC/rostral ACC after pain-inducing maneurver (mechanical back pain).cLBP patients have abnormal FC in PAG centered pain modulation network during rest
"(10) Deogaonkar M, et al. 2016",RS-fMRI performed with stimulator off and stimulator at optimum pain relief settings;Seed based analysis of FC for elements in pain network and DMN,10 CPRS or neuropathic leg pain,Same group,Decreased connection strength between somatosensory and limbic areas and increased connection strength between somatosensory and DMN with optimal SCS resulting in pain relief.,"SCS reduced the affective component of pain resulting in optimal pain relief.Suggests that pain relief from SCS may be reducing negative emotional processing associated with pain, allowing somatosensory areas to become more integrated into default mode activityHeterogeneous population, no blinding, no true control group for comparison"
"(12) Hemington KS, et al. 2016",RS FC MRICross-network connectivity analysis between the DMN and SN,"20 AS (3 F, 17 M)","20 (3 F, 17 M)","Patients exhibited less anticorrelated FC between SN and DMN, and the degree of cross-network abnormality tracked pain and disease-related symptoms.Sensorimotor cortex cross-network FC correlated with measures of physical function.",Suggests that cross-network FC may be a metric of functional brain abnormality in chronic pain.Physical functioning also impacts brain network interaction in chronic pain.
"(13) Loggia ML, et al. 2013",ASL fMRIIndependent Component Analysis to investigate RS connectivity on ASL data,"16 CLBP (11 F, 5 M)","16 (11 F, 5 M)","cLBP patients demonstrated stronger baseline DMN connectivity to the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), a component of the MPFC, as well as to the left inferior parietal lobule.The strength of DMN-pgACC connectivity within this cluster was negatively correlated with clinical pain at baseline (r = -0.73, p = 0.001)There was a stronger DMN-insula connectivity in the cLBP patients","The performance of calibrated physical maneuvers induced changes in pain, which were paralleled by changes in DMN-INS connectivity.Greater clinical pain at baseline was associated with greater DMN connectivity with the insula and less connectivity with the pgACC."
