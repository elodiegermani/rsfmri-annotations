Parameters for data collection,"A time series of 150 dynamic timeframes of volumetric images with matrix size=76 × 76 × 34. TE/TR 35/2500 ms, 34 slices of 3.5 mm thick, and FOV = 225 mm."
Description of data collection,"The MRI data acquisition was conducted on a whole-body 3T clinical MRI scanner (Magnetom Trio, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32-channel phased-array receiving head coil. All data was acquired at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Stockholm, between noon and 5:00 PM. The MRI data acquisition protocol included the following scanning sessions: (1) 3-plane localizer to guide remaining data sampling; (2) Conventional clinical MRI scans including 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE, T2 and FLAIR scans; (3) A session of 375 s long R-fMRI measurements. The main acquisition parameters for the R-fMRI data included the following: TE/TR 35/2500 ms, flip angle = 90°, 34 slices of 3.5 mm thick, FOV = 225 mm, matrix size = 76 × 76, data acquisition acceleration with GRAPPA parallel imaging method (iPAT = 2), and 150 dynamic timeframes."
