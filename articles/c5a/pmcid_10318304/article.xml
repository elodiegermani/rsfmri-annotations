        <p>Prior studies in younger adults showed that reducing the normally high intake of the saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid (PA), in the North American diet by replacing it with the monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid (OA), decreased blood concentrations and secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 and changed brain activation in regions of the working memory network. We examined the effects of these fatty acid manipulations in the diet of older adults. Ten subjects, aged 65–75 years, participated in a randomized, cross-over trial comparing 1-week high PA versus low PA/high OA diets. We evaluated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using an N-back test of working memory and a resting state scan, cytokine secretion by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated PBMCs, and plasma cytokine concentrations. During the low PA compared to the high PA diet, we observed increased activation for the 2-back minus 0-back conditions in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Broadman Area (BA) 9; p &lt; 0.005), but the effect of diet on working memory performance was not significant (p = 0.09). We observed increased connectivity between anterior regions of the salience network during the low PA/high OA diet (p &lt; 0.001). The concentrations of IL-1β (p = 0.026), IL-8 (p = 0.013), and IL-6 (p = 0.009) in conditioned media from LPS-stimulated PBMCs were lower during the low PA/high OA diet. This study suggests that lowering the dietary intake of PA down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and altered working memory, task-based activation and resting state functional connectivity in older adults.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="p0005">Cytokines secreted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), in response to infection, trauma, or cancer, transiently activate microglia and contribute to effects on the brain, such as fever, lethargy, and anorexia, that collectively have been called “sickness behavior” <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. For example, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) induce biochemical effects in the hypothalamus resulting in fever <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These responses to peripherally secreted cytokines are apt to be exaggerated in older adults, who generally exhibit a higher basal secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, sometimes referred to as “inflammaging” and who manifest brain dysfunction such as cognitive impairment <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This raises the question about whether physiological variations in secretion of cytokines, in the absence of stress such as infection, might affect cognition.</p>
      <p id="p0010">We have a long-standing interest in the metabolic effects of the most prevalent saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the human diet and body tissues, respectively palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA). We have evaluated contrasting effects of a high PA intake typical of the North American diet with the much lower PA intake and much higher OA intake observed in those ingesting the olive oil-rich diet characteristic of people living in Mediterranean countries <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In several recent studies of healthy younger adults, we have shown that reducing the normally, relatively high intake of PA by replacing it in the diet with OA causes reciprocal changes in the PA/OA ratio of cytosolic lipids, mitochondrial lipids (acylcarnitines), and serum phospholipids, with associated decreases in the secretion by PBMCs and blood concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These results are consistent with known effects of PA: (1) Stimulation of the cell membrane receptor, toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), which when activated induces a signaling sequence leading to the transcription of the genes for IL-6, TNFα, and pro-IL-1β, and (2) activation of the intracellular receptor, nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein (NLRP3) <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Activation of NLRP3 causes sequential recruitment of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein and caspase-1 to form the NLRP3 inflammasome complex <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>; multimerization of caspase-1 leads to its autocatalytic cleavage into an active form, which then is liberated from the inflammasome and subsequently cleaves pro-IL-1β into the secretable, mature IL-1β capable of activating its respective receptors <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p id="p0015">In the course of these same studies, we also discovered that lowering the dietary PA/OA ratio enhanced daily physical activity and improved mood <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These contrasting effects of PA and OA on the brain were consistent with a previous study, which reported that mice consuming a diet with lower saturated fat intake displayed improved sleep efficiency and locomotion <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, echoing our own study in younger adults. Considering our mood and physical activity data, we hypothesized that physiological changes in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines may induce changes in brain function via alterations in the PA/OA ratio of membrane and cellular lipids. Thus, we conducted another study of younger adults in whom we employed measurements of the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the fatty acid composition of serum phospholipids and additionally studied the effect of our dietary paradigm on activation of brain regions using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this study of younger adults, lowering the dietary PA/OA ratio caused the predicted lower secretion from PBMCs and plasma concentrations of IL-1β and IL-6, as well as a lower PA/OA ratio in serum phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Changes in the activation of the right caudate nucleus and left putamen in the basal ganglia during a working memory task were also found <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Another study in younger adults using resting state fMRI found that a higher intake of PA resulted in lower resting activity in the hippocampus and inferior parietal cortex <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p id="p0020">Because healthy older adults without dementia are still vulnerable to declines in episodic and working memory <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, we conducted a new study of older adults to examine how manipulation of the dietary PA/OA ratio impacted peripheral secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and brain function.</p>

        <p id="p0025">This study was approved by institutional committees associated with the University of Vermont Clinical Research Center (CRC) at The University of Vermont Medical Center. Subjects were recruited who met the following inclusion criteria (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>): biological males and females, aged 65–75 years; normal cognition; body mass index (BMI) 20–40 kg/M<sup>2</sup>. The BMI range was designed to avoid studying subjects with eating disorders or incipient illness (BMI &lt; 20) or subjects with morbid obesity (BMI greater than 40). The exclusion criteria were the following: actively training for an athletic event or participating in competitive sports (such as league play or tournaments); significant cognitive or behavioral impairment; hormone therapy during the last 3 months; hyperandrogenic condition; HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and/or fasting glucose ≥ 130 mg/dL; type 2 diabetes if receiving any other treatment than metformin; use of nicotine, caffeine, or alcohol during the study; habitual fat intake &lt; 25% of daily energy intake or strict vegetarian diet; sleep apnea requiring continuous positive airway pressure at night; lung, cardiac, liver, or renal disease; cancer; any other medical disorder known or thought to cause inflammation or abnormalities of cognition. No subject was enrolled who was undergoing treatment with metformin or who received any vaccine within three weeks of the start of the study. Four subjects were not vaccinated for COVID-19 when they participated in the study and six subjects had been vaccinated.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0005"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Descriptive statistics for demographic information and mood and neuropsychological measures from the screening visit.

        <p id="p0030">Thirty-one subjects were consented and assessed for eligibility. Seven subjects were excluded due to medical ineligibility. Two subjects were excluded due to dietary concerns. Specifically, one woman preferred to eat less gluten, and another was self-described as particular and did not like the food on the menu. Seven subjects withdrew consent and were no longer interested. Two subjects exceeded the age limit after the study was resumed following the shutdown of human subjects research during the COVID-19 pandemic. One subject was excluded due to poor performance on the neuropsychological assessments. Specifically, one woman performed greater than one standard deviation lower than the mean on the test of Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System (described below). Twelve subjects were randomized to the study conditions; see below for details. One subject dropped out because she could not tolerate the diet restrictions and one was withdrawn due to medical reasons. Five males and five females completed the study.</p>
        <p id="p0035">After screening for eligibility, discussed in more detail below, body composition was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> primarily to guide diet planning. The study sequence consisted of a low fat, control diet for 7 days followed by a 7-day experimental diet: either HPA (high palmitic acid) or HOA (high oleic acid and low palmitic acid). After a repeat, one-week control diet, the subjects then received a second experimental diet (HPA or HOA) for a 7-day period (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The two Experimental Diets, HPA and HOA, were administered in a random order, <underline>stratified by the sex of the subjects</underline>, using the random allotment procedures in SAS. Dr. Bunn, the biostatistician, generated the randomization order. The diets were referred to only as A and B, with the dietitian assigning the A and B codes to the appropriate diet. The CRC dietitian and her assistant were aware of the order and type of oil being consumed and prepared the oil blends. The Study Coordinators assisted with the preparation of the food for the subjects but were masked to the specific oil blend (HPA or HOA) that a subject was receiving on a given day and thus were also masked to the experimental diet order. Food intake was adjusted to maintain energy balance based on measurement of body weight. Subjects came to the CRC three times a week and were first weighed and had their temperature taken. Among the ten subjects, there was a weight change of −1.7% during the 4-wk study. However, there was no difference in the weight change during the HPA and HOA diets.

        <title>Diets</title>
        <p id="p0045">We provided all food and oil for each subject for every meal during the 4 week study period. Each of the three diets consisted of a set of menus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (2 sets for the baseline diet and three for the HPA and HOA diets). These menus consisted of various foods, including: lean turkey or chicken; fat-free dairy products; fruits and fruit juices; bread, muffins, and bagels; pasta and rice; egg substitute; cereals. Oil was added to the food tray in a plastic container, in an amount consistent with the overall energy content of the meal (including the oil) in order to attain the same macronutrient (including total FA) composition for each meal. Because oil amounts were different for each subject, the average oil for each day for each diet was the following: Control mean = 67.1 g (range 48.6 – 85.5 g)/day, HPA mean = 90.0 g (range 71.9–111.6 g)/day, and HOA mean = 90.1 g (range 73.6–114.5 g)/day. Because the meals were planned to provide one-third of the daily energy, fat etc., in general, the amount of oil ingested with each meal was approximately one-third of the daily total. The meals for each subject on each diet were identical for the HPA and HOA diets, such that only the oil added to the meals was different. The oil blends were the following: (1) Control Diet: palm oil-36.9%, high oleic sunflower oil-19.3%, and hazelnut oil-43.8%; (2) HPA Diet: palm oil-89%, peanut oil-6.75%, and virgin olive oil-4.25%; (3) HOA Diet: 100% hazelnut oil. The amount of oil added on a particular day to a given subject was based on the subject’s energy intake and the percent of energy as fat for the given diet. Based on analysis (Eurofins Food Chemistry Testing, Madison, WI), the baseline/control diet was low in fat: Protein, 19.7 % kcal; Carbohydrate, 51.6 % kcal; Fat, 28.4 % kcal; PA, 5.3 % kcal; OA, 15.9 % kcal. The high PA (HPA) diet resembled the habitual diet of the subjects: Protein, 16.8 % kcal; Carbohydrate, 42.8 % kcal, Fat, 40.4 % kcal; PA, 16.0 % kcal; OA, 16.2 % kcal. The high OA (HOA) diet was low in PA and high in OA: Protein, 16.9 % kcal; Carbohydrate, 43.5 % kcal, Fat, 40.1 % kcal; PA, 1.7 % kcal; OA, 31.4 % kcal.</p>
        <p id="p0050">All returned food trays were inspected, and the constituent food items and oils were weighed. On average, subjects consumed ≥97% of targeted macronutrients during the study. There were 28 days of diet consumption for each subject. During the control diets (14 days total), there was an average of 1.75 days when some food was returned; the respective values for HOA and HPA were 1.5 and 1.9 days. During the 7 days of each of the HOA and HPA diets, an average of 99.6% and 98.7% of the oils respectively were consumed.</p>

        <p id="p0065">Participants completed a visual verbal N-back Test of working memory during the fMRI. This N-back task had three equivalent versions so that a different version was administered on each MRI day. The specific task version was counterbalanced across study days for each participant. Participants saw a string of consonants (except L, W, and Y), presented in upper case letters, one every three seconds. Four conditions were presented: 0-back, 1-back, 2-back, and 3-back. The 0-back control condition has a minimal working memory load; participants are asked to decide if the current letter matches a single target letter that was specified before the epoch began. In the 1-, 2-, and 3-back conditions, participants indicated whether the current letter on the screen matched a letter that was either 1, 2 or 3 back. The 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back conditions were repeated three times in a counterbalanced order such that the same condition was not repeated two times in a row. In this block design task, participants responded to nine items in each block that took 27 s. A rest break followed with a plus sign (+) fixation for 12 s. The total time of the task was 8 min 12 s. Participants practiced the N-back task before the MRI session to ensure that they understood task instructions. Working memory performance measures included hits and false alarms from each of the 4 conditions.</p>

Freshly-collected cells were plated at 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and treated in duplicate under control conditions or were stimulated by the addition of ultrapure lipopolysaccharide (LPS; from <italic>E. coli</italic> O111:B4, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) over a range of doses from 0.01 to 10 ng/ml.

We report the values associated with the 1 ng/ml LPS dose because this was the one that for the majority of cytokines elicited cytokine production that was substantially more than from the unstimulated cells yet didn’t maximally-stimulate the cells. Consequently, we felt this dose best afforded us the capacity to determine whether the different diets had any inhibitory or augmentative effects on LPS-induced cytokine production by the PBMCs.</p>

        <title>Statistics</title>
        <p id="p0090">We received NIH funding (R56 AG062105) to conduct this initial study over one year, examining how dietary fatty acids and systemic inflammatory tone might interact to affect brain function and cognitive performance in older adults. The funding allowed for a relatively fixed number of subjects, without necessarily achieving the statistically significant results based on an initial power analysis, which suggested that we needed 40 subjects to assess diet effects on working memory performance. All data, except those from the fMRI studies, are expressed as mean ± SEM, and a <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05 was selected as statistically significant. This study employed a two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence cross-over design. Diet effects were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance, including sequence and treatment effects, with the baseline value as a covariate. Statistical analyses for the task-based fMRI were performed using a 2 (Diet: HOA vs. HPA) X 2 (Working Memory Load: 2-back vs. 0-back) random effects ANOVA using standard ANOVA procedures in Brain Voyager (Brain Voyager QX, The Netherlands). During preprocessing of the functional MRI data, the volumes were realigned to the first volume to minimize the effects of head movements. Further preprocessing included spatial (4 mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel) as well as temporal filters to remove aliased signal correlated with background respiration and heart rate. Anatomical and functional images were co-registered and normalized to Talairach space. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple linear regression of the signal time course at each voxel. The hemodynamic response function was accounted for in these models. To correct for multiple comparisons, we used a voxel level correction of p &lt; 0.005.</p>
        <p id="p0095">Statistical analysis for resting-state functional connectivity data was preformed using a within-subjects design to compare connectivity measures following HOA and HPA diets using CONN toolbox version 20.b, an SPM-based software. Functional and structural images were preprocessed using the preprocessing pipeline for volume-based analyses (direct normalization to MNI-space) using FieldMaps. Preprocessing steps included the creation of voxel-displacement map for susceptibility distortion correction, realignment, unwrapping, slice-timing correction, outlier detection, direct segmentation and normalization, segmentation and normalization, and smoothing. Slice order was interleaved bottom-up and smoothing kernel was 8 mm. Functional connectivity measures were computed for predefined seed regions for an ROI-to-ROI analysis, results that survived a false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected threshold of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were reported.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="p0125">This study found in healthy older adults that a one-week diet low in the saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid, compared to one week of a diet high in palmitic acid resulted in decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreased serum LDL concentration, and changes in brain functioning measured by BOLD fMRI. This pattern was reversible as subjects were randomly assigned to the diet order. Our results indicate that reversible activation of relevant brain regions (e.g., DLPFC) during a working memory task occured when there was a marked reduction of dietary intake of PA.</p>
      <p id="p0130">It can also be inferred that subjects were consuming the diets as instructed based on analysis of returned dietary oil and the change in LDL between the HOA and HPA diets; these results were consistent with those observed in previous studies <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. These data showed for the first time that in older adults lowering the level of palmitic acid in the diet resulted in reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (within a physiological range) with associated alterations in brain functioning. Significant brain effects of the low palmitic acid diet were found on working memory, task-based activation and resting state functional connectivity, but there was no statistically significant effect on working memory performance (p = 0.09). Our work in older adults showing that one week of an altered dietary PA/OA ratio can affect systemic inflammatory tone and brain function is mirrored by some studies in aged rats <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. One study in aged rats suggested that a PA-enriched diet for three days resulted in enhanced gene expression of microglial activation markers, pro-IL-1β, and NLRP3 in the hippocampus <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Another study showed that a three day high fat diet in aged rats impaired long-term contextual memory and increased IL-1β protein in the hippocampus, and antagonizing IL-1β prevented the effect of the short-term, high fat diet on hippocampal-dependent contextual memory <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, although compelling even based on the modest number of subjects examined, our results reveal that a larger and fully powered study is needed to observe the effects of the fatty acid manipulation on memory and behavior.</p>
      <p id="p0135">We focused this study on older adults, but younger adults also may be affected by the same type of intervention. However, studies in young and aged rats suggest that older adults might be more vulnerable to the effects of a high PA diet on brain function <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Nevertheless, the overall interaction of decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and beneficial effects on brain function by lowering the PA intake, mirrors somewhat our previous study in young adult women <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Sartorius et al. <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, using resting state fMRI to study young adult subjects, found that there was a significant main effect in whole-brain intrinsic activity in the hippocampus and inferior parietal cortex (decrease in intrinsic activity) three months after a PA-enriched diet, whereas a OA-enriched diet showed no effects.</p>
      <p id="p0140">Importantly, this study provides novel evidence that manipulating physiological levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines with diet is associated with changes in brain functioning. The potential implications of this work are that brain functioning, even in older adults, can be improved through a relatively acute diet manipulation. The converse is also true in that one could make a dietary mistake by consuming meals high in saturated fat and also experience potentially acute effects of cognitive dysfunction. It is likely that older adults may be more susceptible to these dietary changes, although that is an empirical question, which was not examined here. There are additional interesting implications for improving cognition in older adults through relatively short-term dietary manipulations.</p>
      <p id="p0145">The BOLD fMRI measures used were a task-based working memory measure and a probe of the connectivity of the salience network during the resting state scan. The task-based fMRI showed greater activation for the HOA compared to the HPA diet in regions of the working memory network. Our data may be interpreted as evidence for HOA improving working memory functioning. The salience network was probed with a functional connectivity analysis. The salience network includes brain regions involved in directing attention to relevant stimuli in the environment and is involved in motivated behavior. We found increased connectivity after the HOA diet compared to the HPA diet between the insula and occipital regions of the network. It is unclear whether this connectivity is related to behavior in this small study. This finding further contributes to the accumulating evidence that this one week dietary manipulation of PA influenced brain function. A larger study will be needed to examine the associations with cytokine secretion and implications for cognition and behavior.</p>
      <p id="p0150">In the course of several studies of young adults, we <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> consistently showed that lowering the usual PA intake of the North American diet (HPA diet) to a level more consistent with that seen in people mostly ingesting olive oil as a source of fat (HOA diet) significantly (and reversibly) decreased the rate of peripheral secretion of IL-1β and IL-6. In the present study, although we did not observe significant effects of the diets on plasma cytokine concentrations, the p values for IL-1β (p = 0.058) and TNF-α (p = 0.07) approached statistical significance. Whether lack of power or too short of a diet duration restricted our ability to observe statistically significant changes in plasma cytokine concentrations is unclear, but we did observe dietary effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by monocytes, a putative mechanistic predecessor to changes in plasma cytokine concentrations, and Kiecolt-Glaser et al. <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> did observe effects of similar diets given as a single meal on systemic inflammatory tone. These results support our notion that the duration of the diets employed in the current study was sufficient to elicit changes in the measured parameters, and that a larger subject number would provide the necessary power to demonstrate significant effects on circulating pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations. Our previous studies employed a three-week dietary intervention design. The present study extends these results to older adults with a 7-day intervention.</p>
      <p id="p0155">There are data implicating these cytokines in brain function in general and in the pathogenesis of progressive dementia. Memory is inhibited by elevated levels of both IL-1β and IL-18 in brain tissue <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Patients with reduced executive function after cardiac surgery exhibited decreased DLPFC functional connectivity with the superior parietal lobe and attenuated negative connectivity in the default mode network, including the angular gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex; these findings were linked to increased plasma concentrations of IL-6 and especially TNFα <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Inflammation affects normal brain function, perhaps by impacting insulin signaling in the brain <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Elevated levels of IL-1β in the hippocampus impaired memory consolidation <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Moreover, the effect of inflammation on cognition may be mediated, at least in part, by intermediate effects on sleep and physical activity <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Sartorius et al. <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> found that blocking TLR4 or the use of a neutralizing IL-6 antibody improved brain function, including enhanced sleep efficiency and locomotion. Inflammatory cytokines secreted by mononuclear cells outside the central nervous system can impact brain cell function via several mechanisms: diffusion into regions of the brain lacking a blood brain barrier; binding of cytokines to receptors on endothelial cells forming the blood–brain barrier; selective transport of cytokines involving transporters that are part of the blood–brain barrier; and activation of the vagal and sympathetic nervous system <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Moreover, microglia respond to these inflammatory signals by also producing cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and IL-1β) <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p id="p0160">Our results on brain function and inflammatory tone are consistent with prior studies showing effects of high versus low PA intake in a single meal <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> as well as animal studies (e.g., <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>). These studies, when considered in the context of the results reported here, suggest that “every meal matters” in terms of the acute effects of dietary fatty acids on inflammatory tone and cognition. However, it is important to draw some contrasts between studies conducted directly after a meal and the data from our study collected about 12 h after the most recent meal. The experimental, single-meal interventions used by Hanson et al. <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and Kiecolt-Glaser et al. <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> included carbohydrate, which, indirectly, might modify baseline inflammatory tone and brain function. A meal containing carbohydrate will induce both insulin and glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion as well as elevating the blood concentration of glucose. GLP-1, insulin, and glucose all may affect brain function acutely, particularly cognition, either directly or via changes in the brain uptake of amino acids that are precursors for neurotransmitters (e.g., tryptophan and tyrosine) <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In addition, both glucose and insulin may modify inflammatory tone <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. These issues in no way invalidate the conclusions of Hanson et al. <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and Kiecolt-Glaser et al. <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, which were based on controlled fatty acid interventions, but do show that the immediate, post-meal effects of fatty acids could have potentially distinct effects from those seen in the fasted state after a brief but sustained period of daily ingestion of the same fatty acids. Indeed, unpublished data from one of our studies <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> did not show statistically significant effects of the HOA versus HPA diet, when blood for pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and plasma cytokine concentrations were assessed from blood drawn in the fed state.</p>
      <p id="p0165">One notable limitation of this study is the small sample size and inability to examine sex differences in brain and proinflammatory responses to our fatty acid manipulation. It will be important to complete a larger study powered to test sex differences as there are sex differences in AD and sex specific proinflammatory factors that may underlie risk for dementia. Approximately two-thirds of AD patients are women <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Deceases in gonadal steroids through either bilateral ovariectomy or natural menopause increase systemic inflammatory tone, as characterized by increased circulating levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Thus, there may be sex-specific inflammatory processes that contribute to pathological brain aging. In our prior studies in younger adults, we have examined sex differences in the response to effects of the dietary PA/OA ratio on systemic inflammatory tone. In one previous study <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, we did observe, in males versus females, almost identical differential effects of the HOA and HPA diets on PBMC secretion of IL-1β (unpublished data). However, in earlier studies, we have found that young men and women do respond differently to an identical manipulation of the dietary PA/OA ratio, with respect to a number of metabolic indices including fat oxidation rate <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and insulin sensitivity and secretion and systemic inflammatory tone <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. We hope to examine how manipulating dietary PA/OA ratio affects brain function and proinflammatory processes differentially for each sex in a larger study.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p id="p0170">Our data emphasize that the effects of dietary fatty acids on systemic inflammatory tone and brain function do not necessarily depend on a diet being followed for weeks or months. Instead, we liken the effects of our two interventional diets on pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and brain function to those of a drug, which must be continually ingested to be effective. In contrast to many medications that are designed to alter pathological processes that take months or years to cause morbidity (e.g., drugs to lower LDL), the diet effects on brain function we observed are meaningful and potentially clinically and socially relevant (e.g., financial and self-care decision-making or attention during motor vehicle operation), even if days or weeks later a less favorable series of meals are ingested. It is plausible that the dietary PA/OA ratio also may affect the progression of cognitive dysfunction seen during cognitive aging and dementia. In this human study, we cannot demonstrate that the effects of the dietary PA/OA ratio on systemic inflammatory tone are causally related to the effects of this dietary ratio on brain function. Perhaps, known pharmacological interventions for modulating IL-1β (e.g., anakinra <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>) and IL-6 secretion (e.g., tocilizumab <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>) could be studied, at safe dosages, lower than presently used, to show that modulating pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion indeed affects brain function and alters cognition consistently over long periods of time.</p>
