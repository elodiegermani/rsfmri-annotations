Local measures,
Degree: the number of neighbors (connections) for each node,"For a given node i:ki=∑j∈NaijN: set of all nodes in the network andaij: connection between i and j: aij = 1 when the link (i, j) exists, and 0 otherwise. There are no self-loops in the network; therefore aii = 0."
"Path length: the potential for information transmission along the shortest paths, calculated as the average distance from one node to all other nodes","Path length for a given node i (???):Li=∑j∈N,j≠idijn−1n: Number of nodes anddij: shortest path length (distance) between nodes i and j."
"Clustering coefficient: the extent to which the neighbors of a given node are interconnected (i.e., the fraction of triangles around a node)","Clustering coefficient of the network (???):Ci=∑j,k∈Naijaikajkki(ki−1)"
Efficiency: the efficiency of parallel information transfer of a given node determined as the average of the reciprocal shortest path length from a node to all other nodes,"Efficiency for a given node i (???):Ei=∑j∈N,j≠idij−1n−1"
Betweenness centrality: the ratio of all shortest paths in the graph that contain a given node,"Betweenness centrality of node i (???):BCi=1(n−1)(n−2)Σρhj(i)ρhjh,j∈Nh≠j,h≠i,j≠iρhj: number of shortest paths between h and j andρhj(i): number of shortest paths between h and j that use i."
Participation coefficient: the distribution of a node’s connections across its modules,Participation coefficient of node i (???):Pi=1−∑m∈M(ki(m)ki)2M: set of non-overlapping modules andki(m): number of links between i and all nodes in module m.
Global measures,
Characteristic path length: average path lengths over all nodes,Characteristic path length of the network (???):L=1n∑i∈NLiLi: average distance from node i to all other nodes (path length).
Clustering coefficient: average of the nodal clustering coefficients over all nodes,Clustering coefficient of the network (???):C=1n∑i∈NCiCi: clustering coefficient of node i.
"Small-worldness: an assessment used for networks in which most nodes are not adjacent to each other, but can be accessed by any other node with the minimum possible path length. Small-world networks are considered an intermediate between regular and random networks (i.e., they contain many short-range connections alongside a few long-range links), indicating a high clustering coefficient and a short path length.","Small-worldness of the network (???):σ=Cnet/CrandLnet/LrandCnet and Lnet are clustering coefficient and path length of a given network, and Crand and Lrand are these measures for an equivalent random network. Small-world networks have σ ⪢1."
Efficiency: average of the nodal efficiencies over all nodes,Global efficiency of the network (???):E=1n∑i∈NEiEi: efficiency of node i.
"Assortativity: the extent to which a network can resist failures in its main components. If r ≥ 0, the nodes with a high degree are more likely to connect to others that are similar in degree (an assortative network), while r < 0 reflects a tendency for high-degree nodes to attach to nodes with a low degree (a disassortative network).","Assortativity coefficient of the network (???):r=1I∑(i,j)∈Lkikj−[1I∑(i,j)∈L12(ki+kj)2]1I∑(i,j)∈L12(ki2+kj2)−[1I∑(i,j)∈L12(ki+kj)2]"
Synchronization: an examination of how network nodes fluctuate in the same wave pattern,"Synchronization of the network (???):S=λ(2)λ(M)λ(2): second smallest eigenvalue of the matrix of A,λ(M): largest eigenvalue of the matrix of A, andA: adjacency matrix of the network."
Mesoscale measures,
Modularity (single-slice): it reflects the quality of partitioning a network into clusters of densely interconnected nodes with sparse connections among other clusters,"Single-slice modularity of the network (???):Qsingleslice=12μ∑ij[Aij−γVij]δ(σi,σj)Aij and Vij: observed and expected weights of the connection between nodes i and jμ: total edge weight in the network,γ: structural resolution parameter,σi: community (i.e., “module”) assignment of node i, andδ(x, y): Kronecker delta function; it takes on a value of 1 when x = y, and 0 otherwise (assuming that the given network consists of M non-overlapping modules)."
"Modularity (multi-slice): in the multi-layer version of the modularity function, nodes are connected to themselves across layers by an inter-layer coupling parameter, ω","Multi-slice modularity of the network (???):Qmultislice=12μ∑ijsr[(Aijs−γVijs)δsr+ωδij]δ(σis,σjr)Aijs and Vijs: observed and expected weight of the connection between nodes i and j in layer s,μ, γ, and δ(x, y): defined as above,ω: interlayer coupling parameter,σis: community assignment of node i in slice s, andσjr: community assignment of node j in slice r."
Recruitment: the fraction of layers in which a node is assigned to the same community as other nodes from the same predefined/static system,"Recruitment of node (region) i in system S (???):RiS=1ns∑j∈SPijns: number of regions in S andPij: module allegiance between node i and node j. Module allegiance represents the fraction of layers in which nodes i and j are assigned to the same community. To construct an allegiance matrix, a co-occurrence matrix (N × N) for each layer is created, wherein the ijth element is equal to 1 if the nodes i and j have a shared community label, and 0 otherwise. The average of all co-occurrence matrices across layers forms the allegiance matrix, so its elements range from 0 to 1."
Integration: the fraction of layers in which a given node in system S is assigned to the same community as nodes from systems other than S,Integration of node i in system S (???):IiS=1N−ns∑j∉SPijN: total number of nodes (regions).
