      <abstract>
        <p>Neuroimaging research seeks to identify biomarkers to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although clinical translation of findings remains distant. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) is increasingly being used to characterize functional connectivity in the brain. Despite mixed results to date and multiple methodological challenges, dominant hypotheses implicate hyperconnectivity across brain networks in patients with ADHD, which could be the target of pharmacological treatments. We describe the experience and results of the Clínica Universidad de Navarra (Spain) Metilfenidato (CUNMET) pilot study. CUNMET tested the feasibility of identifying R-fMRI markers of clinical response in children with ADHD undergoing naturalistical pharmacological treatments. We analyzed cross-sectional data from 56 patients with ADHD (18 treated with methylphenidate, 18 treated with lisdexamfetamine, and 20 treatment-naive patients). Standard preprocessing and statistical analyses with attention to control for head motion and correction for multiple comparisons were performed. The only results that survived correction were noted in contrasts of children who responded clinically to lisdexamfetamine after long-term treatment vs. treatment-naive patients. In these children, we observed stronger negative correlations (anticorrelations) across nodes in six brain networks, which is consistent with higher across-network functional segregation in patients treated with lisdexamfetamine, i.e., less inter-network interference than in treatment-naive patients. We also note the lessons learned, which could help those pursuing clinically relevant multidisciplinary research in ADHD en route to eventual personalized medicine. To advance reproducible open science, our report is accompanied with links providing access to our data and analytic scripts.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 5–10% of children and adolescents (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and persisting into adulthood in about half of cases (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Pharmacological treatments address the core symptoms of ADHD; long-term benefits in functional outcomes, though questioned, are documented (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, predicting which medication will show the best efficacy and tolerability for any given individual is not feasible. Thus, current medication management consists of trial and error titration (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
      <p>Neuroimaging research in mental disorders, including ADHD, aims to elucidate the pathophysiology and neuropsychopharmacology of these conditions and their treatments in a quest for personalized medicine (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Yet, despite a growing literature and increasing methodological sophistication, neuroimaging is still unable to inform “bedside” clinical decisions (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>
      <p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) has become a mainstream brain imaging technique. It highlights the statistical properties of spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals to infer “functional connectivity” among spatially distant areas which represent putative brain functional networks (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>R-fMRI research in ADHD has identified widespread brain circuitry differences between patients and typically-developing control individuals (TDCs) and their possible normalization with medications; however, results have been inconsistent across studies (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Challenges to the validity and reproducibility of neuroimaging findings include insufficient control of in-scanner head motion, excessive false positive rates from inadequate control for multiple statistical comparisons, small sample size, lack of thorough reporting of methods and results and lack of open sharing of study data (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, research in neuroimaging and medication in ADHD has frequently used experimental treatment designs which are less relevant to finding the brain correlates of real-life treatment patterns (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>

      <title>The CUNMET Study</title>
      <p>The “Clínica Universidad de Navarra Metilfenidato” (CUNMET) study was designed as a proof-of-concept study in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Ph.D. [see also (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)]. The study was based at the child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient service at Clínica Universidad de Navarra, a tertiary university hospital in the north of Spain.</p>
      <p>CUNMET's overarching objective was to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a naturalistic neuroimaging study with a clinical sample of children and adolescents with ADHD, with the aim of exploring putative R-fMRI correlates of differential symptomatic response to stimulant medications. Specific objectives were: (1) To obtain phenotypic (i.e., demographic, clinical), neuropsychological, and R-fMRI data from a cross-sectional sample of children and adolescents with ADHD with differential pharmacological responses to stimulants and a longitudinal subsample of treatment-naive patients evaluated pre- and post-treatment; (2) to conduct rigorous and transparent methods to minimize the effects of imaging artifacts, in particular, head motion and false-positive rates, in the exploration of neural correlates of treatment response; (3) to explore reliable R-fMRI differences in whole-brain network correlations across treatment-response groups and treatment-naive patients, as well as the modulation of these correlations after treatment with methylphenidate in treatment-naive patients; (4) to transparently describe the challenges encountered and the limitations of the study; and (5) to contribute to open-science efforts through best practices in reporting and data sharing.</p>
      <p>Detailed information on methods is available in <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material</xref>. Our study included boys and girls aged 7–17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD based on DSM-5 criteria (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), falling into one of four groups: (1) patients who responded well to an extended-release formulation of methylphenidate (MPH) as the first-line treatment and were taking MPH; (2) patients who had not responded to MPH and responded to extended-release lisdexamfetamine (LDX) as second-line treatment and were taking LDX; (3) patients who had not responded to either MPH or LDX and responded to extended-release guanfacine (GFC) as the third treatment; and (4) patients who had not started medications when recruited (NAIVE). A subset of patients in the NAIVE group were invited into a longitudinal prospective pre- vs. post-treatment analysis after undergoing treatment with MPH. Clinical response was defined by either a reduction of at least 30% in parent-reported ADHD rating scale (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) or substantial improvement in Clinical Global Impression (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) after at least 3 months of the corresponding treatment. Main exclusion criteria were diagnosis of comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders and/or use of medication for symptoms of such disorders (with the exception of oppositional defiant disorder, headaches, and insomnia) and contraindications for MRI. The study had the corresponding ethical approvals, and participation was voluntary and required a written informed consent from the parents and assent from the patients.</p>
      <p>After consent and assent were obtained along with clinical assessments that confirmed inclusion/exclusion criteria were met, R-fMRI data were acquired with a Siemens MAGNETOM 3.0 Tesla Skyra (Siemens; Erlangen, Germany) with a Siemens 32-channel head coil. Each scan session lasted around 20 min and consisted of a R-fMRI echo planar imaging BOLD sequence (total duration = 8.41 min, eyes open, TR = 2,020 ms, TE = 30 ms, 36 slices, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3.5 mm, Field of View = 192 mm, flip angle = 80°, 250 volumes, matrix = 64 × 64), a perfusion-weighted ASL sequence (not further described here) and an anatomical T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (total duration = 5:12 min, TR = 2,300 ms, TE = 2.96 ms, number of blocks = 1, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.1 mm, field of view = 256 mm, flip angle = 9°, slices per block = 176, imaging matrix = 256 × 256).</p>
      <p>Briefly, preprocessing and quality control of images used the Configurable Pipeline for Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC, v.1.6.2a) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) which included skullstripping, segmentation, spatial normalization of anatomical images, slice timing correction, functional-to-anatomical registration, spatial normalization, nuisance signal correction (with CompCor (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), ICA-AROMA (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and scrubbing of volumes with more than 0.3 mm of framewise displacement, independent component analysis denoising, and median angle correction), band-pass filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz), spatial smoothing [full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel of 6 mm], and Z-scoring of functional image time series.</p>
      <p>Analyses were conducted at two levels of spatial resolution. Dual regression of the Smith et al. 10-network parcellation (medial visual, occipital pole visual, lateral visual, default mode, cerebellum, sensorimotor, auditory, executive control, and right and left frontoparietal) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) were used to extract time series of preprocessed data; we also used regions-of-interest from the Schaefer et al. 200-node parcellation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) which overlap with the Yeo et al. 17-network parcellation (visual A&amp;B, somatomotor A&amp;B, temporal-parietal, dorsal attention A&amp;B, salience-ventral attention A&amp;B, frontoparietal control A-C, default mode A-C, limbic A&amp;B) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Connectivity graphs were calculated for each individual and later used for group statistical analyses.</p>
      <p>Descriptive and comparative statistics of relevant phenotypic data consisted of across-group tests, conducted with STATA v.12.0 (StataCorp. 2011. <italic toggle="yes">Stata Statistical Software: Release 12</italic>. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP., <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.stata.com" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.stata.com</ext-link>). Group comparisons of neuroimaging graphs were performed using the Network-Based Statistic (NBS) Toolbox (<ext-link xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/comparison/nbs" ext-link-type="uri">https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/comparison/nbs</ext-link>) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Multiple comparisons were corrected through False Discovery Rate (FDR). Statistical significance was set at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons. The contrasts were:</p>
      <list list-type="simple">
        <list-item>
          <p>(a) Stimulant-treated vs. untreated (merged MPH + LDX groups vs. naive).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>(b) MPH-treated vs. untreated (MPH vs. naive).</p>

          <p>(d) MPH-treated vs. LDX-treated (MPH vs. naive).</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>We recruited a sample of 68 participants, who provided a total of 76 scans (21 MPH patients, 21 LDX, 3 GFC, and 23 naive; 8 Treatment-naive patients were scanned pre- and post-MPH treatment). This distribution deviated from the original plan (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 80; 20/group): first, GFC participants were difficult to recruit, due to the relative paucity of non-responders to stimulants in our clinic and their higher likelihood of presenting exclusion criteria; second, we were only able to obtain a post-treatment scan and evaluation in eight naive patients prior to the termination of the study at the end of the principal investigator's residency. Due to insufficient recruitment, the three GFC participants were excluded from analyses. Similarly, the eight post-treatment scans from the subgroup of naive participants who were assessed pre- and post-MPH were also excluded; instead, resources were shifted to slightly increase the samples in the MPH, LDX, and naive groups. Difficulties encountered in the recruitment process, in general, were: (a) logistical, such as scheduling issues for MRI scans due to limited scanner availability and scheduling difficulties for patients and families, many of whom lived far from the hospital; (b) constraints related to the research design, such as exclusion criteria and the challenges of complying with complex procedures on the day of scanning.</p>
      <p>In addition, 9 participants were excluded from analyses after image quality control (7 due to excessive head motion, 1 due to a marked acquisition artifact, and 1 due to large anatomical anomalies). This led to a final sample of 56 retained participants, relatively evenly distributed across the MPH, LDX, and naive groups.</p>

      <p>Across-group comparisons of functional connectivity between pairs of the 200 brain nodes extracted based on Schaefer et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) detected 30 pairs of functional connectivity which exceeded the 5% FDR threshold in at least one of the 859 simulations. All of these occurred exclusively in the contrast between LDX and NAIVE groups. Assuming that many of these nominally significant results likely represent false positives, we focus on the eight correlations that emerged in at least 5% of the simulations. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> displays the 12 brain nodes involved in these eight pairs. They represented 10 distinct brain regions, identified with their corresponding Yeo et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) networks. The nodes were predominantly located in the right hemisphere and mainly involved the frontoparietal control, attention, and default mode networks, although the somatomotor and visual networks were also represented. The box plots of average functional connectivity show that the LDX group had lower average functional connectivity in each pair than the NAIVE group; specifically, while the average functional connectivity values in these eight pairs in the NAIVE group were around zero, they were negative (i.e., anticorrelated) in the LDX group.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this exploratory study primarily designed to assess feasibility, within the constraints of a training program and with limited resources, we confirmed that it is feasible to conduct a complex brain imaging effort within a naturalistic clinical practice setting, albeit with multiple limitations. Conducting this study was an explicit learning process. The research team was aware of the main methodological threats of R-fMRI research: small sample sizes, poor data quality due to signal artifacts [in particular, head motion (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), which is greater in children with ADHD], high false positive rates [reflecting insufficiently stringent correction for multiple comparisons (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)], excessive analytic flexibility (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and lack of replicability of published research due to deficiencies in reporting (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). As the field has started to confront these problems, best practices in study reporting and transparency have been developed (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In response, publicly-funded multicenter endeavors [such as ENIGMA (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and ABCD (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)] are creating large sample sizes. In this admittedly small pilot study, we opted for stringent quality control (especially in terms of head motion corrections and exclusions), conservative statistical analyses, and transparent reporting.</p>
      <p>Given the limitations of this study, all of our results have to be considered preliminary. In particular, we cannot be confident regarding the null results in the comparisons involving the MPH group. The greater similarity in functional connectivity patterns between the MPH group and the NAIVE group than the LDX group is surprising, as the neuropharmacological and clinical effects of MPH and LDX, both stimulants, are similar. We note a lack of R-fMRI research comparing methylphenidate vs. amphetamines (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) so cannot comment further.</p>
      <p>Our preliminary results showed strengthened negative correlations (anticorrelations) across pairs of brain regions corresponding to different networks in children with ADHD who responded clinically to LDX after long-term treatment, when contrasted to treatment-naive patients. This finding is consistent with higher across-network functional segregation in patients treated with LDX, suggesting that distinct brain networks were operating with less interference from other networks than in treatment-naive patients. Such an increase in across-network functional segregation could be a neural correlate of positive clinical response to LDX in patients with ADHD. Due to the cross-sectional design and the lack of a healthy comparison sample, we cannot ascertain whether these differences between groups reflected pre-post medication changes, were markers of medication intake, mediators between medication intake and clinical response, or rather adaptive changes after clinical response.</p>
      <p>The overall tentative findings, involving diverse combinations of nodes from six different networks, are compatible with systems neuroscience approaches that highlight the role of functional network segregation in health and disease. In these models, increasing segregation reflects efficient network functioning and excessive integration can be a correlate of brain dysfunction (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). If excessive cross-network functional integration were confirmed to be a consistent feature of ADHD and related neuropsychiatric disorders, it could represent a therapeutic target of medications.</p>

      <title>Lessons Learned</title>
      <p>In terms of study design, the naturalistic approach, further constrained by difficulties encountered during its execution, has a limited ability to differentiate true pharmacological effects from other potential confounders, and in this sense is inferior to randomized controlled trials (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, this design is better suited for examining “real world” treatment responses. In addition, our cross-sectional analyses did not allow us to confirm whether across-group differences reflected true medication-induced changes. Finally, the lack of TDC individuals prevented us from formulating any tentative conclusions about the potential “normalizing” effect of medications reported in some previous studies (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) (i.e., disappearance of neuroimaging statistical differences between patients with ADHD and TDC when patients are on treatment). Nevertheless, as noted elsewhere, claims of “normalization” should be considered with caution (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
      <p>Another major limitation was the limited sample size, even if it was in line with that of most previous studies (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Small sizes have been endemic in neuroimaging research of ADHD (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and medication studies present further logistical complications for recruitment and retention of participants. This is partially offset by the within-subject analyses which increase statistical power relative to cross-sectional designs (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p>
      <p>We adopted a naturalistic design with relatively broad inclusion criteria reflecting the patients with ADHD seen in our clinic. Thus, we recruited a sample encompassing a wide age range (7–17 years), both sexes, right and left-handed individuals, and allowed certain comorbidities (learning disabilities, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety and mood symptoms and sub-diagnostic threshold autistic traits). This approach contrasts with previous studies which had narrower age ranges and/or excluded females (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The down-side of our more inclusive approach is greater heterogeneity, which also decreases statistical power.</p>
      <p>Other study limitations included inconsistencies in demographic and clinical data collected, the specific naturalistic medication scheme (which reflected clinical practice in one center), lack of mock-scanning training sessions, lack of real time monitoring of wakefulness and head motion, and flexibility of analytic pipelines (outlined in <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material</xref>) due to the exploratory nature of this study and PhD candidate training purposes.</p>
      <p>The analytic approach was robust to limit the effects of head motion and false-positive rates, two key issues in neuroimaging research of ADHD (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and the whole-brain network-based analyses afforded a big-picture perspective of brain functioning that transcends the study of isolated regions or networks. The statistically-salient results, along with the statistical uncertainty of their robustness, are transparently reported.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, the CUNMET study constituted a fruitful proof-of-concept of state-of-the-art neuropsychopharmacological research in ADHD. Despite substantial shortcomings, we demonstrated the feasibility of a naturalistic design within the constraints of real-time clinical practice and a training program, and our findings suggest that potential brain correlates of clinical response to lisdexamfetamine in children and adolescents are based in across-network segregation. The lessons learned from CUNMET are offered to inform future research and to encourage prospective investigators to undertake transparent, open-science collaborative efforts. While similar individual small studies will not advance the field on their own, their aggregation may offer frameworks for efficient exploration of designs, methods, and potential biomarkers (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) in the quest for personalized medicine in ADHD.</p>
