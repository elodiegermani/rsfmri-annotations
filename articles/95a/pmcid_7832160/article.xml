        <p id="P3">From molecular mechanisms to global brain networks, atypical fluctuations are the hallmark of neurodegeneration. Yet, traditional fMRI research on resting-state networks (RSNs) has favored static and average connectivity methods, which by overlooking the fluctuation dynamics triggered by neurodegeneration, have yielded inconsistent results. The present multicenter study introduces a data-driven machine learning pipeline based on dynamic connectivity fluctuation analysis (DCFA) on RS-fMRI data from 300 participants belonging to three groups: behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, and healthy controls. We considered non-linear oscillatory patterns across combined and individual resting-state networks (RSNs), namely: the salience network (SN), mostly affected in bvFTD; the default mode network (DMN), mostly affected in AD; the executive network (EN), partially compromised in both conditions; the motor network (MN); and the visual network (VN). These RSNs were entered as features for dementia classification using a recent robust machine learning approach (a Bayesian hyperparameter tuned Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) algorithm), across four independent datasets with different MR scanners and recording parameters. The machine learning classification accuracy analysis revealed a systematic and unique tailored architecture of RSN disruption. The classification accuracy ranking showed that the most affected networks for bvFTD were the SN + EN network pair (mean accuracy = 86.43%, AUC = 0.91, sensitivity = 86.45%, specificity = 87.54%); for AD, the DMN + EN network pair (mean accuracy = 86.63%, AUC = 0.89, sensitivity = 88.37%, specificity = 84.62%); and for the bvFTD vs. AD classification, the DMN + SN network pair (mean accuracy = 82.67%, AUC = 0.86, sensitivity = 81.27%, specificity = 83.01%). Moreover, the DFCA classification systematically outperformed canonical connectivity approaches (including both static and linear dynamic connectivity). Our findings suggest that non-linear dynamical fluctuations surpass two traditional seed-based functional connectivity approaches and provide a pathophysiological characterization of global brain networks in neurodegenerative conditions (AD and bvFTD) across multicenter data.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P4">From molecular mechanisms to global networks, variable brain fluctuations are the hallmark of neurodegeneration. RSNs can be understood as dynamical systems presenting time-dependent functional connectivity (FC) variations that influence brain function during health and disease (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Breakspear, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Sporns, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Hutchison et al., 2013</xref>). Despite this highly variable environment, most RSN research on dementia only employs static FC (SFC) measures (i.e., averages of FC across the whole MR acquisition time) (<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Sporns, 2014</xref>). Also, the field has broadly favored linear correlation measures (e.g., Pearson’s R), which are blind to non-linear connectivity interactions. These limitations may partly explain why standard SFC analyses have yielded inconsistent sensitivity and specificity indices (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Pievani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Sedeño, 2017</xref>) in classifying between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patient groups (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Pievani et al., 2014</xref>). The heterogeneous network fluctuations caused by neurodegeneration might not be captured by SFC and linear correlations, calling for non-linear FC methods and dynamical frameworks that outperform time-averaged connectivity (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Liegeois et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we developed a Dynamic Connectivity Fluctuation Analysis (DCFA) which targets FC fluctuation across time and captures both linear and non-linear signal modulations (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We tested this framework’s accuracy and generalizability to discriminate among healthy controls and two dementia subtypes (AD and bvFTD), based on 300 subjects (from three international dementia centers and online databases).</p>
      <p id="P5">Dementia involves a world-wide health-system burden, with an increasing prevalence and incidence in the US and other high-income countries (<xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>) as well as in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (<xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Kalaria et al., 2008</xref>, 9; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Parra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Ibanez and Kosik, 2020</xref>). Moreover, the neuropathology of neurodegenerative disorders may manifest differences due to varied social, cultural, and regional contexts (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Alladi and Hachinski, 2018</xref>). Functional network variability (<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Noh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Ossenkoppele et al., 2015</xref>), together with socioeconomic disparities, may induce heterogeneous presentations of AD and bvFTD, thus requiring robust approaches for its accurate characterization across heterogeneous populations. Such variability may in part explain conflicting evidence pointing to the most affected functional networks for each disease. Whereas some studies have reported that the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Salience Network (SN) are differentially affected in AD and bvFTD, respectively (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Pievani et al., 2014</xref>), others show aberrant FC along those networks in both conditions (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Agosta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Filippi et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, other networks, such as the EN, may also be disrupted in both dementia subtypes (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Agosta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Badhwar et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, there is a call for novel approaches that prove robust to sample heterogeneity.</p>
      <p id="P6">Typical resting-state FC research assumes time-constant cross-regional interaction, establishing connectivity patterns as single association coefficients between the entire time-series while ignoring temporal variations (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Hutchison et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the undeniable contribution of this approach (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Hutchison et al., 2013</xref>), increasing evidence suggests that dynamic FC (DFC) changes may add critical information about brain organization (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Breakspear, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Hutchison et al., 2013</xref>), at different time scales and frequencies (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Glover, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Yaesoubi et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, FC variability reflects task demands (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Fornito et al., 2015</xref>), learning (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Bassett et al., 2011</xref>), working memory (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Shakil et al., 2016</xref>), and different consciousness states (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Greicius et al., 2008</xref>). Dynamical fluctuations are related to specific electrophysiological bands, supporting their neurobiological relevance (Tagliazucchi et al., 2012). These changes are traceable at the typical temporal resolution of fMRI, as well as other (faster or slower) time-scales (from seconds to minutes) (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Handwerker et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, FC fluctuations seem critical to form adaptive activity patterns across different time-scales (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Hutchison et al., 2013</xref>). This could underlie the cognitive and behavioral flexibility required to tackle environmental demands –which can hardly be captured by studying encapsulated mechanisms rooted in fixed functional architectures (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Hutchison et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P7">The DFC technique proved sensitive to neurological alterations indexed by FC changes over short periods, usually considering segmented time-windows (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Shakil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Bolton et al., 2020</xref>). Most existing studies have investigated AD or Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Hutchison et al., 2013</xref>), with only one reporting reduced DFC in FTD (<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Premi et al., 2019</xref>). Previous AD research has shown alterations in the DFC of the DMN-prefrontal cortex and in global oscillatory FC patterns (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Filippi et al., 2019</xref>) correlated with cognitive symptom severity (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Demirtas et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, whereas a standard SFC approach discriminated early mild-cognitive impairment patients from controls with 62–72% accuracy, DFC yielded a higher classification rate (80%) (<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">Wee et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, this evidence presents several limitations. First, most of these studies (and others based on SFC approaches) overlook the combination of different RSNs as features to discriminate among dementias. Although the DMN and the SN are considered key altered networks in AD and bvFTD, respectively (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Pievani et al., 2014</xref>), both present aberrant FC patterns in each disease (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Agosta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Filippi et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, other networks, such as the EN, have also been reported as impaired in these conditions (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Agosta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Badhwar et al., 2017</xref>). Second, FC associations are generally estimated with linear metrics such as Pearson’s correlations, despite substantial evidence highlighting the relevance of non-linear FC (<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Moguilner et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, the reliability and reproducibility of DFC findings remains a challenge given the lack of multicenter studies using computational decision-support methods, a robust framework to identify consistent biomarkers across countries (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Humpel, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P8">Against this background, we developed a novel DCFA framework and tested whether features based on connectivity fluctuations discriminate between AD and bvFTD across countries. Innovatively, this approach estimates interregional FC variability with a metric that captures both linear and non-linear associations, outperforming traditional seed-based functional connectivity metrics to characterize dementia (<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Moguilner et al., 2018</xref>). To evaluate the robustness of our pipeline, we employed an advanced machine-learning algorithm, the gradient boosting machines (GBM) (tuned by Bayesian hyperparameter optimization), with large training and test sets comprising 300 subjects from three international dementia centers and online databases. This allows testing the generalizability of our results, which proves critical for developing timely, cost-effective, and robust biomarkers (<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Sedeño, 2017</xref>). Moreover, unlike previous research, our approach allows assessing whether global brain dynamics (i.e., combinations between RSNs) proves more informative than single-network features. Considering the evidence above, we predicted that our DCFA pipeline would outperform SFC and linear DFC models in characterizing patients across centers. Furthermore, we hypothesized that models that factor in the combinations between fluctuations of two RSNs would outperform those targeting each network separately. In particular, in light of previous findings, we hypothesized that the combinations between the SN, the DMN, and the EN would be crucial to classify between bvFTD and AD patients, and also between the latter two groups and healthy controls. Lastly, as a complementary multimodal evaluation, we performed a one-sample comparison of DCFA and SFC relative to traditional anatomical MRI measures (surface-based morphometry, SBM).</p>

Then, each case was reviewed in a multidisciplinary clinical meeting involving cognitive/behavioral neurologists, psychiatrists, and neuropsychologists.

        <p id="P13">For each preprocessing step, DPARSF called the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 12) and the Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST V.1.7) to process the data. Before preprocessing, the first five volumes of each subject’s resting-state session were discarded to ensure steady state magnetization. Then, the images were slice-time corrected (using as reference the middle slice of each volume) and aligned to the first scan of the session to correct head movement. To reduce the effects of motion and physiological artifacts, six head-motion parameters, as well as white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signals, were removed as nuisance variables. WM and CSF masks for this procedure were derived from the tissue segmentation of each subject’s T1 scan in native space. Next, functional images were normalized to the MNI space using the echo-planar imaging (EPI) template from SPM (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner and Friston, 1999</xref>), and then they were smoothed with an 8-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Finally, data was band-pass filtered (0.01–0.08 Hz) given the relevance of slow frequency in the analysis of resting-state networks (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Raichle, 2009</xref>).

        <title>Data cleaning</title>
        <p id="P14">To ensure that algorithms are fed with appropriate training data, and as a complement to the standard pre-processing pipeline described in <xref rid="S5" ref-type="sec">Section 2.3</xref>, we further cleaned the BOLD fMRI time series by despiking the signal with a wavelet-based algorithm (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1. B</xref>). This spatially-adaptive, wavelet-based method for identifying, modeling, and removing non-stationary events in fMRI time series caused by head movement is able to accommodate the substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity of motion artifacts. Therefore, this procedure can remove a range of high- and low-frequency artifacts from fMRI time series, which may be linearly or non-linearly related to physical movements. The Wavelet Despiking algorithm comprises five key steps. First, each voxel time series is decomposed in the wavelet domain. Second, the maximum and minimum wavelet coefficients are defined. Third, the maximum and minimum coefficients of the decomposition are searched, as abrupt changes in time series are represented as chains of maximal and minimal wavelet coefficients. Then, the maximum and minimum coefficients are set to zero. Finally, after the spikes have been removed, the wavelet despiked (denoised) signal is recomposed into the time-series space by using the inverse wavelet transform. Importantly, wavelet denoising yields more robust results than traditional filters, such as time despike methods (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

Then, we applied the standard deviation statistic to the values of each segment to assess the amount of fluctuation present in the RSN connectivity. Since this approach was employed in each of the segmented time series, considering five different time scales (i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 time-points) for five different RSNs (DMN, SN, EN, MN and VN), we obtained a total of 25 features per subject (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1.

        <title>Machine learning classification</title>
        <p id="P19">For our analysis within Country-1, and in order to obtain an independent test set to evaluate the generalizability of our model, we first split in half the dataset to create a training and testing set. Then, within the training sample, we performed a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme for hyper-parameter tuning. After the model was trained and cross-validated in this training sample, we evaluated the results in the other half of the data set which is independent from the training set. The following analysis involved training the model with the whole dataset corresponding to Country-1 to predict classification in the other two datasets (from Country-2 and Country-3). We have used the online database as a full out-of-sample validation, having an independent sample not only for testing, but also for training, with the aim to confirm the model’s reproducibility from scratch by arriving to the same conclusions starting from different training sets (<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2015</xref>). Then, we trained the model with the whole dataset corresponding to Country-1 to predict classification in the other two datasets (from Country-2 and Country-3). We then used an independent training and test set from the online database, where each sample (i.e., controls, AD, and bvFTD groups) was divided in two groups, resulting in one half for training and one half for testing. We used a GBM classifier library called XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting), a classification algorithm employed in fMRI analysis. Compared to other algorithms, XGBoost proves more robust and is less affected by irrelevant and redundant features (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2019</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P28">Results provide the first non-linear dynamical fluctuations pathophysiological characterization of global RSN in AD and bvFTD across multicentric data. The non-linear DFCA yielded a better classification between controls, AD, and bvFTD across centers compared to canonical connectivity approaches (including both static and linear dynamic connectivity). The classification accuracy ranking showed that the SN-EN pair offered the best classification between bvFTD and controls; whereas the DMN-EN pair provided the highest classification between AD and controls; and the SN-DMN pair offered the best classification between bvFTD and AD. Previous evidence suggests that bvFTD targets the SN, a network responsible for social-emotional-autonomic processing, and networks comprising the executive abilities (<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Ranasinghe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Ibanez and Manes, 2012</xref>; Baez et al., 2014; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Baez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Baez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Baez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">García-Cordero, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">García-Cordero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Ibáñez, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Ibáñez et al., 2017</xref>). As regards AD, disruptions of DMN, a network associated with autobiographic memory and hubs affected in AD, have been reported in mild cognitive decline and AD (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Grieder et al., 2018</xref>), along with EN alterations (<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Our results show that these networks were affected in each condition following the ranking of expected compromise. When comparing bvFTD with AD, divergent network connectivity patterns emerged between the DMN and the SN, consistent with known reciprocal network combinations and the strength and deficit profile of each disorder (<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, distinct MRI atrophy patterns in regions associated with the DMN and the SN discriminate between these dementias, with a similar anatomical involvement measured as FDG-PET hypometabolism (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Foster et al., 2007</xref>), and in amyloid ligand Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) (<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Rabinovici et al., 2011</xref>). Here, network combinations afforded higher classification accuracy, suggesting that the pathophysiological profile of specific dementia types involves a distributed pattern of fluctuating RSNs rather than disruptions of a single, static, linear network. The classification accuracy ranking analysis enabled us to weigh each RSN combination, yielding the expected relevance for AD and bvFTD, with other networks (e.g., MN and VN) emerging as noncontributing factors for classification. Higher classification accuracy was obtained when training with the whole Country-1 dataset and testing with the Country-2 and Country-3 datasets, in comparison with training with half Country-1 dataset and testing with the other half. As in the latter case we used a smaller training dataset, subtle differences can be observed in an under-fitting model, thus resulting in (relatively) lower classification scores. Notably, the results of this data-driven approach were consistent despite heterogeneous acquisitions.</p>
      <p id="P29">Unlike previous methods, our data-driven machine-learning approach showed a disease-specific disturbance of dynamic temporal fluctuations in key RSNs, providing insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of bvFTD and AD. Previous studies have adopted temporally stationary characterization of the SN in bvFTD (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Pievani et al., 2014</xref>) and the DMN for AD (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Agosta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Greicius et al., 2004</xref>). The dynamic temporal nature of brain activity, as revealed via fMRI time-series fluctuations, should be affected differentially by aging and neurodegeneration. Even while assuming that RSNs are static in the spatial domain, our report taps on brain dynamics using static parcellations of brain networks, as done before (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Deco et al., 2017</xref>; Tagliazucchi et al., 2012; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Glomb et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Ipiña, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Stevner et al., 2019</xref>). Atypical fluctuations are a basic outcome in neurodegeneration at different levels across different mechanisms (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Fornito et al., 2015</xref>). Findings suggest pathophysiological fluctuations in neurodegeneration, as already described at different levels, including neuroligins and neurexins, histaminergic, proteome, copper, and metabolic perturbations, as well as white matter, neural synchrony, and global brain dynamics (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Filippi et al., 2019</xref>). These multilevel mechanisms, from molecular to large-network assemblies, may potentially have an effect on the dynamical network fluctuations of neurodegeneration.</p>
      <p id="P30">We found that inclusion of FC fluctuations increased classification accuracy for each dementia subtype. Previous studies showed that differences in brain meta-state dwell time, particularly in DMN states, is a hallmark of AD. Decreased global metastability between functional networks indicates that oscillatory patterns are progressively altered over the AD continuum (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Demirtas et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, there is a decline of DFC fluctuations in aging (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), and the disruption of DMN dynamics increases cognitive impairment (<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">Wee et al., 2016</xref>). In FTD, diminished fluidity has been shown for transitioning between brain states (<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Premi et al., 2019</xref>). Such switching in everyday life may be associated with the fluctuations of a self-organized DFC system, providing the healthy neural substrate needed for cognitive tasks (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Deco and Corbetta, 2011</xref>). Computational modelling has shown that FC fluctuations represent a fundamental emergent feature of large-scale dynamics that supports flexible cognition (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Deco and Corbetta, 2011</xref>). Thus, abnormal transient activity of RSNs may provide relevant information for detecting neurodegeneration.</p>
      <p id="P31">Traditional DFC analyses using time windows are based on linear correlations. Non-linear relationships have been observed between gray matter atrophy (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Gispert et al., 2015</xref>) and disease severity. EEG/MEG-derived Synchronization Likelihood (SL) has shown linear and non-linear abnormalities on long-range networks in dementia (<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Stam et al., 2006</xref>). Other non-linear measures based on mutual information have proven robust to better characterize brain networks in FTD (relying on both EEG (Dottori et al., 2017) and fMRI (<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Moguilner et al., 2018</xref>) data). Unlike all these antecedents, in which the measured parameters were fixed for specific contexts, we developed a data-driven pipeline without using any a-priori parameter such as a specific window length or specific RSN disturbance using a Bayesian hyperparameter optimized XGBoost algorithm, enabling us to obtain more generalizable results.</p>

        <p id="P32">While the classification accuracy ranking of RSNs was similar between measures, higher non-linear DCFA scores were obtained across different groups and datasets (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary information 9</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">10</xref>) when compared to linear DCFA and SFC. Multi-centric approaches on diverse populations are needed to find robust and effective biomarkers of global applicability (<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Sonnen et al., 2008</xref>). Population heterogeneity may be underrepresented when local datasets are exclusively employed, especially when using data from high-income countries[12]. Developing countries have unique interactions between genetics, environmental factors and socioeconomical status (<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Parra et al., 2018</xref>). There is an ongoing need for accurate dementia markers to complement traditional clinical work (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Alladi and Hachinski, 2018</xref>). Differential diagnosis between AD and bvFTD may prove difficult, as bvFTD could frequently be misdiagnosed as AD, especially in clinical contexts where the costly PET amyloid and CSF markers are not readily available in LMIC (Piguet et al., 2011). Major challenges in neuroradiological protocol design initiatives in LMIC also involve the lack of expertise to perform standardized pre-processing and accurate image interpretation (<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Schnack et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Baez and Ibanez, 2016</xref>). Against this background, our data-driven machine learning DCFA pipeline brings a first step to include dynamical networks in the set of complementary, innovative, and affordable tools for decision-support diagnostic tools.</p>

        <title>Limitations and future studies</title>
        <p id="P33">Our work features some limitations. First, AD and bvFTD diagnoses were based on clinical expertise but without pathological or genetic confirmation. However, the diagnostic criteria for both AD and bvFTD fulfilled standard diagnostic guidelines. This limitation is shared by similar works employing traditional statistical and machine-learning techniques to study dementia (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly-Kehoe, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). Also, even when the results suggest robust classification despite absent definite diagnosis, future studies may combine confirmative biomarkers to evaluate the effectiveness of neuroimaging metrics. Second, our work focused on functional connectivity, leaving the evaluation of the combination between fMRI and structural (MRI) or metabolic PET imaging for future studies. The objective of this work was to compare the DFCA of functional connectivity fluctuations with traditional seed-based FC measures. Although this excludes multimodal comparisons with atrophy measures, which have been done before (<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Sedeño et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly-Kehoe, 2019</xref>), we performed a complementary analysis with atrophy-based classification outcomes (See <xref rid="S17" ref-type="sec">Section 3.4</xref>, and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). While the use of atrophy features provided significantly higher classification results than SFC as previously reported (<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Sedeño et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly-Kehoe, 2019</xref>), these were not significantly different from those obtained through dynamical fluctuation features. Future studies may combine atrophy features with dynamic connectivity as well as other imaging modalities for multimodal classification. While acknowledging the relevance of combining multimodal imaging, the economic constraints in low-income countries may pose difficulties in employing combined or costly biomarker protocols, such as those advanced in the NIA/AA <italic>β</italic>-Amyloid and pathologic tau PET framework (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Jack et al., 2018</xref>). However, MR functional methods may be as effective as other biomarkers in providing early diagnosis (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Iturria-Medina et al., 2016</xref>). Third, no heart rate and respiration measures were available during acquisition, which may have potentially confounded our results if groups differed significantly in this regard. Although this limitation is shared by similar works in neurodegeneration (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Grieder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Filippi et al., 2013</xref>), further studies should include the physiological rhythms (cardiac rhythm, respiration) as potential features in the machine learning classification. Fourth, although we found a specific set of best performing RSN features as a consistent marker across samples for each classification, we did not systematically assess the statistical significance among all results, as the scope of this work is to generate a data-driven model, rather than performing statistical hypothesis testing. Therefore, we did not prove the statistical significance of the feature within ranking itself, but we can assess the reproducibility of the results regarding the best performing features across datasets. Lastly, future longitudinal assessments using the present approach may unveil how dynamic network fluctuations unfold over the course of each disease.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p id="P34">Although linear, static, averaged FC methods have been proposed as potential biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Pievani et al., 2014</xref>), inconsistent results (<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Dopper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Balthazar et al., 2014</xref>) and current evidence pointing to dynamical fluctuations in health and disease (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Breakspear, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Hutchison et al., 2013</xref>) call for a different approach. Our study shows that dynamical brain fluctuations boost dementia classification, providing a data-driven hierarchical model of brain network profiles that mirrors the expected pathophysiological compromise in AD and bvFTD across heterogeneous acquisition contexts. Neural signals continuously combine, dissolve, and reconfigure to produce adaptive patterns of activity over various time scales, producing a repertoire of multi-stable brain states. Our findings provide insights into specific dynamical perturbations of oscillatory brain network architecture in dementias, leading to more plausible biological models, better disease characterization, and, eventually, more targeted drug treatments.</p>

Then we used standard masks to identify the voxels for each network. <bold>(E)</bold> We spatially averaged the voxels to obtain one RSNs time series for each network. Then we used the standard deviation statistic to obtain the fluctuation features for later normalization. <bold>(F)</bold> For testing different feature combinations, we used a LOOCV validation scheme for Bayesian hyper-parameter tuning to obtain trained XGBoost models, and then we tested our classification with independent datasets. For ROC analysis, we defined bvFTD group as the “positive ” class and AD group as the “negative ” class, allowing the sensitivity and specificity metrics being applicable to patients groups comparisons, as reported previously (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Caso et al., 2012</xref>).
