Study,Subjects,Main findings
???,22 people with RRMS14 HC,"Compared to HC, people with MS showed increased TVC in parietal regions and decreased TVC in prefrontal regions and amygdala"
???,34 people with RRMS34 HC,"Brain entropy was increased in people with MS vs HC in motor, executive control, coordination and memory regions; increased entropy correlated with higher clinical disability"
???,31 people with MS31 HC,"Compared to HC, people with MS had greater TVC, especially in the salience and nociceptive network. Abnormal TVC correlated with the presence of neuropathic pain"
???,55 people with RRMS15 HC,People with MS had lower network variations but higher flexibility of interhemispheric connections vs HC. A higher connectivity dynamism was associated with better cognitive scores
???,29 people with MS18 HC,TVC of the DMN was increased in the task vs resting condition in people with MS compared to HC. Such increase was associated with better information processing speed scores
???,38 people with MS29 HC,Decreased TVC in the hippocampus was associated with better cognitive performances at different memory tests
???,22 people with RRMS22 HC,"People with MS showed increased TVC between attention networks, but decreased TVC within attention networks, which was correlated with a higher lesion load"
???,87 people with CI MS (MCI was excluded)180 people with CP MS96 HC,"CI versus CP MS showed reduced centrality dynamics in DMN, FPN and visual networks. DMN and visual dynamics were anti-correlated in HC, but this was lost in CI"
???,62 people with RRMS65 HC,"People with CI MS had reduced TVC between subcortical network and DMN compared to CP MS, and spent less time in a connectivity state characterized by high FC strength"
???,50 people with CIS13 HC,"People with CIS exhibited decreased TVC in networks hit by the clinical attack, and increased FC dynamism over two-years of follow-up"
???,25 people with RRMS41 HC,"In people with MS, higher stationary and dynamic interhemispheric FC between homologous regions was associated with higher scores at different neuropsychological tests"
???,41 people with MS46 HC,"Increased TVC in sensorimotor and cognitive networks was found in people with MS following two weeks of action-observation training and, to a lesser extent, following control training"
???,35 people with RRMS19 HC,"People with MS had higher global TVC compared to HC; in MS, TVC strength between the basal ganglia and DMN explained the presence/absence of fatigue"
???,128 people with MS40 HC,"People with MS exhibited overall lower TVC, but also marginal increase of TVC in sensorimotor and cognitive networks vs HC in middle/highly connected states. TVC abnormalities were more severe in progressive MS and in CI MS people"
???,22 people with progressive MS25 HC,Reduced TVC in the anterior DMN and increased TVC in the executive control network was found in people with progressive MS compared to HC. Decreased anterior DMN TVC explained cognitive disability
???,278 people with MS41 HC,"SPMS showed cerebellar connectivity changes, compared to RRMS and HC, including lower static FC in the fronto-parietal network and DMN, and higher TVC in dorsal and ventral attention, DMN and deep grey matter networks. Cerebellar atrophy and higher TVC explained disability and cognitive variance"
