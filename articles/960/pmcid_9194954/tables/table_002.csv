Study,Subjects,Main findings
???,13 people with MS14 HC,"Increased RS FC was seen for many networks, no decrease. MSFC was related to increased FC of fronto-parietal and salience networks"
???,85 people with MS40 HC,"MS showed decreased RS FC within and between many networks, but also increased FC of executive control and auditory networks. Decreased RS FC was related to higher EDSS score"
???,27 people with RRMS15 people with SPMS,"Premotor RS FC was positively related to EDSS score, but in RRMS only"
???,128 people with MS50 HC,"Ventral stream decreased eigenvector centrality related to worse cognition, sensorimotor decreases related to worse EDSS scores. Regions with altered centrality showed increased thalamic RS FC"
???,26 people with MS and motor impairment17 people with MS and no motor impairment20 HC,"Right hand impairment was explored. Impaired people with MS showed lower SMN RS FC. FC was retained in a multivariate model explaining hand motor disability, assessed by using the 9HPT"
???,54 people with MS24 HC,"Dentate nucleus RS FC was higher with fronto-parietal areas in people with MS compared to HC. Increased RS FC was related to better cognition, but worse EDSS score"
???,187 people with MS94 HC,"Different thalamic subnuclei FC profiles were investigated. Increased thalamic RS FC with temporal areas was seen in people with MS and CI. Decreased thalamic RS FC with caudate and cingulate cortex was related to worse 9HPT scores, while higher thalamus-insula RS FC was related to better 9HPT scores"
???,25 people with MS and motor impairment26 people with MS and no motor impairment21 HC,"Upper limb impairment groups, evaluated using 9HPT, were explored. Support vector machines were able to distinguish subgroups based on structural and RS FC measures"
???,25 people with MS20 HC,"RS FC of the dentate nucleus was explored, showing both increased and decreased FC compared to HC. Worse balance (determined by means of center of pressure scores) was related to lower dentate-caudate RS FC"
???,121 people with early RRMS122 people with late RRMS53 people with SPMS96 HC,"Early RRMS showed no RS FC changes. Late RRMS and SPMS showed increased deep GM RS FC, which was related to both cognition and EDSS scores. SPMS showed decreased within-cortex RS FC compared to early RRMS, which was only related to EDSS scores"
???,119 people with MS42 HC,Higher frontal and lower cerebellar RS FC was related to worse EDSS scores. A peculiar contribution of cerebellar RS FC decrease was identified in multivariate models
???,215 people with MS98 HC,"MS showed a complex mixture of increased and decreased RS FC within the main large-scale networks. Lower thalamic RS FC was especially related to less severe CI, while other networks mainly showed relations of reduced FC with worse CI and EDSS/functional system scores"
???,107 people with MS50 HC,Multivariate models including RS FC were better able to distinguish MS from HC than MS subgroups based on EDSS scores. Functional measures were more important than diffusion-based measures for the classification
???,29 people with MS,"In this one-group correlation study, T25FW was related to temporo-occipital RS FC"
???,26 people with MS23 HC,Postcentral RS FC was both increased and decreased depending on which cortical area and was related to the Fugl-Meyer sensory score and EDSS score
???,180 people with MS,Subgroups based on lesion/atrophy severity indicate that patients with predominant white matter damage show increased SMN RS FC compared to those with predominant GM damage (atrophy). Lower SMN FC was related to worse EDSS
???,19 people with MS24 HC,"RS FC of specific neurotransmitter networks were related to cognitive impairment, disease duration and EDSS scores"
???,366 people with MS134 HC,Decreased RS FC was seen in people with MS compared to HC. Decreased RS FC of frontal/executive and cerebellar areas was related to 9HPT performance
???,119 people with MS42 HC,"Within-network RS FC was higher in people with MS than in HC for DMN, FPN and ECN, and was related to less severe EDSS scores, better 9HPT and T25FW scores and milder PASAT impairment. Between-network FC and whole-brain RS FC were also lower, but related to worse impairments at the same tests"
???,295 people with MS96 HC,Event-based model showed an early involvement of DMN centrality changes related to more severe EDSS scores and cognitive progression
???,20 people with MS,RS FC of areas frequently showing atrophy based on meta-analysis was evaluated. Deviation from optimal in this model was related to EDSS score
???,250 people with RRMS114 people with PMS144 HC,"RS FC related to clinical disability only in people with PMS, where increased FC of motor areas predicted EDSS. Conversely, in people with RRMS, EDSS score was only predicted by structural damage"
???,119 people with MS42 HC,"Increased cerebellar RS FC related to lower cognitive impairment and physical disability, assessed by using EDSS, 9HPT and T25FW scores"
???,185 people with MS patientsand low disability (EDSS score ≤ 3.5)37 people with MS and high disability (EDSS score ≥ 6.0)82 HC,"People with high EDSS score showed higher network efficiency (based on RS FC) of the primary sensorimotor cortex (S1), pallidum and premotor cortex, of which only S1 was significant in a multivariate model. S1 RS FC was increased with prefrontal and secondary sensory areas"
???,36 people with MS39 HC,"Thalamo-cortical RS FC was higher, while intra-thalamic FC was lower in people with MS compared to HC. Finger movement speed was impaired and related to both abnormalities of thalamic RS FC"
???,233 people with MS77 HC,"At clinical follow-up, 45% of MS patients progressed, 16% of RRMS evolved to SPMS. Decreased DMN RS FC and increased SMN RS FC predicted clinical worsening, defined basing on EDSS score increase over time. SPMS conversion was mostly predicted by GM atrophy. Adding network measures improved prediction"
???,512 people with MS161 HC,"Thalamic RS FC was explored. EDSS was related to increased thalamus-SMN FC, which was especially high in people with MS and more severe disability. Thalamic RS FC was related to cortical network atrophy, but not thalamic atrophy, nor lesions"
