          <title>Objective</title>
          <p>This study aimed to investigate the differences in intra-regional brain activity and inter-regional functional connectivity between patients with recent-onset tinnitus (ROT) and persistent tinnitus (PT) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and voxel-wise functional connectivity (FC).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Method</title>
          <p>We acquired rs-fMRI scans from 82 patients (25 without recent-onset tinnitus, 28 with persistent tinnitus, and 29 healthy controls). Age, sex, and years of education were matched across the three groups. We performed ALFF, ReHo, and voxel-wise FC analyses for all patients.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Compared with the control group, participants with ROT and PT manifested significantly reduced ALFF and ReHo activity within the left and right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and gyrus rectus (GR). Additional voxel-wise FC revealed decreased connectivity between the dorsolateral SFG (left and right) and the right superior parietal gyrus (SPG), right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and left medial superior frontal gyrus (mSFG) within these two groups. Significant differences were observed between the ROT and PT groups, with the ROT group demonstrating reduced FC.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Our data suggest that patients with PT have more difficulty monitoring external stimuli and reorienting attention than patients with ROT. In addition, patients who perceive higher levels of disruption from tinnitus are more likely to develop persistent and debilitating tinnitus once the tinnitus lasts longer than six months. Therefore, we strongly recommend that clinicians implement effective tinnitus management strategies in patients with ROT as soon as possible.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Subjective tinnitus is a conscious auditory perception without a corresponding external source and is one of the most common yet distressing otologic pathologies, affecting approximately 8–20% of the adult population (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>). Studies have reported that subjective tinnitus is commonly associated with hearing loss, cerumen impaction, middle and inner ear-related pathologies, noise exposure, exposure to ototoxic medications and chemicals, aging, insomnia, anxiety, depression, head and neck injuries, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Baguley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tunkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Makar, 2021</xref>). In addition, tinnitus can be persistent, bothersome, and costly for patients and society in general. Cases of patients with extraordinarily persistent and debilitating tinnitus accompanied by severe anxiety or depression attempting suicide have been reported (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Szibor et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is generally believed that lesions in the peripheral hearing system and neuronal changes in the central nervous system contribute to tinnitus. <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kapolowicz and Thompson (2020)</xref> reported that tinnitus might be closely related to an imbalance between auditory neuronal excitation and the inhibition network, leading to plasticity changes in the central auditory system. <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Knipper et al. (2021)</xref> proposed that hearing loss may contribute to a top-down mechanism that leads to tinnitus perception (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Knipper et al., 2021</xref>). <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al. (2021)</xref> suggested that tinnitus might be a compensatory response to peripheral hearing system damage (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2021</xref>). <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al. (2020)</xref> reported abnormal functional connectivity (FC) in the auditory and non-auditory cortices in patients with hearing loss and tinnitus (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2020</xref>). <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2019)</xref> suggested that patients with hearing loss and tinnitus demonstrate abnormal intra-regional neural activity and disrupted connectivity in the hub regions of some non-auditory networks, including the default mode network (DMN), optical network, dorsal and ventral attention network (DAN and VAN), and central executive network (CEN) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Minami et al. (2018)</xref> reported that tinnitus patients with hearing loss showed a statistically significant reduction in auditory-related FC compared with the control group. Finally, our previous project, using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and voxel-wise functional connectivity (FC) technologies, revealed that disruptions in the brain regions responsible for attention and stimuli monitoring and orientations could lead to tinnitus. Tinnitus has different forms, degrees of severity, and onset duration, which can only be described by patients’ testimony and corresponding symptoms. When categorizing tinnitus based on its onset duration (recent-onset or persistent), numerous studies have concentrated on developing pathophysiological models for chronic tinnitus (tinnitus that has an onset duration of at least six months). However, few studies have investigated the neuronal changes that occur from recent-onset to persistent tinnitus (PT) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Stolzberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lan et al., 2020</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated the aforementioned issue using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) technologies. Furthermore, investigating this issue is critical for identifying the contributing neural mechanisms and possible interventions to stop this transition. Therefore, our project aims were to uncover the differences in brain activity between recent-onset tinnitus (ROT) patients and PT patients using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) technologies and to apply our findings to existing tinnitus management strategies.</p>

        <title>Participants’ demographic and clinical information</title>
        <p>This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University. All participants provided written informed consent before participating in the study. We recruited 82 participants (all right-handed, with at least eight years of education), including 25 tinnitus participants with recent-onset tinnitus (ROT), 28 tinnitus participants with persistent tinnitus (PT), and 29 healthy participants as the control group, through our outpatient clinics between September 2011 and September 2013. The patients were group matched in terms of age, sex, and education level. Twenty-five participants perceived bilateral tinnitus and the remaining, 28 participants, perceived unilateral tinnitus. We defined the time course of tinnitus (recent-onset or persistent) according to the Tinnitus Clinical Practice Guidelines of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. According to the guideline, if the overall duration of onset equals or is less than six months, tinnitus will be determined to be recent-onset. If the overall duration of onset is more than six months, tinnitus will be defined as persistent (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tunkel et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
        <p>We performed pure-tone audiometric testing (PTA at 250; 500; 1,000; 2,000; 4,000; 6,000, and 8,000 Hz) for all recruited participants. Participants with a 7-frequency PTA &lt; 25 dB HL were considered to have clinically normal hearing. In addition, we performed comprehensive tympanometry, diagnostic distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), and diagnostic auditory brainstem response (ABR) to rule out middle ear pathologies and auditory neuropathy (ANSD). Furthermore, we collected crucial information about the duration of tinnitus and presence of insomnia in all participants.</p>
        <p>To assess the distress associated with tinnitus, we distributed the Iowa version of the tinnitus handicap questionnaire (THQ) to both the ROT and PT groups. We also distributed the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaires to all participants for anxiety and depression screening (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Zung, 1971</xref>). No significant group differences were found in the patients’ gender, age, and educational background (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, we found a statistically significant difference in the THQ total score, SAS, and SDS scores between the groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants in each group are summarized in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

        <p>Imaging data using a 3.0 T MRI scanner (Siemens MAGENETOM Trio, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard head coil. All participants were provided with foam paddings and earmuffs to minimize head motion and noise exposure during the scanning process. The participants were instructed to remain calm during the scan with their eyes closed, without falling asleep or thinking of anything particular. Functional images were obtained axially using a gradient echo-planar sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast, as follows: repetition time (TR), 2,000 ms; echo time (TE), 25 ms; slices, 36; thickness, 4 mm; gap, 0 mm; field of view (FOV), 240 mm × 240 mm; acquisition matrix, 64 × 64; and flip angle (FA), 90°.</p>

        <title>Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations: Pre-processing and analysis</title>
        <p>Resting-state ALFF reflects spontaneous neural activity and yields physiologically meaningful results. Pre-processing of the ALFF images was performed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF 5.2), Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12), and MATLAB 2021b. The first ten volumes were removed from each time series to account for the participants’ adaptation to the scanning environment. Slice timing and realignment for head motion correction were performed on the remaining 175 images. Subsequently, we performed the following procedures: spatially normalized into the stereotactic space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) (resampling voxel size = 3 Ã–3 Ã–3 mm<sup>3</sup>) and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half-maximum (FWHM), de-trending, and filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz). The participants with a head motion of more than 2.0 mm displacement or a 2.0-degree rotation in the x, y, or z directions were excluded from this study.</p>
        <p>We then analyzed the ALFF data by transforming the time domain to the frequency domain using a fast Fourier transform. Next, we computed the square root of the power spectrum and averaged squared across 0.01–0.08 Hz at each voxel. The calculated average square root was used as the ALFF. Finally, the ALFF of each voxel was divided by the global mean ALFF value for standardization.</p>

        <p>Regional homogeneity calculates the synchronization of low-frequency fluctuations between a given voxel and neighboring voxels, reflecting the neural function synchronization in the local brain region. Pre-processing of ReHo images was performed using DPARSF 5.2, SPM12, and MATLAB 2021b. The first ten volumes were removed from each time series to account for the participants’ adaptation to the scanning environment. Slice timing and realignment for head motion correction were performed on the remaining 175 images. The following procedures were performed: spatial normalization into the stereotactic space of the MNI (resampling voxel size = 3 Ã–3 Ã–3 mm<sup>3</sup>), de-trending, and filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz).</p>
        <p>After the pre-processing stage, we performed the image calculation using the Kendall coefficient of concordance of the time series of a given voxel with its 27 nearest neighbors. Next, ReHo analyses were performed using DPARSF 5.2 software. The ReHo value of each voxel was standardized by partitioning the primal value using the global mean ReHo value. Finally, the data were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm FWHM for further statistical analysis.</p>

The first ten volumes were removed from each time series to account for the participants’ time to adapt to the scanning environment. Slice timing and realignment for head motion correction were then performed for the remaining 170 images. Subsequently, the procedures were carried out as follows: spatially normalized into the stereotactic space of the MNI (resampling voxel size = 3 Ã–3 Ã–3 mm<sup>3</sup>), and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm FWHM, de-trending, and filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz).

        <p>We extracted the ALFF and ReHo differences in brain regions between ROT participants and PT participants for voxel-wise FC analysis and defined them as seeds. We then used the average time series of seeds as a reference and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the average signal change of each seed and the time sequences of the other voxels in the brain. Finally, we converted the correlation coefficient to a z-value by using Fisher’s z-transformation.</p>

      <p>In the current study, we utilized various resting-state fMRI technologies, including ALFF, ReHo, and voxel-wise FC, to investigate the differences in intra-regional brain activity and inter-regional FC in patients with ROT and PT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal neuronal changes during the transition from ROT to PT using resting-state fMRI.</p>
      <p>Our findings revealed that participants with ROT and PT demonstrated abnormal intra-regional neural activity and disrupted FC. In addition, regions of some non-auditory networks including the DMN, optical network, DAN, and CEN were affected (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we discovered significant differences within the ALFF, ReHo, and FC activity levels between the ROT and PT groups, with the PT group demonstrating the lowest activity and connectivity levels among the three groups. In order to identify the differences in brain activity between recent-onset and PT participants, we explored the roles of each brain region revealed by the rs-FMRI analysis and identified possible strategies to prevent the transition from ROT to PT.</p>

        <title>Elevated activity in left gyrus rectus for persistent tinnitus patients</title>
        <p>The GR is located on the medial margin of the inferior surface of the frontal lobe. Although its specific function remains unclear, clinical reports have indicated that patients who undergo surgical removal of the GR demonstrate temporary cognitive deficits, including a reduction in memory and personality changes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Joo et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, studies using resting-state FC technologies have revealed that patients with distressful tinnitus demonstrate abnormal brain activity within the bilateral GR (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Ueyama et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Furthermore, studies have also revealed that the GR demonstrates anatomical connections with the limbic system (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lan et al., 2022</xref>). <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Du et al. (2020)</xref> reported that the GR demonstrated strong FC with the anterior, medial, and posterior orbital gyrus, SFG, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our findings revealed that participants with ROT demonstrated reduced activity levels in the GR compared with participants with PT. In addition, compared with the healthy control group, participants from both tinnitus groups demonstrated reduced GR activity levels. Therefore, these results indicate that patients with recent-onset or PT might perceive temporary cognitive decline due to disruptions in the GR. Furthermore, for patients with ROT, the level of disruption to cognitive processing due to tinnitus may be higher than that in patients with PT due to the novelty of tinnitus.</p>

        <title>Reduced activity in dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus for both recent-onset and persistent tinnitus patient</title>
        <p>Both ALFF and ReHo analyses revealed a reduction in activity level in the dorsolateral SFG on both sides in participants with PT or ROT. The results did not reveal significant differences in dorsolateral SFG activities between the recent-onset tinnitus (ROT) and PT groups. The main functions of the dorsolateral SFG are top-down processing and cognitive functions, including working memory, episodic memory, goal-driven attention, planning, problem solving, and task switching. These findings imply the role of the dorsolateral SFG in CEN manipulation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kinoshita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition, the dorsolateral SFG demonstrates FC with the DMN, especially with the precuneus. The existing literature indicates that the DMN specializes in internally oriented cognitive processes, such as conceptual processing, daydreaming, and future planning (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cloutman and Lambon Ralph, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that the dorsolateral SFG regulates the interaction between the CEN and DMN. Reduced dorsolateral SFG activity might disrupt the CEN, eventually reducing patients’ top-down attention-filtering capability. Furthermore, our results suggest that the overall duration of tinnitus does not contribute to reduced activity levels in the left and right dorsolateral SFG. Tinnitus patients can perceive difficulties switching their attention away from the tinnitus, regardless of experiencing recent-onset or PT.</p>

        <title>Reduced functional connectivity between bilateral dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus and medial superior frontal gyrus in both recent-onset and persistent tinnitus participants</title>
        <p>The existing literature has revealed that the medial SFG has anatomical connections with the cingulate cortex (mainly the anterior and medial section of the cingulate cortex, ACC, and MCC) through the cingulum and that functional correlation with the MCC and the DMN (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Nagahama et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, dense connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (including the SFG) and, ACC, and MCC, have also been discovered in humans (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cloutman and Lambon Ralph, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Ueyama et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
        <p>Moreover, rs-FCs between SFG, ACC, and MCC have been reported (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cloutman and Lambon Ralph, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2021</xref>). The anatomical and functional connections between the medial SFG and anterior MCC suggest that the medial SFG is involved in cognitive control because the anterior part of the MCC is related to cognitive control, including conflict monitoring, response selection, error detection, and attention manipulation. Additionally, the medial SFG demonstrates anatomic connections with the ACC, a core node of the DMN, and a functional correlation with the DMN, suggesting that the medial SFG is critical for DMN manipulation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our findings suggest that the overall duration of tinnitus onset does not play a role in generating FC differences in the left medial SFG. Nevertheless, participants from the ROT and PT groups demonstrated reduced FC between the bilateral dorsolateral SFG and left medial superior frontal gyrus compared with the healthy control group. Therefore, we propose that reduced FC between the dorsolateral SFG and medial SFG disrupts DMN regulation, further reducing the patients’ ability to manipulate attention. Furthermore, this significant change within the top-down attention-regulating mechanism increases tinnitus perception regardless of the overall duration of tinnitus onset.</p>

        <title>Functional connectivity abnormality between bilateral dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus in both patients with recent-onset and persistent tinnitus</title>
        <p>As a critical component of the VAN, the right MFG serves as a convergence center for the DAN and VAN by working as a circuit breaker to interrupt ongoing endogenous attentional processes in the DAN and reorient attention to exogenous stimuli (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Japee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Briggs et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the right MFG actively engages in reorienting distinctive signals from unexpected locations (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Carter et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our findings revealed reduced FC between the dorsolateral and right MFG. This change could lead to a disruption between the VAN and DAN, which influences attention orientation to novel stimuli. This conclusion agrees with the typical description of patients with tinnitus that they unconsciously perceive their tinnitus to be more prominent in quieter situations, regardless of the tinnitus duration (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition, we also discovered that participants with tinnitus developed within six months (ROT group) demonstrated statistically higher FC than participants with PT. Participants with PT also demonstrated higher THQ, SAS, and SDS scores than participants with ROT. This result indicated that patients with tinnitus would experience more difficulties reorienting their attention away from tinnitus once it lasted longer than six months (from recent-onset to persistent).</p>

        <title>Reduced functional connectivity between bilateral dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus and superior parietal gyrus in both recent-onset and persistent tinnitus participants</title>
        <p>The main functions of the SFG are spontaneous attention regulation and top-down processing. The existing literature suggests that the SPG becomes more active during a task-free resting-state. Since the SFG acts as a critical component of the superior parietal lobule (SPL), it demonstrates a strong connection with the occipital lobe and involves somatosensory and visuospatial stimulus integration, written language, and working memory (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Berlucchi and Vallar, 2018</xref>). The existing literature also reported SPG’s implications of SPG in shifting attention between visual targets and spatial-related attention shift states (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings revealed no significant differences between the FC levels in the ROT and PT groups. However, both groups demonstrated reduced FC compared with the healthy control group. Thus, this finding indicates that reduced FC between the dorsolateral SFG and SPG could disrupt working memory in patients with tinnitus, regardless of tinnitus duration.</p>

        <title>Clinical significance of our findings in tinnitus management</title>
        <p>The existing literature indicates that the level of tinnitus distress within six months of the initial onset predicts the long-term level of tinnitus distress in patients after six months of onset. Patients who perceive higher levels of tinnitus disruption are more likely to develop persistent and debilitating tinnitus. Multiple findings from our study indicate that patients with ROT demonstrate reduced capability of top-down attention and stimuli monitoring and orientation. Therefore, clinicians should provide effective tinnitus management strategies for patients with ROT (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kleinstäuber and Weise, 2020</xref>).</p>
        <p>Considering that the cause of tinnitus can be multifactorial, there is no standard treatment plan for tinnitus. Nevertheless, clinicians can effectively manage tinnitus using multidisciplinary options. According to clinical practice guidelines for tinnitus from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, patient education and counseling, hearing amplification, sound therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy should be implemented individually or in combination for tinnitus management (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tunkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Zenner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Osuji, 2021</xref>).</p>

        <title>Research limitations and room for improvement</title>
        <p>The small sample size of our study may have reduced our ability to detect causal relationships between abnormal connectivity patterns and tinnitus characteristics. Therefore, studies with a larger sampling size are strongly recommended. Furthermore, subjects were exposed to equipment noises during the scanning process. Even though noise cancelation was instrumented in all subjects, scanner noise may reduce subjects’ tinnitus levels, thereby changing rs-FC status. Therefore, reducing the noise of brain imaging equipment will be helpful in future tinnitus-related investigations.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Our project indicated a reduced activity level within the dorsolateral SFG (left and right) and GR using ALFF and ReHo analyses. Patients with PT demonstrated higher activity levels in the GR than those with ROT. Furthermore, our follow-up voxel-wise FC revealed decreased connection activity between the dorsolateral SFG (left and right) and right SPG, right MFG, and left mSFG for participants with ROT and PT, compared to the healthy control group. Patients with ROT demonstrated a higher level of FC than those with PT did. Our data suggest that patients with PT are more likely to experience difficulties in monitoring external stimuli and attention reorientation than patients with ROT. In addition, patients who perceive higher levels of tinnitus disruption are more likely to develop persistent and debilitating tinnitus. Therefore, we strongly recommend that clinicians implement effective tinnitus management strategies in patients with ROT as soon as possible.</p>
