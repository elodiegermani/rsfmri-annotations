        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Thorough assessment of cerebral dysfunction after acute lesions is paramount to optimize predicting clinical outcomes. We here built random forest classifier-based prediction models of acute motor impairment and recovery post-stroke. Predictions relied on structural and resting-state fMRI data from 54 stroke patients scanned within the first days of symptom onset. Functional connectivity was estimated via static and dynamic approaches. Motor performance was phenotyped in the acute phase and 6 months later. A model based on the time spent in specific dynamic connectivity configurations achieved the best discrimination between patients with and without motor impairments (out-of-sample area under the curve, 95% confidence interval: 0.67 ± 0.01). In contrast, patients with moderate-to-severe impairments could be differentiated from patients with mild deficits using a model based on the variability of dynamic connectivity (0.83 ± 0.01). Here, the variability of the connectivity between ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex and putamen discriminated the most between patients. Finally, motor recovery was best predicted by the time spent in specific connectivity configurations (0.89 ± 0.01) in combination with the initial impairment. Here, better recovery was linked to a shorter time spent in a functionally integrated configuration. Dynamic connectivity-derived parameters constitute potent predictors of acute impairment and recovery, which, in the future, might inform personalized therapy regimens to promote stroke recovery.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in adults<xref rid="fcab227-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and entails the highest number of disability-adjusted life years among more than 300 different diseases.<xref rid="fcab227-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> To optimize stroke care, it is of great importance to establish prediction models of stroke-related disabilities at the single patient level. These predictions may not only inform patients and their proxies about individual trajectories after stroke, but may also facilitate the allocation and planning of targeted rehabilitative regimens.</p>
      <p>The amount of initial motor impairment has been frequently demonstrated to constitute a strong predictor of chronic impairment,<xref rid="fcab227-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> yet may not guarantee sufficiently accurate predictions at the level of single patients.<xref rid="fcab227-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> This limitation motivates the consideration of further biomarkers of stroke recovery.<xref rid="fcab227-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> While structural and functional neuroimaging-derived information have proven viable candidates, only a few studies have been published aiming at predicting motor recovery as a long-term outcome.<xref rid="fcab227-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6–8</sup></xref> Novel techniques permit the increase in the temporal resolution of MRI resting-state functional connectivity maps from minutes to seconds, thereby offering a new vista on the neural mechanisms driving functional recovery<xref rid="fcab227-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9–11</sup></xref> We have recently shown that dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analyses provide new information on cerebral alterations post-stroke, thus far hidden in conventional resting-state analyses that assume static connectivity between brain regions.<xref rid="fcab227-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Several studies suggest that dFNC may not only enhance inferences in imaging correlates of brain disease, but also lead to substantial increases in predictive capacities for several of these diseases, potentially as the dynamic approach may to be closer to the neurobiology underlying brain function.<xref rid="fcab227-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13–15</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Therefore, we here sought to explore the potential of dFNC parameters for predicting acute motor impairment and recovery after stroke, as well as for granting further insights into pathophysiological cerebral mechanisms post-stroke. We hypothesized that dFNC parameters obtained in the acute post-stroke phase are superior to static connectivity for predicting motor outcome, as neural reorganization enabling recovery of function might especially depend on the dynamic flexibility of neural network.<xref rid="fcab227-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Furthermore, we expected enhanced prediction performances for dFNC-informed models compared to those that solely employed clinical predictors, such as an initial impairment score, or structural lesion information.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>Fifty-four patients admitted to the University Hospital of Cologne, Department of Neurology, due to acute first-ever ischaemic stroke participated in this study (c.f., <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary materials</xref> for inclusion criteria, first assessment on average three days after stroke onset). For <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 30 patients, follow-up visits could be scheduled on average 30 weeks after the ischaemic event. Patients received rehabilitation measures, e.g. physiotherapy and occupational therapy, according to general standards in Germany. All patients received some form of physical and/or occupational therapy for at least three weeks. Patients with persistent deficits usuallycontinue to receive one to two 30-minutes sessions of out-patient rehabilitation therapy per week. The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all patients provided informed written consent following the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>

        <title>Motor performance and recovery</title>
        <p>Upper limb motor performance was tested twice: at the time of scanning (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 54), i.e. in the acute post-stroke phase and at follow-up six months later. Individual motor performance was captured via the Motricity Index of the affected upper limb (MI-UL,<xref rid="fcab227-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> c.f., <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Patients were categorized in three subgroups depending on the level of motor impairment: (i) patients with no upper limb impairment (MI-UL = 33, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 26); (ii) patients with mild impairments (25 ≤ MI-UL ≤ 32, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 16); and (iii) patients with moderate-to-severe upper limb motor impairment (MI-UL ≤ 22, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12). The cut-off between mildly and moderate-to-severely affected patients was chosen based on the sample distribution of MI-UL scores of patients with impairments and a median score of MI-UL = 25.3. As a consequence, patients in the moderate-to-severe group featured an MI-UL of maximal 22. Given that three movements were tested, i.e. shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and pinch grip, MI-UL scores below or equal to 22 could arise from varying combinations of motor impairments, e.g. the inability for all three movements of performing them against gravity or more severe limitations of one movement, e.g. no hand movement, but visible movements for shoulder abduction and elbow flexion. In any case, at least one of the tested movements could necessarily not be performed against resistance, which may be seen equivalent to a clinically relevant motor deficit.</p>
        <p>Recovery was quantified as change between follow-up and acute motor impairment (MI-UL<sub>Follow-up—</sub>MI-UL<sub>acute</sub>). In particular, we defined three subgroups which differed in the amount of experienced motor recovery: (i) no change in motor function (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 16, no change could be due to no initial impairment or no change between initial and follow-up impairment); (ii) more (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 9); and (iii) less pronounced recovery (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5). The cut-off between more and less pronounced recovery was based on the median amount of recovery in the sample of all patients with an initial impairment (recovery = 7.7 MI points). The difference between the two adjacent MI categories, i.e. ‘palpable contraction, but no movement’ versus ‘visible movement, but full range and not against gravity’ or ‘Full movement against gravity, but weaker than on the other side’ and ‘Normal power’, is on average 6.6 points. Our cut-off value of 7.7 hence represents a noticeable and relevant amount of recovery.</p>

        <title>MRI acquisition</title>
        <p>Resting-state fMRI data were acquired in the framework of a clinical imaging protocol in a clinical routine on a 1.5 T scanner (Philips, Guildford, UK). Patients were asked to lie motionless in the scanner and stay awake. Gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) parameters were as follows: repetition time (TR)=2100 ms, echo time (TE)=50 ms, field of view (FOV)=250 mm, 24 axial slices, voxel size: 3.9 × 3.9 × 3.9 mm<sup>3</sup>, 183 volumes, acquisition time: ∼six minutes. We, furthermore, obtained the following structural scans: diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) images (TR = 3900 ms, TE = 95 ms, FOV = 230 mm, 22 axial slices, voxel size = 1.8 × 3 × 6 mm<sup>3</sup>) and T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MR-images (TR = 5600 ms, TE = 110 ms, FOV = 230 mm, 22 axial slices, voxel size = 0.9 × 1.1 × 6.0 mm<sup>3</sup>) for more detailed analyses of lesion topography. Images of patients with right-hemispheric lesions (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 19) were flipped at the midsagittal plane.<xref rid="fcab227-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="fcab227-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> As a consequence, no conclusions on hemispheric-specific effects can be drawn with respect to motor recovery.</p>

        <title>Structural MRI analysis</title>
        <p>Stroke lesion maps were constructed by manually segmenting lesioned tissue on DWI images using MRIcron.<xref rid="fcab227-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Subsequently, DWI images, as well as corresponding lesion masks, were normalized to standard MNI-space by first co-registering images to an MNI-template and then employing the unified segmentation algorithm after masking infarcted tissue.<xref rid="fcab227-B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Lesion maps of 53 patients passed quality control (in one subject top slices were missing due to an alignment error during DWI volume acquisition). In a subsequent step, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the high-dimensional lesioned voxel-space (9900 voxels lesioned in at least one subject).

        <title>Resting-state fMRI analysis: pre-processing</title>
        <p>Resting-state fMRI data were pre-processed employing Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8; <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>) in a Matlab framework (The Mathworks 2012a, Natick, MA, USA). As for one subject, only 182 images were acquired, we shortened all further time courses by one volume to harmonize the scan length across subjects. The first three volumes of each time-series were discarded to allow for blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-signal saturation.</p>
        <p>The 179 remaining images were spatially realigned to the time-series’ mean image and co-registered with the structural image and corresponding lesion mask. Subsequently, all images were spatially normalized to standard MNI-space using the unified segmentation option after masking lesioned brain tissue. In a final step, data were smoothed by a Gaussian kernel with a full-width at half maximum of 8 mm. For each patient's time series, maximum framewise translation and framewise rotation did not exceed 3 mm and 0.05 rad, respectively, similar to previous work.<xref rid="fcab227-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Moreover, individual motion parameters were integrated as covariates in later analyses.</p>

        <title>Statistical analyses II: Prediction of acute motor impairment and motor recovery</title>
        <p>The main aim of the present study was to build robust prediction models of acute individual motor impairment and recovery within the first months post-stroke based on neuroimaging data acquired in the acute post-stroke phase.</p>
        <p>We created two classification scenarios: We aimed at (i) predicting the acute motor deficits from fMRI data acquired in the acute post-stroke phase and (ii) predicting motor recovery. With respect to the first scenario, we initially sought to determine whether it is possible to predict whether a stroke patient has or doesn't have a motor deficit using the MI-UL score. In addition, we tested whether it is also possible to predict the severity of motor impairment, i.e. whether an individual patient had a mild versus a moderate-to-severe impairment of the upper limb. Given that acute impairment itself can, in principle, be determined via clinical assessment in a few minutes without the necessity to employ any prediction algorithm, the main focus of these initial analyses was to extract predictive features with potential pathophysiological meaning, facilitating a greater neuroscientific insight. With respect to the second prediction scenario, we aimed to predict motor recovery, i.e., the change between the follow-up six months post-stroke and the acute MI-UL-score. As we considered three categories of motor recovery (no motor recovery, minor recovery, substantial recovery), we extended previous two-class prediction scenarios to a multi-class prediction one. In an exploratory analysis, we also computed a prediction model to differentiate between patients with minor to no recovery (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 8) and patients with substantial recovery (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 9).</p>
        <p>A random forest classifier was used as prediction model.<xref rid="fcab227-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> This meta-estimator machine learning algorithm fits several decision tree classifiers on bootstrapped sub-samples of the dataset and successively averages individual predictions. In this way, it aims to increase prediction accuracy by reducing variance and overfitting. Moreover, random forest classifiers can automatically include non-linear and interaction effects of input variables and handle correlated input variables favourably.<xref rid="fcab227-B32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Given our moderate sample size, we accepted the possibility of slightly lower prediction performances, yet avoided an additional nested cross-validation step by adopting hyperparameter settings that were suggested by Olson et al.<xref rid="fcab227-B33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> (n_estimators = 500; criterion = ‘entropy’, max_features = 0.25). Olson et al. had extracted these settings as the most advantageous ones after running hyperparameter optimizations in 165 biomedical datasets. To obtain a performance estimate for unseen patient data, i.e. the model’s generalization capacity, we conducted 100 randomly initiated 5-fold cross-validations, repeatedly training and testing models in 100 × 5 training and test sets. In the multi-class recovery prediction analyses, we employed 3-fold cross-validation given the small subgroup sample size.</p>
        <p>The reported main performance measure denotes the out-of-sample area under the curve (AUC) and the respective 95% confidence interval, as estimated in 100 randomly initiated 5-fold cross-validations. AUC values range between 0 and 1, and values greater than an AUC = 0.5 are considered to be above chance level. Non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals between models determined significant differences between AUC outcomes. Sensitivity and specificity are given in the <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary materials</xref>. We also examined the feature importance estimated by the random forest classifier to increase the interpretability of the prediction approach and extract the potential neurophysiological meaning of input features.</p>
        <p>Concerning input features, we examined the predictive capacity of neuroimaging features derived from (i) <italic toggle="yes">structural</italic> data; (ii) <italic toggle="yes">static</italic>; and (iii) <italic toggle="yes">dynamic</italic> functional connectivity data. Structural lesion information was considered either in the 5- or 28-component PCA-reduced form. Static functional connectivity was entered as 91 network-pair-wise connectivity values. Finally, we constructed two models relying on dFNC. The first dFNC model was based on the dynamic parameters fraction and dwell times, as well as the number of transitions. The second dFNC model leveraged the variability in the dynamic connectivity of all 91 network pairs. Models were built with and without the addition of the acute motricity index when predicting the recovery after stroke.</p>

The majority of their lesions were located subcortically in middle cerebral artery territory (<xref rid="fcab227-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Five patients experienced pontine brainstem infarcts. One patient with right-hand weakness due to left-hemispheric stroke also featured punctuate embolic lesions in both cerebellar hemispheres. However, it is very unlikely that these cerebellar lesions had a relevant impact on hand motor weakness or cortico-cortical connectivity.</p>

Feature importances indicated that the total time spent in state 3, i.e. the fraction time in a functionally markedly integrated state, was the most relevant parameter for predicting the acute impairment status (c.f., <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental materials</xref> for a quantitative evaluation of integration and segregation). Dwell times in state 2, another functionally integrated state, were assigned the second highest feature importance. Both features, however, did not correlate with acute motor impairments (fraction time state 3: <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.22, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.12; dwell time state 2: <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.03, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.87), which may be indicative of more complex interaction and non-linear effects that the random forest classifier picked up on. The models based on the structural, as well as static functional connectivity data performed second-best (5-component structural: AUC = 0.61 ± 0.02, 28-component structural: AUC = 0.59 ± 0.01, static connectivity: AUC = 0.62 ± 0.02). The model considering the dynamic variability data performed significantly worse than the previous models and achieved an AUC at chance level (<xref rid="fcab227-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>However, when refining the prediction scenario to the distinction between patients with moderate-to-severe and mild motor impairments (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 28), it was the model based on dynamic connectivity variabilities that demonstrated the highest prediction capacity (AUC = 0.83 ± 0.02). The amount of motor impairment was especially predicted by the variability of dynamic connectivity between the ipsilesional sensorimotor network and bilateral posterior putamen, as well as ventral pre-central cortex and bilateral anterior putamen (<xref rid="fcab227-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Here, more severe motor impairments correlated with higher variability in these networks (ipsilesional sensorimotor network–posterior putamen: <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = −0.57, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.001, ventral pre-central cortex–anterior putamen: <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = −0.40, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.035).

        <p>In summary, the presence of acute motor impairments was best predicted by the fraction and dwell times-based dynamic connectivity model. In contrast, the variability of individual dynamic connectivity pairs was a powerful predictor of the amount of motor impairment.</p>

        <title>Prediction of motor recovery</title>
        <p>We next challenged the capacity of acutely acquired structural and rsfMRI data to predict motor recovery 6 months after stroke (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 30). The motricity index score obtained in the acute post-stroke phase was already a strong predictor, when differentiating between more and less pronounced, as well as no changes in motor function in the first six months post-stroke (AUC = 0.84 ± 0.01, all results: <xref rid="fcab227-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The joint model based on the dynamic fraction and dwell times data and the acute motricity index score accomplished a prediction performance of AUC = 0.89 ± 0.01. The 95% confidence intervals of this joint model did not overlap with the 95% confidence interval of the model using the MI as the sole predictor variable, highlighting significantly improved prediction performance when adding the dynamic connectivity parameters to the behavioural data. The two most important features were the number of transitions between states and fraction time in state 3, i.e. a functionally integrated state. The acute MI-UL score was ranked as the third most important feature only. Both of the most important dynamic connectivity parameters correlated negatively with the recovery, i.e. the more a subject recovered, the shorter their time spent in state 3 was and the fewer they switched between different states (Fraction time state 3: <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = −0.49, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.006; Number of state transitions: <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = −0.39, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.04).</p>

        <p>Finally, we tested the prediction performance when only considering patients with an initial impairment. In this scenario, the amount of recovery (no-minor versus substantial) was best predicted by the dynamic fraction and dwell times data (AUC = 0.92 ± 0.02, <xref rid="fcab227-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 4 and 5</xref>). The most important features were fraction and dwell times in state 3, i.e. a functionally integrated state (Fraction time state 3: <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = −0.56, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02; Dwell time state 3: <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = −0.61, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.008). The model relying on the initial MI-score achieved a significantly lower AUC of 0.82 (AUC = 0.82 ± 0.02). It was paralleled in performance by the models considering the variability in dynamic connectivity (with the addition of the MI-score: AUC = 0.83 ± 0.02 and without the MI-score: AUC = 0.82 ± 0.02). The two top ranked features were the variability in dynamic connectivity between SMA and bilateral posterior putamen, as well as lateral paracentral cortex and bilateral posterior putamen. Correlation analyses indicated that subjects showed higher recovery values the smaller variability was in these connections (SMA–putamen: <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = −0.59, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.01; lateral paracentral cortex–lateral paracentral cortex: <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = −0.54, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.03). While the models relying on 28-component structural and static connectivity data did not exceed a chance-level prediction performance, the model incorporating 5-component structural data had (i) an AUC of 0.72 ± 0.03 with the addition of the MI-score, and (ii) 0.66 ± 0.02 without the MI-score. This finding indicates some relevance of the stroke lesion location with respect to the potential to recover.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we found dFNC parameters obtained in the first days post-stroke such as the state-specific fraction and dwell times as well as the variability of dynamic connectivity to be potent predictors of motor recovery six months later. In particular, fraction and dwell times significantly enhanced prediction performance beyond the level of traditional and well-known clinical predictors, such as the initial motor impairment.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We here explored novel predictors of individual acute motor impairment and recovery after stroke. These biomarkers were derived from dFNC analyses of rsfMRI data from 54/30 acute ischaemic stroke patients that presented with varying degrees of motor impairment. DFNC analyses are special because they allow for the extraction of moment-to-moment fluctuations in brain connectivity and the definition of re-occurring dynamic connectivity states.<xref rid="fcab227-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="fcab227-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Thereby, this approach increases the time resolution of resting-state fMRI evaluations to seconds and may be particularly capable of capturing stroke-induced short-lasting connectivity alterations and higher network flexibility.<xref rid="fcab227-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="fcab227-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="fcab227-B34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Fraction times in state 3, i.e. the total time spent in a functionally integrated connectivity state, and the variability in dynamic connectivity between putamen and various cortical sensorimotor areas crystallized as particularly promising biomarkers for individualized outcome predictions.</p>

        <title>Functional segregation and integration</title>
        <p>Stroke patients with or without acute motor impairments were most accurately differentiated based on the time spent in specific connectivity states. Feature importance highlighted fraction times in state 3, a connectivity state that was characterized by pronounced functional integration. <italic toggle="yes">Functional integration</italic> here describes a synchronized information processing between various functional domains, while <italic toggle="yes">functional segregation</italic> implies more isolated information processing within functional domains.<xref rid="fcab227-B35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Previous studies of dynamic connectivity in two independent acute ischaemic stroke cohorts have already uncovered links between functional integration and segregation and motor performance: lower motor domain integration in case of severe compared to moderate hand motor impairments<xref rid="fcab227-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and increased whole-brain segregation (i.e. decreased integration) in case of a high stroke severity.<xref rid="fcab227-B36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Importantly, data of these two cohorts were completely non-overlapping with the present one, in particular, they were obtained in scanners with different field strengths (3 T instead of 1.5 T), at different time points or places. Interestingly, in healthy subjects with cast-induced motor inactivity of the upper limb, motor network topology also turned into a more segregated state.<xref rid="fcab227-B37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> We here did not observe a clear correlation between fraction times in integrated state 3 and acute motor impairment across all subjects. Rather, our random forest classifier approach may have enabled us to differentiate between groups by also capturing non-linear, as well as interaction effects between more than one variable.</p>
        <p>While we did not find an association between fraction times in state 3 and acute motor impairments, we did, however, identify a high capacity of the fraction and dwell times in state 3 to predict and correlate with future recovery. Patients that did not show a preference for this spatially integrated connectivity state in the first days after stroke recovered more substantially in the upcoming weeks. From a pathomechanistic perspective, the possibly most striking characteristic of state 3 is the pattern of highly positive intra-domain dynamic connectivity in combination with a positive connectivity between cortical and subcortical networks. Hence, the association of lower fraction and dwell times in state 3 with motor recovery indicates that a more segregated, isolated processing within the cortical and subcortical motor domains may be mechanistically critical for a more successful stroke recovery. Interestingly, increased segregation, i.e. decreased integration, has been previously linked to expedited regain of cognitive function in healthy ageing and diffusely damaged brains after mild traumatic brain injury.<xref rid="fcab227-B38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Our current findings are, therefore, in line with these reports.</p>

        <title>Variability of dynamic connectivity</title>
        <p>By considering the variability in dynamic connectivity, we here amend the previously employed toolset to generate insights into the role of motor areas in healthy and pathological motor function. In inference- and prediction-focussed analyses, we were able to link mild motor impairment as well as a more pronounced recovery to lower, i.e. more stable, dynamic connectivity variability values in select cortical–subcortical connections. The investigation of dynamic connectivity variability profiles was previously motivated by Allen et al.,<xref rid="fcab227-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> especially as they represented inaccessible information content when conducting static connectivity analyses. The authors described distinct ‘zones of instability’, i.e. regions with more variable dynamic connectivity in healthy volunteers: The most variable regions were located in the lateral parietal and occipital cortex. Comparable analyses of dFNC variability in neurological patients with temporal lobe epilepsy inferred the instability of precuneus dynamic connectivity as a signature of the disease.<xref rid="fcab227-B39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> In yet another study, the dFNC variability provided powerful information for the differentiation between Alzheimer’s patients and healthy controls.<xref rid="fcab227-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
        <p>In this study, it was the variability of the dynamic connectivity between the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex and bilateral posterior putamen that predicted a more versus less initial impairment especially well. Statistical group comparisons moreover suggested that, both moderately-to-severely affected patients, as well as those without any impairments had a higher ipsilesional sensorimotor-putamen dFNC variability than mildly affected patients. Both of these brain regions are well known to be implicated in the emergence of acute motor impairments and recovery post-stroke. Lesion symptom mapping studies repeatedly reported ischaemic lesions in the putamen underlying upper limb impairment.<xref rid="fcab227-B40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Furthermore, the link between lower (static) resting-state connectivity between ipsi- and contralesional motor areas and higher motor impairment is one of the most prominently featured findings in stroke neuroimaging research.<xref rid="fcab227-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="fcab227-B41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> The connectivity between the posterior ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex and putamen, let alone their dFNC variability, however, requires further exploration to determine the biological meaning.</p>
        <p>In case of predicting motor recovery, the variability of the dynamic connectivity strengths between the SMAs and the bilateral posterior parts of the putamen was the most predictive feature. This SMA–putamen variability was also found to be significantly lower in case of more pronounced recovery compared to less pronounced and no change in motor function. The SMA has been consistently identified as critical region for physiological motor function as well as for stroke recovery in previous studies.<xref rid="fcab227-B42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="fcab227-B43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> In particular, longitudinal motor-task-based functional imaging studies demonstrated a recovery-related excess in activation in these regions early after stroke<xref rid="fcab227-B42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> and decreases in activation in sub-acute and chronic stages after stroke.<xref rid="fcab227-B43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> In addition, dynamic causal modelling analyses that extracted links between increases in SMA-M1 coupling and motor improvements suggested a supportive role of SMA for motor recovery post-stroke.<xref rid="fcab227-B44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Lastly, diffusion-tensor imaging in healthy adults indicates structural connections between SMA and especially posterior parts of the putamen, highlighting the role of this connection for motor function.<xref rid="fcab227-B45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> In line with this conclusion, the SMA–putamen connectivity was found to be disturbed in patients suffering from motor impairments due to Parkinson’s disease.<xref rid="fcab227-B46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="fcab227-B47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref></p>
        <p>In summary, previous results on dFNC variability and ours combined suggest that these dFNC parameters represent biologically meaningful fingerprints of neurological diseases. In the case of ischaemic stroke, this variability might particularly well capture the effects of brain injury and early plasticity mechanism in the first few days post-stroke.</p>

        <title>Limitation and future directions</title>
        <p>A sample of 54 stroke subjects is still extendible if intended for the construction of outcome prediction models, especially as the sample size was decreased further in ancillary analyses. We obtained out-of-sample estimates of model performance via 5-fold cross-validation in all cases, as is the current recommendation in neuroimaging-based prediction studies.<xref rid="fcab227-B48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> However, future studies, relying on external, i.e. independent datasets, are warranted to test the generalizability of our findings in further depths and ensure that predictions generated from the here developed models continue to be accurate in new patient samples. These steps may then facilitate a smoother translation into the clinical routine. Of note, the present dataset is among the largest acute stroke rsfMRI datasets currently available and rendered particularly unique by its comprehensive longitudinal motor assessment and acquisition during the clinical routine, i.e. when the patients received their diagnostic MR scans. The latter circumstance enabled a very early time point of data acquisition, on average 2.5 days after stroke. This very early time point of data acquisition contrasts other larger-scale stroke imaging studies, that have recruited subjects on average two weeks after index stroke.<xref rid="fcab227-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Altogether, our study underlines the general feasibility of implementing the approach presented here with respect to clinical translation. Owing to the task-free nature of rsfMRI, it was also feasible to recruit stroke patients that are typically excluded from fMRI task studies, i.e. patients with severe motor impairment. Despite the task-free nature, it nonetheless remains essential to minimize any artefacts due to motion in the scanner, which might be particularly challenging in severely affected and also older patients.</p>
        <p>Another limitation of this study relates to the fact that we did not systematically assess the amount of rehabilitation therapy that each patient received. However, we can assume that therapy doses varied between patients given their differences in initial deficits and ensuing recovery, since the amount of rehabilitation therapy in Germany is usually decided based on the progress a patient makes. Altogether, it is therefore very difficult, if not impossible, to anticipate the exact amount of rehabilitation, that a patient will receive later. Hence, such information cannot be reliably included into prediction algorithms at the beginning of the recovery process.<xref rid="fcab227-B49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> Along these lines, we here predicted the amount of recovery based on factors, such as symptom severity and connectivity estimates, <italic toggle="yes">before</italic> rehabilitation was commenced. It thus appears likely that differences in the absolute amount of recovery were not primarily driven by differences in rehabilitation minutes.</p>
        <p>Our findings suggest that the variability of several dynamic connectivity pairs is relevant for motor impairment as well as for recovery. We were also able to extract a weak positive correlation between the overall variability of dynamic connectivity and lesion volume. It was, however, beyond the scope of the current study to determine detailed links between this variability and individual lesion locations given their large spatial variability (c.f., <xref rid="fcab227-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Such associations could, for example, be investigated further in larger samples via canonical correlation analyses<xref rid="fcab227-B50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> that aim to find joint associations between sets of variables from different modalities.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we have focused on classification scenarios, i.e. our prediction models discriminated patients with or without motor impairments. It could thus be a valuable next step to predict outcomes on continuous scales, i.e. predict the precise amount of impairment per patient. Moreover, it will be important to extend the validity of our findings based on the Motricity Index, a very quick and well validated instrument to capture motor impairments,<xref rid="fcab227-B51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="fcab227-B52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> to further frequently used impairment and activity limitation scales, such as the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the upper extremity (FU-UE)<xref rid="fcab227-B53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> or the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT).<xref rid="fcab227-B54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref> In particular, these more detailed tests may offer the possibility of specifically evaluating subgroups of patients with respect to already established minimal clinically important differences (MCID),<xref rid="fcab227-B55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> that may identify motor recovery that has a noticeable and meaningful impact on patients’ lives.<xref rid="fcab227-B49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="fcab227-B56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref> Lastly, future studies may further elucidate the interplay between behavioural and imaging-based biomarkers of stroke recovery. In the present study, the model incorporating dynamic connectivity information provided the significantly highest prediction performance. However, it has to be noted that the initial behavioural motor score itself was already an effective predictor of stroke recovery. While we may generally be interested in the highest possible prediction performance—as it can, indeed, make a difference on the level of the individual patient—this small difference in prediction performance may justify a focus on easy-to-obtain behavioural measures for prediction in case of limited resources.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Our data show that dynamic connectivity measures contain a high predictive capacity not only for acute impairments but also for the potential of recovery following stroke. Especially dynamic connectivity estimates between the putamen and cortical motor networks emerged as reliable predictors of motor impairment and recovery. In conclusion, our study highlights the value of dynamic connectivity-derived information to gain insights into the phenotypes of acute ischaemic brain injury and recovery after stroke.</p>
