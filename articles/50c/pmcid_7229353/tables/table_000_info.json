Group-averaged values of clinical and cognitive variables from the psychosis-risk calculator that entered into the prediction model. SIPS P1 and P2 scores are shown separately here to allow easy interpretation, but a combined value was used in the prediction analysis by rescaling each score down to a maximum of 3 (using 0 for values of 0\u20132) and adding the scores together.
