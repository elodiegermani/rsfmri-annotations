          <title>Background and Objectives</title>
          <p>Cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with functional connectivity abnormalities. While there have been calls to use functional connectivity measures as biomarkers, there remains to be a full understanding of why they are affected in MS. In this cross-sectional study, we tested the hypothesis that functional network regions may be susceptible to disease-related “wear and tear” and that this can be observable on co-occurring abnormalities on other magnetic resonance metrics. We tested whether functional connectivity abnormalities in cognitively impaired patients with MS co-occur with (1) overlapping, (2) local, or (3) distal changes in anatomic connectivity and cerebral blood flow abnormalities.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Multimodal 3T MRI and assessment with the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological tests were performed in 102 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 27 healthy controls. Patients with MS were classified as cognitively impaired if they scored ≥1.5 SDs below the control mean on ≥2 tests (n = 55) or as cognitively preserved (n = 47). Functional connectivity was assessed with Independent Component Analysis and dual regression of resting-state fMRI images. Cerebral blood flow maps were estimated, and anatomic connectivity was assessed with anatomic connectivity mapping and fractional anisotropy of diffusion-weighted MRI. Changes in cerebral blood flow and anatomic connectivity were assessed within resting-state networks that showed functional connectivity abnormalities in cognitively impaired patients with MS.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Functional connectivity was significantly decreased in the anterior and posterior default mode networks and significantly increased in the right and left frontoparietal networks in cognitively impaired relative to cognitively preserved patients with MS (threshold-free cluster enhancement corrected at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> ≤ 0.05, 2 sided). Networks showing functional abnormalities showed altered cerebral blood flow and anatomic connectivity locally and distally but not in overlapping locations.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Discussion</title>
          <p>We provide the first evidence that functional connectivity abnormalities are accompanied by local cerebral blood flow and structural connectivity abnormalities but also demonstrate that these effects do not occur in exactly the same location. Our findings suggest a possibly shared pathologic mechanism for altered functional connectivity in brain networks in MS.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Cognitive impairment affects about half of people with multiple sclerosis (MS).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although the disease mechanisms responsible are not fully elucidated, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies have shown differences in functional connectivity (FC) between cognitively impaired (CI) and unimpaired patients.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> However, a shortcoming of rs-fMRI, which limits the ability to interpret findings, is the lack of information about pathologic mechanisms underlying FC abnormalities.</p>
    <p>It has been proposed, in the nodal stress hypothesis, that the high activity of network regions with high connectivity, so-called hubs or nodes, makes them susceptible to pathologic wear and tear, possibly due to high metabolic demands, which could accelerate neurodegeneration, leading to network dysfunction.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
    <p>If wear-and-tear changes are responsible for FC abnormalities, we would expect to see abnormalities also on other magnetic resonance (MR) metrics. Network hubs are heavily interconnected within both functional and structural networks, and activity-related damage can be expected to affect anatomic connectivity. In addition, if nodal damage is caused by unmet metabolic demands, this could affect cerebral blood flow (CBF).<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> By collecting diffusion MRI and CBF data along with rs-fMRI images, we can establish whether FC abnormalities co-occur with white matter (WM) and perfusion changes, as would be expected under the nodal stress hypothesis. Such co-occurring abnormalities can point to shared underlying mechanisms and thus inform the direction of future research.</p>
    <p>In this study, we tested the nodal stress hypothesis in a cohort of patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) to test whether FC abnormalities in CI patients co-occur with anatomic connectivity and CBF abnormalities in (1) spatially overlapping regions within networks, (2) the same networks, or (3) distal areas from resting-state networks (RSNs).</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>One hundred two patients with a diagnosis of RRMS were recruited through the Helen Durham Centre for Neuroinflammation at the University Hospital of Wales, and 27 healthy controls (HC) were recruited from the community. All participants were between 18 and 60 years of age, were right-handed, and had no contraindications for MR scanning. Patients had no comorbid neurologic or psychiatric disease, were relapse-free, and had no change to treatment for 3 months before the MRI scan. All participants underwent MRI scanning and assessment of clinical and cognitive function in 1 study session.</p>

        <title>MRI Acquisition</title>
        <p>All participants underwent MRI examination on a 3T MR scanner (General Electric HDx MRI System, GE Medical Devices, Milwaukee, WI) with an 8-channel receive-only head radiofrequency coil. A high-resolution 3-dimensional T1-weighted (3DT1) sequence was acquired for identification of T1-hypointense MS lesions, segmentation, registration, and volumetric measurements (resolution 1 × 1 × 1 mm, echo time [TE] 3.0 milliseconds, repetition time [TR] 7.8 milliseconds, matrix 256 × 256 × 172, field of view [FOV] 256 × 256 mm, flip angle 20°). A T2/proton density–weighted sequence (voxel size 0.94 × 0.94 × 4.5 mm, TE 9.0/80.6 milliseconds, TR 3,000 milliseconds, FOV 240 × 240 mm, 36 slices) and a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence (voxel size 0.86 × 0.86 × 4.5 mm, TE 122.3 milliseconds, TR 9,502 milliseconds, FOV 220 × 220 mm, 36 slices) were acquired for identification and segmentation of T2-hyperintense MS lesions. rs-fMRI was acquired with a T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence (voxel resolution 3.4 × 3.4 × 3 mm, TE 35 milliseconds, TR 3,000 milliseconds, FOV 220 × 220 mm, 100 volumes, 46 axial slices, each in an interleaved order), during which all participants were instructed to relax with their eyes closed. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) was acquired with a twice-refocused diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar sequence with 6 volumes with no diffusion weighting and 40 volumes with diffusion gradients applied in uniformly distributed directions (Camino 40) (b = 1,200 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, voxel size 1.8 × 1.8 × 2.4 mm, TE 94.5 milliseconds, TR 16,000 milliseconds, FOV 230 × 230 mm, 57 slices). CBF was quantified with multi-inversion time-pulsed arterial spin labeling (ASL). A PICORE QUIPSS II sequence with a dual-echo gradient-echo readout and spiral k-space acquisition was used (voxel size 3 × 3 × 8 mm, 22 slices).<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Sixteen tag-control pairs each for short inversion times (TIs) (400, 500, 600, 700 milliseconds) and 8 tag-control pairs for long TI (1,100, 1,400, 1,700, and 2,000 milliseconds) were acquired with QUIPSS II cutoff at 700 milliseconds. A calibration (M<sub>0</sub>) image was acquired to obtain the equilibrium magnetization of CSF, needed for the quantification of CBF. A minimal contrast image was acquired with TE of 11 milliseconds and TR of 2,000 milliseconds to correct for coil inhomogeneities.</p>

        <p>rs-fMRI blood oxygen level–dependent time series were corrected for physiologic noise in MATLAB<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (MathWorks, Natick, MA) with the use of a previously established pipeline.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> rs-fMRI images were preprocessed with the FSL MELODIC pipeline,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> which included motion correction, spatial smoothing with a 3-mm full width at half-maximum gaussian kernel, high-pass temporal filtering equivalent to 0.01 Hz, nonlinear registration to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space, and resampling to a resolution of 4 mm isotropic. Head motion parameter estimates of absolute and relative displacement values did not differ between any groups (HC-RRMS <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.58 [absolute], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.27 [relative]; CP-CI <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.11 [absolute], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.52 [relative]).</p>
        <p>Independent component analysis, part of the MELODIC pipeline, decomposed the concatenated dataset into 82 components.

          <p>Second, we determined whether there were more diffuse changes in anatomic connectivity and CBF throughout each RSN. A binary mask of each RSN was created and, for dMRI analyses, dilated by 1 voxel to include the WM surrounding RSN regions. Voxelwise analyses of ACM, FA, and CBF maps were conducted to look for abnormalities within the RSN regions. For FA, this was done both with skeletonized FA maps in a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and with nonskeletonized FA maps. TBSS overcomes the difficulties of achieving accurate registration of the WM by projecting all participants’ FA data onto a mean FA tract skeleton before applying voxelwise cross-participant statistics. However, the FA skeleton includes only the center of WM tracts<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and may not capture WM local to GM network regions; hence, we conducted both in an exploratory analysis to determine which is most sensitive to FA changes in and around RSNs. Next, we extracted median ACM, FA, and CBF values from the RSNs and compared them between CI and CP patients. The voxelwise analysis approach can show the spatial location of any abnormalities in the metrics studied but requires the abnormalities to be in the same spatial location in most individuals in a group for a group difference to be detected. If this is not the case, a group difference could be missed. Hence, we also extracted median values from our regions of interest in an exploratory analysis. Medians, rather than means, were extracted because ACM, FA, and CBF values were not normally distributed in RSN regions.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we provide the first evidence that abnormal FC co-occurs with altered structural connectivity and CBF in CI patients with MS in RSN regions. At the same time, our findings reveal that the exact location of abnormalities differed between metrics. Overall, this indicates that RSNs may be vulnerable to clinically relevant MS pathology, offering partial support for activity-related wear-and-tear damage of network hubs predicted by the nodal stress hypothesis.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>We found FC abnormalities in our RRMS cohort relative to HC in all RSNs investigated, confirming FC changes as a widespread pathologic feature in MS, as per previous studies.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> In CI compared to CP patients, we found FC abnormalities in all networks investigated, with FC decreases in the DMNa and DMNp and increases in the RFPN and LFPN making up the highest proportion of affected network voxels. Increased FC could reflect compensatory mechanisms after structural damage, and decreased FC could be evidence of network breakdown.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> However, we did not assess the extent of structural damage and can therefore only speculate about the mechanisms of directional FC change, which is an urgent research priority in this field. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with numerous previous reports of abnormal FC in these networks in patients with cognitive symptoms.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">-</xref><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> It is important to note that the FC measure distinguished the 2 patient groups in the absence of significant differences in conventional MR metrics, demonstrating its potential heightened sensitivity to clinically relevant pathology in MS and highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms of FC changes.</p>
      <p>As predicted, we found reduced anatomic connectivity of networks showing FC abnormalities in CI patients with both the ACM and FA metrics. ACM is an anatomic network measure that shows whether the structural connectivity of a region is affected as a result of WM damage, regardless of where in the brain the WM damage is. It is informative of the degree of connectivity of our regions of interests but not about the WM in and around RSN regions. To understand local tissue characteristics of RSN regions, we also tested the FA metric, a measure of the directionality of diffusion within tissue, which is assumed to be determined by the presence of aligned axons in WM bundles<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and can give information about local microstructural integrity in a WM tract. The specific voxels showing FC abnormalities were not those that showed structural changes in CI patients. Instead, other parts of the RSNs were affected. This, combined with widespread ACM and FA changes, suggests that more diffuse, as opposed to focal, anatomic changes within RSNs are associated with cognitive impairment and is in line with previous evidence showing that FC changes are preceded by a high degree of structural damage.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In addition to reductions, we found small regions of increased ACM and FA in all 4 RSNs. One possibility is that these are statistical artifacts. ACM increases could reflect an unmasking effect whereby tracking becomes easier in regions where fibers are lost. However, Bozzali et al.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> found ACM increases in patients with Alzheimer disease and considered that they may be due to plasticity driven by medication. The mechanism of FA increases is not well understood, but it has been suggested that increased FA reflects changes in axonal structures such as reduced branching, decreased axon diameter, reduced packing density, or increases in myelination.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> In MS, FA increases may be related to inflammatory processes.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> We cannot conclude which mechanisms are responsible for the ACM and FA increases in our CI group but acknowledge the findings as important areas for future research.</p>
      <p>Finally, we investigated CBF, which may be a response to decreased energy demand in MS.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> As with ACM and FA, CBF was reduced in and around RSN regions in CI relative to CP patients but not within the specific voxel clusters showing FC abnormalities, again pointing to diffuse rather than focal tissue abnormalities in RSNs. CBF reductions may reflect a response to decreased energy demand in the RSNs investigated, demonstrating altered metabolic function of RSN regions. However, there are suggestions that CBF changes could be due to a primary vascular insult,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and future studies with more direct measures of metabolism, such as fluorodeoxyglucose PET could help elucidate the metabolic status of functional networks.</p>
      <p>Overall, our findings show that diffuse ACM, FA, and CBF abnormalities co-occur with RSN FC changes in CI patients with MS, consistent with the nodal stress hypothesis. The mechanism of nodal wear and tear remains to be elucidated and may relate to unmet metabolic demands.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> There is preliminary evidence that functional networks are susceptible to metabolic changes, recently from a drosophila model in which network changes are coupled to neuronal metabolism.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Similarly, metabolic changes have been reported in demyelinated axons<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> and if this results in axonal damage or dysfunction that could be reflected in WM metrics in and around affected RSN regions. Thus, our results are not inconsistent with a role of metabolic changes in RSN regions. However, our methods are indirect measures of metabolic function. Other MR modalities such as fluorodeoxyglucose PET support the role of shared metabolic patterns between regions on RSNs,<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> and 23 Na MRI can show changes in sodium concentration in tissue, which is a measure of the energy state of axons.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> If combined with rs-fMRI, these methods may be informative about the metabolic basis of FC changes.</p>
      <p>There are limitations to consider when interpreting these results. First, our control group was younger and more educated than our patient cohort. We controlled for this by including age, sex, and education as covariates in our analyses. It is important to note that the CI and CP groups did not differ significantly on these demographic variables. We also did not investigate separate cognitive domains but looked at overall cognition. There have been suggestions that domains may be affected differently by pathology,<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> and this is an important avenue for future work. Furthermore, we conducted several exploratory analyses to understand how best to explore changes in WM metrics and CBF in and around functional network regions. Comparisons of extracted median ACM, FA, and CBF values from RSN regions showed no group differences between CI and CP patients, pointing to heterogeneity in the metrics across the regions. We conclude that the voxelwise analysis is more sensitive to group differences. The TBSS analysis and the voxelwise analysis of nonskeletonized FA maps showed FA reductions in largely the same regions. The latter additionally showed FA changes at the WM-GM boundaries, which could reflect FA abnormalities in the GM, as has been reported in MS in several studies (reviewed by Inglese and Bester<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>). However, findings of group differences at the edge of the brain and at the midline point to partial volume effects due to registration problems with nonskeletonized FA images and suggest that results need to be interpreted with caution. Related to this, we assessed metrics that are susceptible to partial volume effects. However, the same MR sequences were used for all participants, so any tissue contamination is unlikely to introduce bias in our group comparisons. Finally, we assessed whether FC, ACM, FA, and CBF changes co-occur, but we did not test whether these changes are correlated, which should be investigated in future studies with larger samples.</p>
      <p>Our study provides evidence that FC changes in CI patients with RRMS co-occur with abnormal blood flow and anatomic connectivity. This highlights the possibility of a common underlying pathologic change in RSNs such as altered metabolic state in CI patients. The metabolic state of functional networks affected by MS should be further investigated with more direct methods of metabolic brain function to determine the pathologic basis of FC abnormalities and potentially lead to their use as effective biomarkers of disease.</p>
