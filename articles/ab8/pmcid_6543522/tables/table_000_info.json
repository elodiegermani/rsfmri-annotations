For age, years post onset, severity, total treatment sessions and left IFG volume (in mm3), values shown are Mean (Standard Deviation). P-values are from Welch two sample t-tests for continuous outcomes and Fisher's exact test for categorical outcomes. R-squared (R sq.) is obtained from simple linear regression of the change in letter accuracy against each covariate. Language severity is based on the language subset from the FTD-CDR scale. Total severity refers to the sum of boxes, including language and behavior as added in Knopman et al., 2008. The two groups (tDCS vs. sham) were matched in all measures.", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_000.csv"}
