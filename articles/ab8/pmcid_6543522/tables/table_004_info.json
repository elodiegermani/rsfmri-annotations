Pairs are identified by asymptotic two-sided Wald tests on average treatment effect (ATE) at significance level 0.05 before adjusting for multiple comparisons. Estimates of ATE, standard error (SE), Wald statistics (Stat.), P-values, FWER corrected P-values (Adj. P.), 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Results are ranked by test statistics.", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_004.csv"}
