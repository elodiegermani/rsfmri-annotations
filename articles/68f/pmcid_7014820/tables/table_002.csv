Influence of GSR on:,Longitudinal analysis,Cross-sectional analysis (HCP dataset)
Within-network connectivity (small RSNs),-Network-level:→RMSD1: small (≤0.1Hz)→HA2: no difference in hemispheric dominance-Connection-level:→Most connections showed negligible effects of GSR→Minority of connections small effects of GSR,"-Network-level:→RMSD1: small (≤0.1Hz), except SMR (0.17Hz)→HA2: no difference in hemispheric dominance-Connection-level:→Some extrinsic connections showed decisive evidence for change in connectivity after GSR; however, most effect sizes were small (<0.1Hz)"
Between-network (BN) connectivity,-Network-level:→RMSD1: small (0.04Hz)→Negligible effect size concerning influence on BN3 connectivity (maximum difference 0.04Hz)→Substantial to strong evidence for a very small decrease (0.02Hz and 0.04Hz) in average influence of DMN5 on SAL6 and SMR4-Connection-level:→Small decreases in connectivity were found after GSR,"-Network-level:→RMSD1: small (0.09Hz)→Decisive evidence for influence of GSR on average BN3 connectivity, but effects were small (average 0.05Hz)-Connection-level:→Excitatory influences became inhibitory after GSR (from SMR4 and DMN5 on SAL6)→Additional inhibitory influences after GSR (from SAL6 and SMR4 on DMN5)→Inhibitory effect SMA (part of SMR) on all connections in SAL disappeared after GSR"
Global observation noise parameters,-No influence,"-Non-negligible influences, but not specific to observation noise parameters"
