Prediction: A regression model constructed using pre-ECT connectivity within regions with strong electric field strength during ECT [i.e., 10 connections within orbital prefrontal lobe, mediotemporal lobe (i.e., hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala) insula, and temporal lobe] generated a good prediction of ECT outcome.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>*Supplementary material where all the ROIs should be listed, was not available.AAL, automated anatomical labeling (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., ???); ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; AVH, SCZ individuals with treatment-resistant auditory verbal hallucinations; AVLT, Rey Auditory and Verbal Learning Test; BPRS, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; CLZ, clozapine; CPZ, chlorpromazine; DMN, default mode network; DSZ, SCZ individuals taking only antipsychotics; ECT, electroconvulsive therapy; HC, healthy controls; ICA, independent component analysis; MSZ, TRS individuals receiving a regular course of modified ECT combined with antipsychotics; NAVH, non-hallucinating SCZ individuals; NTRS, non-treatment-resistant SCZ; PANSS, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex, PFC, prefrontal cortex; post-CG, post-central gyrus; preCG, precentral gyrus; ReHo, regional homogeneity; ROI, region-of-interest; SMN, somatomotor network; TRS, treatment-resistant SCZ; UFM, unaffected family members; UTRS, ultra-treatment-resistant SCZ.</transformed-table></extracted-table></extracted-tables-set>
