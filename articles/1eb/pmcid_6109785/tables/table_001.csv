Unnamed: 0_level_1,FC,T2LL,MSSS,Unnamed: 4_level_1
Scenario 1,,,,FC reductions driven by MS lesions
Scenario 2,,,,True functional compensation
Scenario 3a,,,,Functional compensation attempt
Scenario 3b,,,,False functional compensation
Scenario 4a,,,,Neurodegeneration (reduced FC not due to MS lesions)
Scenario 4b,,,,Pre-symptomatic condition (damage precedes clinical manifestation of MS)
