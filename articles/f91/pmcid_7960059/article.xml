      <abstract>
        <p>It was reported that acupuncture could treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) with the potential mechanisms remaining unclear. The aim of the study is to explore the effect of the combination stimulus of Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) on the resting-state brain networks in AD, beyond the default network (DMN). Twenty-eight subjects including 14 AD patients and 14 healthy controls (HCs) matched by age, gender, and educational level were recruited in this study. After the baseline resting-state MRI scans, the manual acupuncture stimulation was performed for 3 minutes, and then, another 10 minutes of resting-state fMRI scans was acquired. In addition to the DMN, five other resting-state networks were identified by independent component analysis (ICA), including left frontal parietal network (lFPN), right frontal parietal network (rFPN), visual network (VN), sensorimotor network (SMN), and auditory network (AN). And the impaired connectivity in the lFPN, rFPN, SMN, and VN was found in AD patients compared with those in HCs. After acupuncture, significantly decreased connectivity in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) of rFPN (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007) was identified in AD patients. However, reduced connectivity in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.047) and left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.041) of lFPN and some regions of the SMN (the left inferior parietal lobula (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004), left postcentral gyrus (PoCG) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001), right PoCG (<italic>P</italic> = 0.032), and right MFG (<italic>P</italic> = 0.010)) and the right MOG of VN (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003) was indicated in HCs. In addition, after controlling for the effect of acupuncture on HCs, the functional connectivity of the right cerebellum crus I, left IFG, and left angular gyrus (AG) of lFPN showed to be decreased, while the left MFG of IFPN and the right lingual gyrus of VN increased in AD patients. These findings might have some reference values for the interpretation of the combination stimulus of Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) in AD patients, which could deepen our understanding of the potential mechanisms of acupuncture on AD.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and a progressive neurodegenerative disease, which is characterized by two mainly pathological changes including amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, finally resulting in neuronal degeneration and loss [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The disease affected millions of elderly subjects worldwide causing remarkable costs to the society. However, there is no effective method for early diagnosis and treatment of AD in the world [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Acupuncture, an alternative and complementary treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, to date, has been widely used to ameliorate impairments in neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD patients and rodent models [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the potential mechanisms of acupuncture on AD remain unclear.</p>
      <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain's response to intrinsic or environmental demands and reorganizing its structure and function, which is engaged in brain development, learning, and self-healing of neural injuries [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Neurogenesis, dendritic remodeling and synapse turnover, and modulation of the structure and function of neuronal networks were involved in this physiological process [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It was reported that neural plasticity dysfunction may contribute to brain network disruption in AD [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Abnormal functional connectivity was demonstrated to be a candidate biomarker for AD, and its severity correlates with clinical disease severity in AD [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Previous studies have revealed abnormal large-scale functional brain networks in AD patients, which include the default mode network (DMN) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the salience network (SN), frontal parietal network (FPN) [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], visual network (VN) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], sensorimotor network (SMN) [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and auditory network (AN) [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We previously found that enhanced functional connectivity (FC) in some regions of the DMN caused by the acupuncture stimulation of Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) might be associated with improvement of cognitive function in AD patients [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. According to traditional Chinese medicine, both Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) are known as hubs for internal and external energy gathering and transforming. And the combination stimulus of Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) is defined as “the four gates,” which is usually applied to promote the circulation of “Qi” and blood throughout the whole body [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Besides the DMN, the effect of acupuncture on other large-scale resting-state networks remains unknown in AD.</p>
      <p>Herein, we aim to explore the effect of combination stimulus of Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) on other resting-state networks including the salience network (SN), frontal parietal network (FPN), visual network (VN), sensorimotor network (SMN), and auditory network (AN) in the AD patients. Our finding could enrich the understanding of mechanisms of acupuncture on AD.</p>

        <title>2.1. Subjects</title>
        <p>This study was approved by Xuanwu Hospital Medical Ethics Committee of Capital Medical University. Fourteen patients diagnosed with AD were recruited from Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University and underwent professional and complete physical and neurological examinations, standard laboratory tests, and specific neuropsychological evaluations. The diagnosis of AD fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] for dementia and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] for clinically probable AD. Subjects with AD have a global score of clinical dementia rating scale (CDR) of 1 or 2 [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Fourteen healthy controls (HCs) with normal cognitive function matched by age, gender, and educational level were included as a healthy control (HC) group for neuroimaging comparisons.</p>
        <p>Individuals with psychosis, stroke, tumors, trauma, severe hypertension, epilepsy, substance abuse, mental retardation, or contraindications for MRI (cardiac defibrillators, pacemakers, electromagnetic system implants, mechanical heart valves or vascular clips, cochlear implants, or claustrophobia) were excluded. All participants provided their written informed consent before being involved in the study.</p>

        <title>2.2. Acupuncture Timeline</title>
        <p>Cloud &amp; Dragon brand (Cloud &amp; Dragon Medical Device Co., Ltd, Jiangsu, China) disposable acupuncture needles (size 0.30 × 25 mm) were used. After baseline MRI scans, all participants received manual acupuncture at bilateral Hegu (LI4, located in the hand dorsum) and Taichong (LR3, located in the dorsalis of the foot) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for all point locations). After skin disinfection, acupuncture needles were inserted 10 to 15 mm into the skin. Following needle insertion, manual stimulations such as small, equal manipulations of twirling, lifting, and thrusting were performed on all needles to induce characteristic sensation “de qi” (a composite of sensations including soreness, numbness, distention, heaviness, and other sensations), which is assigned as an essential component for acupuncture efficacy [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The process of acupuncture stimulation lasted for three minutes, and then, all needles were withdrawn.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.3">
        <title>2.3. MRI Acquisition</title>
        <p>The baseline resting-state MRI data were acquired before the process of acupuncture stimulation. Participants firstly had rest for three minutes and then received manual acupuncture stimulation for three minutes. After the needles were withdrawn, another 10 minutes of resting-state fMRI scans was acquired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>MRI data acquisition was performed on a 3.0 T MR scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Foam padding and headphones were used to control head motion and scanner noise. The data scan parameters of resting-state fMRI were as follows: repetition time (TR) = 2,000 ms, echo time (TE) = 40 ms, flip angle (FA) = 90°, matrix = 64 × 64, field of view (FOV) = 240 × 240 mm<sup>2</sup>, slice thickness = 3 mm, slice gap = 1 mm, voxel size = 3.75 × 3.75 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>, and bandwidth = 2232 Hz/pixel. Rapid collection gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence prepared by magnetization method was used to acquire sagittal T1-weighted MR images (TR/TE = 1, 900/2.2 ms; FA = 9°; matrix = 256 × 256; inversion time = 900 ms; slice thickness = 1 mm, no gap; 176 slices).</p>
        <p>All image data were analyzed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSFA) [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The first 10 volumes of each subject were removed, to make the signal to reach equilibrium and participants' adaptation to the scanning noise. The remaining volumes were corrected for within-scan acquisition time differences between slices, and the images with head movement greater than 2 mm in any direction or head rotation greater than 2° were excluded. To spatially normalize the fMRI data, the realigned volumes were spatially standardized into the MNI space using the EPI template. The functional images were resampled into a voxel size of 3 × 3 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>. Then, the functional images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 4 × 4 × 4 mm<sup>3</sup> full width at half maximum (FWHM) to reduce the spatial noise.</p>

        <title>2.4. Independent Component Analysis (ICA)</title>
        <p>The putative resting-state networks analysis was conducted by the group independent component analysis (ICA) of the GIFT software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://icatb.sourceforge.net">http://icatb.sourceforge.net</ext-link>, version 1.3i) [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and the minimum component length (MDL) criterion was used to determine the number of independent components (ICs) [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The fMRI data of all participants were concatenated into one group, the temporal dimension of the aggregate dataset was reduced through principal component analysis (PCA), and the separation of data was performed by the IC estimation of the informax algorithm (with time course and spatial maps) [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We further compared the stability of IC estimates of image data to account for spatial correlation at order estimated by minimum description length (MDL) criterion, based on the filtered and unfiltered data by using the software package ICASSO. ICs and time courses of each participant were back-reconstructed by GICA [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
        <p>We identified the brain network by visual inspection, which was previously described [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The individual-level components were extracted from back-reconstruction and were converted into <italic>z</italic>-scores, which reflect the degree of correlation between the time series of a given voxel and the mean time series of its components. For each network component, the <italic>z</italic>-score of each voxel was defined as the resting-state intranetwork FC.</p>

        <title>2.5. Statistics Analysis</title>
        <p>Continuous variables of demographics and neuropsychological scores were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and compared by Student's <italic>t</italic>-tests or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test based on distributional properties. Categorical variables were described as percentages and compared by chi-square tests. The statistical tests were two-sided, and a <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted with SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).</p>
        <p>The statistics analysis of images was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12</ext-link>). First, one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was used to achieve the brain network <italic>z</italic>-statistic map for each condition (HC_before, HC_after, AD_before, and AD_after). We use a family-wise error (FWE) correction with a threshold of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for multiple comparisons. Then, the statistics mask was made by combining the 4 conditions (i.e., HC_before, HC_after, AD_before, and AD_after), which were applied to compare the between-group differences (HC_before vs AD_before) and the interaction effect of acupuncture by group ([AD_before &gt; AD_after] &gt; [HC_before &gt; HC_after], [AD_after &gt; AD_before] &gt; [HC_after &gt; HC_before]). Second, two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was used to indicate the differences of the whole brain network (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, FWE correction) between-group difference in AD and HC groups before acupuncture (NC_before vs. AD_before) controlling for gender and age as covariates. Based on the group differences before acupuncture (HC_before vs. AD_before), regions of interest (ROIs) were defined according to the activated clusters. To determine the effect of acupuncture on modulating brain network connectivity, we extracted the <italic>z</italic> values for the regions with different connections. Then, a paired <italic>t</italic>-test was involved in comparing the effects of acupuncture on the HC and AD groups in each ROI. Finally, a general linear model (GLM) [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] of covariance was used to compare the interaction effect (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, FWE correction) of acupuncture (before vs. after) by group (AD vs. HC). In addition, we calculated the respective simple main effects (i.e., AD_before vs. AD_after and HC_before vs. HC_after).</p>

        <p>Before acupuncture, except the functional connectivity in the AN without significant difference, the connectivity of other identified networks including lFPN, rFPN, SMN, and VN showed to be decreased in AD patients, compared with those of HCs.

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>AD is a progressive and complicated neurodegenerative disease caused by neuronal degeneration and cell loss of the whole brain [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. And its symptoms included memory loss, disorientation, mood and behavior changes, confusion, unfounded suspicions, and eventually, difficulty speaking, swallowing, and walking. In our study, we found decreased FC in some identified large-scale networks including lFPN, rFPN, SMN, and VN in AD patients, which suggested that AD might be related to changes of FC in larger-scale functional networks responsible for these abnormal behaviors [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Interestingly, we did not find the significant effect of the combination stimulus of Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) on all of the identified networks in AD patients. After controlling for the effect of acupuncture on HCs, we found the decreased FC in some regions of the lFPN, while increased FC in some regions of IFPN and VN in AD patients, which might suggest the effect of acupuncture on some restricted regions of specific brain networks selectively in AD. These results revealed the effect of the acupuncture stimulation of Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) on some large-scale brain networks of AD patients beyond DMN and might suggest the potential mechanism of acupuncture's effect on AD.</p>
      <p>The FPN was reported to play an important role in the executive control function and language [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Many studies indicated that the functional disconnection and compensation in the FPN might coexist in AD [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Zhao et al. found that the superior parietal gyrus (SPG) regions and left paracentral lobule (PCL) of FPN presented increased FC, while the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and left inferior parietal (IPL.L) regions showed decreased FC in AD patients [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although our results showed FC reduced within the FPN in AD patients, we found both disrupted and excessive enhanced FC of different regions in lFPN after combination stimulus of Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3). It is possible that during acupuncture, the region was activated to preserve and compensate for losses in function attributable to the degenerative effects of the disease; conversely, the region was reduced to restrain the excessive enhance due to the disease. All these findings might have coincided with the theory of dynamic functional reorganization.</p>
      <p>Usually, visual cortices are activated not only by visual stimuli but also by visual mental imaginary and remembering [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Previous studies suggested that acupuncture at Taichong (LR3) could specifically perform the bidirectional regulation (excitation and inhibition) on vision-related brain areas [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which might be a mechanism for treating vision-related diseases. This observation confirmed reduced FC of VN in the healthy olds and further verified that acupuncture stimulus of Taichong (LR3) might specifically regulate the VN. Moreover, complex visual disturbances are observed in AD patients, including constructional and visuoperceptual disorientation, specifically difficulties in searching for objects (figure–ground discrimination), finding their way in familiar surroundings (environmental agnosia) [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Many studies found that the reduced FC of ventral/dorsal VN could play a crucial role in the visuospatial disorder of patients with AD pathology [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which may associate with amyloid-beta and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) aggregation as well as neurodegeneration and axonal damage in visual cortical regions in AD pathology [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We found that combination stimulus of Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) activated FC of some regions in the VN of AD patients, which suggested acupuncture at Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) might treat visual disturbances in AD.</p>
      <p>Many evidences suggested that stimulation at Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) induced distinct response patterns. For example, it was reported that acupuncture at Hegu (LI4) mainly specifically deactivated right frontal areas [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. And many researches showed that acupuncture at Taichong (LR3) mainly specifically activated the brain functional network that participates in visual function, associative function, and emotion cognition [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This observation identified decreased FC of the rPFN in AD patients and significantly reduced FC of the SMN, lFPN, and VN in the HCs after acupuncture at Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3). These results coincided with previous findings, which suggested that acupuncture at Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) may regulate the neuroplasticity of specific brain networks to induce therapeutic effects. But we only find acupuncture at Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) effect in the VN and lFPN in AD patients, after controlling for the effect of acupuncture on HCs. This might be partly explained by pathology and characteristics of AD; that is, the destruction of the SMN and rFPN due to AD might be so severe that acupuncture failed to preserve their integrality. Thus, FC in more regions were significantly changed in HC than AD. Moreover, a relatively small sample size might provide another explanation.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have found that acupuncture could modulate the synaptic plasticity in AD patients or animal model [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], by enhancing long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of the hippocampus [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], increasing the synapse number and postsynaptic density thickness [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and modulating regional spontaneous activity [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is well known that neuroplasticity might contribute to preserve the integrality of brain networks. In this study, the neurophysiology mechanism of this influence on the lFPN and VN of AD patients remains unclear, which remains to be established.</p>
      <p>There are still some limitations in our study. First, we did not demonstrate whether the enhancement or reduction was associated with acupoint specificity due to the lack of the sham acupuncture needle. Second, we did not find the correlation between changes of functional connectivity of these networks after acupuncture and behaviors in AD patients. Third, a relatively small sample size was included in this study. Furthermore, despite controlling the sequence of scan and using the ICA method, the influence of the scan lengths on the reliability and similarity of FC would be inescapable [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The changes in FC after a few minutes of stimulation may be merely a transient change in reactivity, which might not completely equal to the effect of acupuncture on neuroplasticity. Given that the sustained effect of acupuncture on the network is unclear, in the future, we will design a longitudinal study to trace these patients at different time points and explore the alteration of brain network in patients with AD after acupuncture for a period time. Therefore, future longitudinal studies with a much larger sample are warranted to elucidate the progressive functional changes caused by acupuncture in AD patients and its relationship with the clinical performances.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>In conclusion, by using the ICA method, our study found that the activity of large-scale brain networks in AD patients could be mediated by the acupuncture stimulation on Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3). These findings have important implications for the underlying neurobiology of AD and the effect of acupuncture on the disease, which might have some reference values for the interpretation of the therapeutic effects of acupuncture at Hegu (LI4) and Taichong (LR3) on AD in the future.</p>
