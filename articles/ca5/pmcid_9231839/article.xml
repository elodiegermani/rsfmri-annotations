          <title>Background and Objectives</title>
          <p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a risk factor for subsequent neurodegeneration. We aimed to identify brain metabolism and functional connectivity changes related to MCI in patients with iRBD and the neuroimaging markers' predictive value for phenoconversion.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>This is a prospective cohort study of patients with iRBD with a mean follow-up of 4.2 ± 2.6 years. At baseline, patients with iRBD and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)–PET and resting-state fMRI scans and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Voxel-wise group comparisons for FDG-PET data were performed using a general linear model. Seed-based connectivity maps were computed using brain regions showing significant hypometabolism associated with MCI in patients with iRBD and compared between groups. A Cox regression analysis was applied to investigate the association between brain metabolism and risk of phenoconversion.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Forty patients with iRBD, including 21 with MCI (iRBD-MCI) and 19 with normal cognition (iRBD-NC), and 24 HCs were included in the study. The iRBD-MCI group revealed relative hypometabolism in the inferior parietal lobule, lateral and medial occipital, and middle and inferior temporal cortex bilaterally compared with HC and the iRBD-NC group. In seed-based connectivity analyses, the iRBD-MCI group exhibited decreased functional connectivity of the left angular gyrus with the occipital cortex. Of 40 patients with iRBD, 12 patients converted to Parkinson disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Hypometabolism of the occipital pole (hazard ratio [95% CI] 6.652 [1.387–31.987]), medial occipital (4.450 [1.143–17.327]), and precuneus (3.635 [1.009–13.093]) was associated with higher phenoconversion rate to PD/DLB.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Discussion</title>
          <p>MCI in iRBD is related to functional and metabolic changes in broad brain areas, particularly the occipital and parietal areas. Moreover, hypometabolism in these brain regions was a predictor of phenoconversion to PD or DLB. Evaluation of cognitive function and neuroimaging characteristics could be useful for risk stratification in patients with iRBD.</p>

    <p>Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), a parasomnia manifested by vivid dreams associated with simple or complex motor behavior during REM sleep, has been recognized as a prodromal condition of Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLBs).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> A recent meta-analysis identified that the average phenoconversion rate in patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) to a defined neurodegenerative disease, such as PD, DLB, or multiple system atrophy (MSA), was 31.95% after a mean follow-up of 4.75 ± 2.43 years. The majority of patients with iRBD converted to PD (43%) or DLB (25%). The phenoconversion risk increased with time; the estimated risk was 96.6% after 14 years of follow-up.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Similarly, in a previous study of our cohort of patients with iRBD, we found a phenoconversion rate of 27.3% to PD, DLB, or MSA at a mean follow-up of 3 years, and the phenoconversion rate estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method was 35.5% at 5 years.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Studies on cognition in patients with iRBD identified impairments in multiple cognitive domains, such as attention, executive function, episodic memory, and visuospatial abilities,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and a high prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), from 32% to 50%.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Moreover, long-term follow-up studies found that &gt;90% of patients with RBD who later developed DLB had MCI at baseline.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In patients with PD, the coexistence of RBD, MCI, and orthostatic hypotension strongly predicted the future development of dementia.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Thus, understanding the underlying pathomechanisms of the cognitive impairment in patients with iRBD is important for predicting phenoconversion to PD or DLB.</p>
    <p>Several studies have explored brain changes in patients with iRBD associated with their cognitive impairment. Patients with iRBD with MCI had cortical thinning in the anterior and posterior temporal lobe, lateral occipital cortex, medial frontal cortex, and cingulate cortex and contraction in the putamen and thalamus compared with those without MCI.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In a previous study using brain perfusion SPECT, relative hypoperfusion in the medial occipital cortex and superior temporal gyrus and relative hyperperfusion in the hippocampus and putamen were found in the patients with iRBD with MCI.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Among various neuroimaging biomarkers, <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)–PET, as an indicator of synaptic dysfunction,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> has become an essential part of the diagnostic workup for neurodegenerative disorders. An abnormal brain network from FDG-PET imaging, known as PD-related metabolic pattern, could differentiate patients with PD from healthy controls and its expression was correlated with clinical disease severity.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In patients with DLB, occipital hypometabolism pattern with or without relative preservation of posterior cingulate metabolism to precuneus and cuneus (the cingulate island sign [CIS]) is a supportive biomarker for diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The CIS has been particularly effective in discriminating patients with DLB from those with Alzheimer disease (AD).<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Recently, we found that relative hypometabolism in the occipital area persisted during the follow-up period in patients with iRBD who later developed DLB.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Also, cognitive deterioration in patients with iRBD was correlated with expression of the metabolic pattern derived from patients with de novo PD with prolonged RBD symptoms before developing parkinsonism (dnPDRBD-RP),<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> characterized by relative hypometabolism in the occipital and precuneus cortex and relative hypermetabolism in the thalamus and putamen/globus pallidus.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> These results suggest that there are specific metabolic changes that reflect prodromal features of PD before motor symptoms appear in patients with iRBD. However, as a risk factor for the subsequent development of PD or DLB, little work has been done on the association between brain metabolic changes and MCI in patients with iRBD. A recent study found hypometabolism in the cuneus/precuneus in patients with iRBD with MCI compared with those without, but there were no longitudinal data to evaluate the predictive value of hypometabolism for phenoconversion.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
    <p>We aimed to identify brain metabolism changes related to MCI in patients with iRBD and to evaluate the predictive value of the metabolism for phenoconversion to PD or DLB. Moreover, using resting-state fMRI, we explored the disruption of intrinsic functional connectivity of the brain regions showing metabolic changes in patients with iRBD with MCI. This multimodal approach may help us better understand the neuropathologic mechanisms of MCI in patients with iRBD. We hypothesized that patients with iRBD with MCI would reveal relatively reduced brain metabolic and functional connectivity changes mainly in the posterior cortical region, as shown in patients with PD or DLB,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and this regional hypometabolism would associate with a risk of phenoconversion.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>Forty consecutive patients with iRBD who visited the neurology clinic at the Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center between 2013 and 2019 were prospectively enrolled in this study. Diagnosis of iRBD was based on the criteria of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, second edition (ICSD-II)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and confirmed by video-polysomnography. All patients underwent thorough neurologic evaluations for any signs of neurologic disease and were evaluated for parkinsonian symptoms using the Movement Disorder Society (MDS)–sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Exclusion criteria were psychiatric or neurologic comorbidity, moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea, and pathologic MRI findings other than mild white matter hyperintensities. We followed up the patients every 3–4 months to check for any changes in motor, nonmotor, or cognitive symptoms. Phenoconversion to PD, DLB, or MSA was diagnosed according to the MDS PD criteria,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Fourth Consensus Criteria of the DLB Consortium,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and Second Consensus Statement on MSA, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) (n = 24) who were free of any neurologic or psychiatric diseases were also enrolled during the study period.</p>
        <p>All participants underwent the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery at baseline.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> We evaluated cognitive performance as follows: (1) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); (2) attention and working memory: Trail-Making Test (TMT) A, digit span, and Color–Word Stroop Test (CWST); (3) executive function: TMT B and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)—semantic and phonemic; (4) memory: Seoul Verbal Learning Test (SVLT)—immediate recall, delayed recall, and recognition; (5) visuospatial function: Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT)—copy; (6) language: Korean version of the Boston Naming Test (K-BNT). The performance on each test was expressed as a <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> score based on the age- and education level–adjusted normative performance data. MCI diagnosis was based on the level I category of diagnostic criteria of PD-MCI according to the recommendations by the MDS Task Force.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Impairment on each neuropsychological test was determined by <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> score &lt;−1.5. We divided patients into 2 groups, patients with iRBD with MCI (iRBD-MCI) and those with normal cognition (iRBD-NC). Patients in the iRBD-MCI group can be classified as probable MCI with Lewy bodies (LB) according to the research criteria provided by McKeith and colleagues.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>

        <p>The association of brain glucose metabolism and cognitive function with phenoconversion in patients with iRBD was evaluated using a Cox regression analysis. For brain glucose metabolism, mean FDG uptake within the clusters showing significant hypometabolism in the iRBD-MCI group compared with the iRBD-NC group was extracted from each participant. The clusters were divided into anatomical structures using the Harvard-Oxford atlas. Patients with iRBD were subsequently dichotomized at 1 SD below the mean of HC for each significant structure and at 1 SD above the mean of HC for the CIS ratio. For cognitive function, the presence of MCI and scores of each neuropsychological test were included as a predictor in a separate analysis. In addition, we evaluated the effect of motor signs on a risk of phenoconversion using the presence of mild parkinsonian signs (MPS) or MDS-UPDRS-III scores as a predictor.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The current study investigated the brain metabolic and functional connectivity changes associated with MCI in patients with iRBD. The iRBD-MCI group revealed hypometabolism in the lateral and medial occipital, middle and inferior temporal cortex, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule compared with HC and the iRBD-NC group. Decreased metabolism was also found in the frontal pole in the iRBD-MCI group compared with the iRBD-NC group. When we evaluated the functional connectivity of the brain regions showing hypometabolism in the iRBD-MCI group, functional connectivities of the left inferior parietal lobule with the bilateral medial occipital and left lateral occipital cortex were decreased in the iRBD-MCI group compared with HC. During the follow-up, 11 out of 40 patients with iRBD developed PD or DLB. The baseline brain metabolism in the medial occipital cortex, occipital pole, and precuneus predicted phenoconversion to PD/DLB in patients with iRBD.</p>
      <p>Previous FDG-PET studies have consistently identified a specific RBD-related brain metabolic pattern (RBDRP), which was represented by relative metabolic decreases in the middle and lateral occipital, parietal, and temporal cortex and relative metabolic increases in the brainstem, cerebellum, sensory-motor cortex and hippocampus.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The relative posterior brain hypometabolism in our iRBD-MCI group considerably overlapped with the RBDRP, but we also found hypometabolism in the prefrontal area and no relative hypermetabolism in this group. On the other hand, the iRBD-NC group revealed no significant metabolic changes compared with HC. Consistent with our findings, a recent study evaluated metabolic differences among 3 groups—HC, patients with iRBD with normal cognition, and patients with iRBD with MCI—as in the present study, reporting that the iRBD with MCI group showed relative hypometabolism in the occipital, temporal, and parietal areas but patients with iRBD with normal cognition did not show any differences with the same statistical level when compared with HC.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The hypometabolism pattern in the iRBD-MCI group was distinct from regions of RBDRP and the iRBD-NC group did not reveal any different metabolism compared with HC. Therefore, we suggest that MCI in iRBD represents a different phenotype or a more progressed disease stage than iRBD-NC. Indeed, the iRBD-MCI group revealed higher MDS-UPDRS-III scores compared with the iRBD-NC group in the current study.</p>
      <p>The hypometabolism pattern in the iRBD-MCI group is similar to patterns of metabolic changes in patients with DLB<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> as well as patients at the prodromal stages of DLB,<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> which is characterized by medial and lateral occipital cortex hypometabolism with temporoparietal and frontal cortex hypometabolism. The DLB-related hypometabolism pattern can differentiate patients with DLB from those with AD, PD,<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> or other atypical parkinsonisms including corticobasal degeneration, MSA, and progressive supranuclear palsy.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> A study showed that patients with PD exhibiting the DLB-related hypometabolism pattern were associated with an increased risk of developing dementia during the subsequent disease course.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Moreover, patients with PD who had MCI before developing parkinsonism exhibited relative hypometabolism in the bilateral posterior temporo-parieto-occipital area. Among them, patients who later developed dementia exhibited hypometabolism in the posterior parieto-occipital association cortex more often than those who did not at an individual level.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> These results support our observations that the metabolic changes in the iRBD-MCI group mainly characterized by hypometabolism in posterior parietal and occipital regions are associated with phenoconversion to PD/DLB.</p>
      <p>We found that mean FDG uptake values in the medial occipital cortex, occipital pole, and precuneus are related to a high risk of phenoconversion to PD/DLB. Moreover, those brain regions already showed hypometabolism at baseline in patients who belonged to the iRBD-NC group, but later developed PD/DLB. Previous studies have consistently demonstrated that occipital hypometabolism is a robust marker for differential diagnosis between DLB and AD.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The hypometabolism in occipital areas also differentiated patients with MCI due to DLB from those due to AD, which suggest that the metabolic decrease could be present at a very early stage of disease.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Moreover, in a case study, patients with probable RBD who developed DLB revealed hypometabolism in the occipital lobe and parieto-temporal cortex at baseline.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> In patients with PD, incident dementia was heralded by posterior cortical hypometabolism, mainly in the occipital region.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Recently, our group reported that dnPDRBD-RP predicted cognitive decline in patients with iRBD.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The dnPDRBD-RP showed a relative metabolic decrease in the parietal and occipital cortex and precuneus, highlighting the importance of hypometabolism in posterior brain regions predicting disease progression in patients with iRBD. On the other hand, although MCI and MPS have been suggested as important predictive markers for phenoconversion to PD/DLB in patients with iRBD,<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> neither of them significantly associated with higher phenoconversion rate in the current study. Our relatively small sample size and short follow-up time might be associated with this inconsistency. Alternatively, many of our patients with iRBD have some degree of action tremors, which might attenuate the significance of MDS-UPDRS-III scores. We might need to apply objective motor testing to define MPS more clearly. These results suggest that the hypometabolism patterns on FDG-PET imaging might be more sensitive or earlier markers of phenoconversion than clinically defined MCI or MPS in patients with iRBD.</p>
      <p>Occipital hypometabolism is a distinctive pattern in patients with DLB compared with those with AD as mentioned above, while the metabolic reduction in the temporoparietal regions and precuneus represents a typical AD-related metabolic pattern.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Autopsy-confirmed AD and DLB cases showed hypometabolism in the temporoparietal and frontal association cortex in common, but only patients with DLB revealed occipital hypometabolism. Principal component analysis of regional glucose metabolism in patients with DLB revealed that the occipital hypometabolism was independent of the temporoparietal cortex or frontal cortex hypometabolism. Moreover, MMSE scores correlated with temporal, parietal, and frontal metabolic reduction, but not with occipital metabolic reduction.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Similarly, we found that patients with iRBD revealed positive correlations between cognitive performances and metabolism in the parietal and temporo-occipital cortex but not in the occipital regions. These results suggest that the occipital hypometabolism in the iRBD-MCI group may have distinct neural bases from hypometabolism in temporal and parietal regions. Neuropathologic explanation for the bases of hypometabolism may be speculative at this point, but several studies of patients with PD or DLB shed light on that matter. LB-related pathology in the occipital cortex was associated with a high risk of dementia in patients with PD or non-AD type dementia, such as DLB or corticobasal syndrome.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> On the other hand, a recent amyloid imaging study in patients with DLB, PD, or PD dementia identified increased amyloid deposition in temporal, parietal, and occipital areas compared with HC, and the occipital and parietal amyloid deposition was associated with striatal dopamine depletion and a shorter latency to dementia from onset of motor symptoms, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> These findings suggest that in terms of cognitive decline in patients with iRBD, the occipital hypometabolism could be more directly associated with LB-related pathology predicting future dementia, while the parieto-temporal hypometabolism might be associated with promoting disease progression. AD pathology frequently coexists with LB pathology in varying degrees, and associates with more aggressive disease course and more pronounced cognitive dysfunction in patients with PD/DLB.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Future pathologic or biomarker studies with longitudinal follow-up could elucidate the underlying mechanisms of brain metabolic alterations and the interaction between LB and AD pathologies on phenoconversion in patients with iRBD.</p>
      <p>Although the CIS is supposed to be highly specific for differentiating DLB from AD,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> we observed no differences in CIS ratios between the iRBD-MCI and iRBD-NC groups and no associations between the CIS ratios and phenoconversion to PD/DLB. Because RBD is acknowledged as a core clinical feature of DLB and occurs typically before the onset of dementia or parkinsonism,<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> some patients in the iRBD-NC group might have CIS despite the absence of MCI. In the present study, CIS ratios did not reveal a difference with HC. Therefore, it also could be possible that the CIS is not evident in the prodromal stage of DLB. Because we could not analyze parkinsonism first and dementia first phenoconverters separately in Cox regression analyses, the predictive value of CIS ratio might be underestimated in our sample. On the other hand, 1 patient in the iRBD-MCI group who was treated with ChEIs has maintained the diagnosis, which suggest that we cannot ignore the possibility that ChEI treatment might be associated with delaying phenoconversion in patients with iRBD. These results of the current study suggest that a future large prospective cohort study will be needed to clarify how the CIS and the use of ChEIs relate to phenoconversion in patients with iRBD.</p>
      <p>Using resting-state functional connectivity analysis, we found that MCI in patients with iRBD is related to disruption of the functional connectivity between the angular gyrus and occipital cortex, in addition to metabolic changes in these brain regions. This result is consistent with previous functional neuroimaging studies showing functional disruption of posterior brain regions related to cognitive dysfunction in patients with iRBD. In whole-brain functional connectivity analysis using network-based statistics, patients with iRBD revealed reduced cortico-cortical functional connectivity strength in posterior regions compared with HC, and this reduction was correlated with mental processing speed.<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> In seed-based approaches, functional connectivity of the left thalamus to the occipital cortex was increased in patients with iRBD compared with HC and the increased connectivity was associated with the word recognition score.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Moreover, in patients with PD, functional connectivity of brain posterior parts, prominently parietal and occipital cortex, was decreased compared with HC and the decrease in functional connectivity revealed correlation with cognitive decline.<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> We suggest that MCI in patients with iRBD is associated with both hypometabolism and functional disconnection of posterior brain regions and these changes may have a critical role in phenoconversion to PD/DLB.</p>
      <p>There are several limitations to the current study. Phenoconversion in patients with iRBD was not analyzed separately by dementia first or parkinsonism first conversion because of the limited number of converted participants in the study. Although PD and DLB are distinct entities, they share similar neuropathologic and clinical characteristics.<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> We suggest that the occipital and precuneus hypometabolism might be a shared biomarker of phenoconversion in patients with iRBD independent of motor or dementia first. We evaluated cognitive function and brain metabolism at 1 time point in the current study, but their longitudinal changes throughout the disease course might be more associated with later development of PD/DLB.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> To better understand the underlying pathophysiology of neurodegeneration in iRBD, we should investigate longitudinal changes of cognitive function and brain metabolism over time and explore the relationship between them. The diagnosis of PD/DLB was not confirmed at autopsy. However, we adopted standardized clinical diagnostic criteria, which showed high specificity in an autopsy validation study.<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> The presence of cognitive fluctuations was based on the patients’ and caregivers’ reports in this study. Although this might not affect our analyses significantly, the objective evaluation of cognitive fluctuation will be allowed to further stratification of phenoconversion risk in patients with iRBD.</p>
      <p>Cognitive impairment in patients with iRBD was related to functional and metabolic changes in posterior brain areas, particularly occipital and parietal areas. Moreover, hypometabolism in these brain regions was a predictor of phenoconversion. iRBD is a heterogeneous condition with a different phenoconversion diagnosis and a wide range of time to phenoconversion.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Evaluation of cognitive function and neuroimaging characteristics in patients with iRBD could be essential for monitoring phenoconversion and risk stratification for interventional trials in the future.</p>
