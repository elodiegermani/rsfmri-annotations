        <p id="P4">The salience network is responsive during a range of conditions requiring immediate behavioral responses, including pain processing. Resting-state functional connectivity of the salience network to the sensorimotor cortex is altered in chronic pain. However, little is understood about their fundamental communication in the absence of pain. In this study, we mapped salience network resting-state functional connectivity across sensorimotor cortex in healthy individuals. Using electromyography and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we first localized distinct regions-of-interest across sensorimotor cortex in medial (gluteal), intermediate (shoulder), and lateral (hand) areas. We then used resting-state fMRI for two cohorts (primary and replication) of healthy individuals from public repositories to map salience network resting-state functional connectivity across sensorimotor cortex. Both the primary and replication cohorts exhibited significant heterogeneity in salience network resting-state functional connectivity across the sensorimotor regions-of-interest. Using a cortical flatmap to visualize the entire sensorimotor surface, we observed similar heterogeneity in both cohorts. In general, the somatotopic representation of proximal body regions (trunk/face) had higher salience network resting-state functional connectivity compared to distal body regions (upper/lower limbs). We conclude that sensorimotor cortex is spatially heterogeneous in its interaction with the salience network in healthy individuals.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P5">Pain is a subjective experience driven by both bottom-up, and top-down mechanisms where nociceptive inputs are integrated with emotion, affect, mood, and other sensory feedback (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Bingel and Tracey, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Tracey and Mantyh, 2007</xref>). Integrating such sensory information with autonomic and emotional states is thought to occur within the salience network (SN), a widespread brain network often recognizable even in resting state (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>). The interaction between the SN and cortical areas of sensorimotor processing are highly relevant in chronic pain. Previous work in our group has identified changes in resting-state functional connectivity between the salience network (SN) and sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1) specific to the experience of chronic centralized pain (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Kutch et al., 2017</xref>). These connectivity changes are strongest in specific regions of S1/M1, suggesting resting-state functional connectivity between SN and S1/M1 is somatotopically-dependent. Recent work has validated the presence of somatotopic-specific alterations in SN-S1 resting-state functional connectivity, finding increased connectivity local to the low back region in patients with low back pain (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). A widespread network of activation is thought to govern central nervous system response to pain, including activation of SN and sensorimotor system regions (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Apkarian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Bingel and Tracey, 2008</xref>). Substantial evidence further supports somatotopically-dependent changes in brain activity and structure within S1/M1 associated with chronic pain (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Baliki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kairys et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Kutch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Makin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Such mounting evidence supports a top-down mechanism of chronic pain directly linked to the somatotopy of sensorimotor cortex (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Kutch et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the known role of SN and S1/M1 in chronic pain, there is little understanding of the fundamental communication between these regions in healthy individuals. Further, no study has explored the potential relevance of this communication in overall pain perception and development of chronic pain. By mapping the fundamental communication between the SN and S1/M1 in healthy individuals, we hope to explore how the interaction of these brain regions is not only critical for survival but may partially explain features of pain development such as why some body regions are more prone to chronic pain than others.</p>
      <p id="P6">The role of the SN is thought to broadly provide architecture to filter a stream of sensory stimuli into pertinent and non-pertinent information by redirecting an individual’s attention to particular stimuli (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Uddin, 2016</xref>). The SN is thought to integrate sensory, autonomic, and hedonic information to identify and respond to threats (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>). This general function has been inferred from the activation of key SN nodes including anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex during a wide range of tasks such as empathetic and physical pain, limbic function, error detection, and threat perception (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bastin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Etkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Singer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Wager et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Wiech et al., 2010</xref>). The integration of sensory information with affective or emotional states within the insula are thought to provide a homeostatic representation of salient stimuli (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Craig, 2011</xref>). Somatotopic-dependence in S1/M1, secondary sensory cortex and insular cortex suggest the representation of the body plays a key role in high level processing of salient stimuli both in SN and in its interactions with other cortical areas (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Baumgärtner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Ogino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Ruben et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P7">In this study, we explore the underlying interaction between SN and S1/M1 to establish if the relationship between SN and S1/M1 varies across body regions. Given previous findings that the perception of pain is non-uniform across the body (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Defrin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 1974</xref>), we hypothesized that healthy individuals exhibit SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity that is spatially heterogeneous across S1/M1 showing similar heterogeneity in primary motor and primary sensory cortices. This study will provide a foundation to better interpret altered SN-S1/M1 functional connectivity in patients with chronic pain in future studies.</p>

        <title>Summary of study procedures and analyses</title>
        <p id="P8">Task-based fMRI procedures were used to capture primary sensory (S1) and motor (M1) regions-of-interest (ROI) during the activation of three different muscle groups that were verified to be motorically distinct with electromyographic (EMG) data. SN resting-state functional connectivity within S1/M1 was evaluated in healthy individuals from a publicly available data repository. To understand group trends in SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity, we used the task-defined ROIs as anchor points of motorically distinct regions of S1/M1 for comparison between body areas. Finally, we evaluated trends in SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity across the entire S1/M1 cortical surface using a flattened map. SN resting-state functional connectivity results were validated in a second independent cohort of healthy individuals.</p>

          <title>Participants</title>
          <p id="P9">A cohort of 20 right hand dominant adults (age: 28 ± 3.4 years, 9 males) participated in a task-based fMRI study. Data collection was completed at the University of Southern California (USC), and all procedures were approved by USC Institutional Review Board. All participants provided their consent to participate. Individuals were excluded if they had contraindications to MRI or had reported history of neurological conditions or chronic pain.</p>

          <title>Task-based acquisition</title>
          <p id="P10">All participants were trained to perform isometric muscle contractions during three movement tasks. Movement tasks were performed supine including: (1) right index finger abduction; (2) right shoulder flexion; (3) bilateral gluteal contraction. During pilot testing, unilateral contractions of the gluteal muscles were difficult for some participants to perform, with substantially higher asymmetric body rotations and head motion in the scanner compared to bilateral contractions. Further, previous work from our laboratory suggests bilateral contractions are associated with bilateral activation in the motor cortex (<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Yani et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, bilateral gluteal contractions were used to localize the hip ROI. Primary movers for each movement task were identified and muscle activity was collected using electromyography (EMG) during the movement tasks from each primary mover. The muscles identified as primary movers were the first dorsal interosseous for index finger abduction, anterior deltoid for shoulder flexion, and gluteus maximus for gluteal contraction. EMG signals were collected, amplified, and filtered as previously described (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Asavasopon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Rana et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Yani et al., 2018</xref>). Maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) were performed for each task. Participants practiced producing a range of contraction intensities as the contraction tasks were replicated in the MRI scanner during task-based scans without EMG. Participants performed repeated 2-s contractions during each movement task to achieve consistent activation at a “low” (L), “medium” (M), and “high” (H) intensity of each primary mover: 15% for L, 30% for M and 45% MVIC for H for the gluteus maximus and first dorsal interosseous muscles, and 30% for L, 45% for M and 60% MVIC for H for the anterior deltoid muscle.</p>
          <p id="P11">A series of structural and functional MRI scans were then performed using a 3 Tesla scanner (GE Signa Excite) with an eight-channel head coil. Consistent with previously described methods (<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Yani et al., 2018</xref>), we acquired a T1-weighted high-resolution anatomical image from each participant, for the purpose of spatially registering functional images. Next, we collected T2-weighted echo planar image volumes with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast (echo time, 34.5 ms; flip angle, 90°; field of view, 220 mm; pixel size, 3.43 mm) continually every 2.5 s during three movement task imaging runs. Each volume consisted of 37 axial slices (3 mm slice thickness, 0.5 mm interslice gaps) that covered the brain from vertex to cerebellum. Each functional scan was 8 minutes in length consisting of 6 active blocks and 6 rest blocks. During each active block, participants were prompted to perform repetitive sub-maximal contraction at the L, M, and H contraction intensities as described above (block pattern: L-M-H-L-M-H) following visual timing cues within the scanner.</p>

          <title>Task-based analysis</title>
          <p id="P12">All EMG signals were collected during each movement task in a mock MRI scanner with consistent procedures as conducted during the MRI scans. EMG signals were high-pass filtered at 30 Hz (4th order zero-lag Butterworth filter), rectified, and low-pass filtered at 100 Hz (4th order zero-lag Butterworth filter). MVIC trials were processed using the same procedures above, and peak activity was used to normalize each EMG signal during the sub-maximal contraction trials. Finally, each EMG signal was smoothed using a 500 ms moving average window. Task independence was evaluated by comparing EMG activity from the primary mover during the designed movement task against the EMG signals of the reference muscle groups. Peak detection was used to quantify the maximum EMG activity for each muscle contraction. The ratio of peak EMG activity for each reference muscle relative to activity in the primary mover was reported as an average across all participants. EMG activity ratios were determined for each contraction level, each muscle, and across movement tasks. Low ratios of EMG activity between the reference and primary mover muscles would indicate isolation of the primary mover to the designed task.</p>
          <p id="P13">All fMRI data were preprocessed using FMRIB Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT). Standard processing steps including brain extraction using Brain Extraction Tool (BET) in FMRIB Software Library (FSL), slice timing correction, motion correction using a 12 degree of freedom model, and spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel with full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of 5 mm and nonlinear high-pass temporal filtering (150 s) within FSL were performed for each functional image. Brain regions significantly more active during the muscle contraction blocks of each task (index finger abduction, shoulder flexion, and gluteal contraction) were identified by first comparing the BOLD signal during active and rest blocks using a general linear model (GLM), followed by a group-level mixed-effect (FLAME 1 in FSL) analysis to identify voxels in standard MNI coordinates with significant increases in BOLD signal associated with muscle contraction compared to rest across the cohort of participants (all results were cluster corrected for multiple comparisons with <italic>Z</italic> &gt; 2.3 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The identification of motorically distinct cortical ROIs derived from a task based fMRI approach was previously validated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Asavasopon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Rana et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Yani et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
          <p id="P14">Voxels exhibiting significantly increased activity during muscle contraction were quantified as a z-score based on BOLD signal agreement to the underlying GLM across all study participants. The thresholded z-score images were used to define ROIs representative of each body site (index finger, shoulder, and hip). The tasks were designed to elicit simultaneous voluntary motor and proprioceptive events for each body site, and were therefore used to define both M1 and S1 ROIs. Precentral and postcentral gyri were used as the anatomical landmarks to define the boundaries of the primary motor cortex and primary sensory cortex, respectively (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Banker and Tadi, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">DiGuiseppi and Tadi, 2019</xref>). Voxels significantly activated by the task were separated into voxels within M1 and S1 if the voxel had at least 25% probability of belonging to the precentral gyrus or postcentral gyrus, respectively, defined by the Harvard-Oxford atlas (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Makris et al., 2006</xref>). For unilateral movement tasks (index finger abduction and shoulder flexion) significant voxels in ipsilateral hemisphere were not considered. The center of each active area was quantified using the three dimensional center of mass of each activity cluster. This resulted in 6 ROIs, one region in M1 and S1 for each movement task. Volumetric ROIs were then built as spherical regions with a radius of 6 mm placed on the active cluster center for each task.</p>
          <p id="P15">The influence of inter-individual variability in the development of task-defined ROIs were explored by calculating participant specific task-defined ROI centers. Participant specific activity clusters were derived from statistical maps of each voluntary contraction task. First level statistical maps representing the strength of agreement between the BOLD signal and the event related hemodynamic response function were thresholded using a cluster corrected approach for multiple comparisons (<italic>Z</italic> &gt; 2.3 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Primary motor and primary sensory activity cluster centers were defined as the center of gravity for clusters in precentral and postcentral gyrus, respectively.</p>

          <title>Participants and data</title>
          <p id="P16">Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) images from two publicly available repositories of healthy individuals were included for analysis: the 1000 Functional Connectome Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nitrc.org/ir">http://www.nitrc.org/ir</ext-link>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Biswal et al., 2010</xref>) and the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.niddkrepository.org/">https://www.niddkrepository.org</ext-link>, <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Alger et al., 2016</xref>). To generate the <italic>primary cohort</italic>, participants were included from the 1000 Functional Connectome Project. Data from a total of 1288 participants from 33 unique data collection sites were examined. An initial data search constrained the participant dataset to rs-fMRI acquisition parameters consistent with MAPP (3 Tesla scanner with repetition time (TR) = 2 s) resulting in 634 possible participants. From those, 489 participants with known age and sex were selected and preprocessing was performed (see below). The dataset was then further constrained to meet strict head-motion criteria; peak framewise displacement less than 0.3 mm (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Drysdale et al., 2017</xref>), resulting in 217 possible participants. Finally the cohort’s mean age and sex proportion was matched to the task-based fMRI group by iteratively removing participants with the maximum deviation from the desired mean age, resulting in a total of 154 participants (age: 27 ± 11 years, 69 Males, 9 sites) in the final primary cohort. This large healthy control repository afforded us the advantage to carefully control for head motion confounds. However, given our previous findings of altered SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity in chronic pain, we were concerned that heterogeneity we may observe in the primary cohort could be driven by a participant’s unassessed pain history within these otherwise healthy individuals. To address this concern, we generated a <italic>replication cohort</italic> of healthy participants who were verifiably pain free from the MAPP study. The MAPP dataset contained 124 healthy controls, each assessed for pain in the last 2 weeks on a 45-location body map of pain (Brief Pain Inventory) (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Kutch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Kutch et al., 2015</xref>). Eighty-two participants were identified after excluding those who reported pain at any body location. Finally, samples were removed if peak framewise displacement during the rs-fMRI scan exceeded 2 mm, previously recommended as an adequate threshold for rs-fMRI data (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Poldrack et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the potential of additional noise compared to the conservative threshold for head motion identified above, this threshold was chosen to maximize the participant pool of pain-free controls for analysis. These selection criteria resulted in a sample size of 66 pain free healthy controls (age: 36.0 ± 11.3, 42 males, 5 sites).</p>

          <title>Resting-state fMRI analysis</title>
          <p id="P17">rs-fMRI preprocessing was performed using FSL FEAT where functional images were first skull extracted using brain extraction tool (BET), motion corrected, and spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of full-width half-maximum of 5 mm and nonlinear high-pass temporal filtering (150 s). The first four volumes were removed to allow for signal stabilization. All fMRI images were then transformed into 3mm MNI standard coordinates to enable voxel by voxel comparisons across participants. A data-driven analysis of resting-state functional connectivity was completed using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Group average analysis was completed within the study population by concatenating volume-by-volume all rs-fMRI images and performing ICA on the concatenated images using FSL’s MELODIC tool (<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Woolrich et al., 2009</xref>). The analysis was constrained to 20 components to limit identification of sub-components (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Kutch et al., 2017</xref>). The set of spatial maps from the group analysis was used to generate subject-specific versions of the spatial maps, and associated timeseries, using dual regression with variance normalization (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Beckmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Filippini et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

          <p id="P18">The SN was identified from the 20 independent component spatial maps by computing the best fit between each independent component map and a template of the SN previously published (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Laird et al., 2011</xref>). The SN was identified separately for both the primary and replication cohort. SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity measure was reported as a normalized z-score, quantified as the strength of SN signal divided by the unassigned error in each voxel’s BOLD signal. SN resting-state functional connectivity across S1/M1 was mapped using an ROI analysis for both the primary and replication cohort as follows. SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity for each participant was quantified from dual regression generated spatial maps. SN-S1/M1 connectivity was averaged across all voxels within the each of the six spherical ROIs (index finger, shoulder, and hip), and separately compared in M1 and S1 ROIs (3 in M1, 3 in S1) using a linear mixed effect model. A single mixed effect model was used to statistically contrast SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity for the 3 primary motor ROIs, where body site (factor levels: index finger, shoulder, hip), participant age, sex (factor levels: male, female) and imaging site (factor levels: site 1, site 2, …, 9) were fixed effects, and a random intercept was included for each participant. All categorical variables were modeled using dummy variable reference coding. A congruous mixed-effect model was used to statistically contrast SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity for the 3 primary sensory ROIs with the same design described above. Confounds including scanner site, age and sex have all been previously shown to affect functional connectivity findings (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Damoiseaux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Ingalhalikar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Kilpatrick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Noble et al., 2017</xref>), and were therefore controlled in this study as confounds of no interest within the linear mixed effects model. Pairwise differences between ROIs were statistically tested using the linear model coefficient t-test, corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni corrections (<italic>α</italic> = 0.05).</p>
          <p id="P19">SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity was mapped from the fiducial cortical surface (surface half way between pial and white matter boundary) using the group average SN spatial map to visualize results on a flattened map of the entire cortex. The fiducial cortical surface was flattened by inflating and cutting the cortical surface at 5 locations along the medial hemisphere surface, taking special care not to cut portions of the precentral or postcentral gyrus. Cuts were used to limit distortion of the cortical surface during flattening (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). M1 and S1 boundaries were manually traced on the cortical surface using the Harvard–Oxford atlas with 25% or greater probability map for region identification. Finally, SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity was expressed on the cortical flatmap as a function of distance to the major hubs within SN, the anterior insula and anterior cingulate. Peak activity within the left anterior insula and left anterior cingulate were assessed as the maximum z-score within the SN map in the anterior insula and anterior cingulate in the left hemisphere. SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity was then assessed as a function of geodesic distance to each SN hub.</p>

        <title>Head motion in fMRI scans</title>
        <p id="P20">All fMRI scans included in this study were well controlled to limit head motion artifacts. Framewise displacement in task-based scans was low with 99% of all image frames having less than 2 mm of displacement, with average peak framewise displacement of 1.3 mm during the shoulder flexion task, 0.6 mm during the index finger task, 1.1 mm during the gluteal contraction task (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>). Resting-state images were also quality controlled to limit motion artifacts and maximize statistical power for both cohorts. Head motion was strictly controlled within the primary cohort with maximum framewise displacement equal to 0.3 mm. Head motion was also closely evaluated in the replication cohort where the maximum framewise displacement was limited to 2 mm, and 92% of all image frames had less than 0.3 mm displacement. We chose to use a stringent motion threshold in the primary cohort to ensure the findings were not influenced by head motion artifacts. Within the 1000 Functional Connectome repository, there were abundant high quality resting-state scans allowing us to use an especially stringent motion threshold without the inclusion of censoring or other motion artifact reduction techniques, which each present a unique challenge and potential pitfalls in resting-state analysis (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds, 2017</xref>). While this motion threshold was a good starting point, the threshold was unfeasibly stringent for data collected in a single study, as was the case for the replication cohort. Therefore a second, less stringent, motion threshold was adopted to maximize the available participant set within the replication cohort. Further description of overall head motion characteristics of this study are reported in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>.</p>

        <p id="P21">EMG data recorded during the three movement tasks showed largely independent muscle contraction patterns for the primary movers of each task (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 (A)</xref>). During the index finger abduction task, non-primary mover EMG activity was less than 1.3% of primary muscle activity. During the shoulder flexion task, non-primary mover EMG activity was less than 15% of primary muscle activity, likely higher due to the increased need for core stabilization, but still a relatively low percentage. During the gluteal contraction task, non-primary mover EMG activity was less than 3.4% of primary muscle activity.</p>
        <p id="P22">Clusters of significant brain activity were present in both precentral and postcentral gyri for all three movement tasks (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 (B)</xref>). The center of significant brain activity during the movement task was identified in lateral S1/M1 for the index finger, in mid S1/M1 for the shoulder and in medial S1/M1 for the hip (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 (C)</xref>). Group derived task-based ROIs (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) well represented the mean response across all study participants. Similarly, while inter-individual variability was evident in participant-level activity cluster centers, clear delineations are present between activity centers for the index finger task, compared to the shoulder task, and compared to the gluteal task (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The group derived task-based ROIs were used as anchor points to explore SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity.</p>

        <p id="P24">Significant heterogeneity of SN resting-state functional connectivity across S1/M1 in both the primary and replication cohorts were observed both in M1 and S1 ROIs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 (B)</xref> and (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>)). Within M1, in the primary cohort, SN resting-state functional connectivity to the hip ROI was significantly lower than the shoulder ROI (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0009); similarly in the replication cohort, SN resting-state functional connectivity to the hip ROI was significantly lower than the shoulder ROI (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Within S1, in the primary cohort, SN functional connectivity the index finger ROI was significantly lower than both the shoulder and hip ROIs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 respectively); similarly in the replication cohort, the index finger ROI was significantly lower than both shoulder and hip ROIs (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003; <italic>p</italic> = 0.002 respectively). Inter-individual differences of motor and sensory circuit locations may explain some variability observed in SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity captured in the ROI analysis. We further explored the potential heterogeneities in SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity with a ROI free approach using a flatmap to explore changes in connectivity across the entire sensorimotor cortex.</p>

        <title>SN functional connectivity across S1/M1 surface</title>
        <p id="P25">The spatial map of SN resting-state functional connectivity across the entire flattened cortical surface of S1/M1 showed relative peaks and minima in SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity consistent with the ROI analysis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Relative differences in SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity were preserved from a map of the fiducial surface (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 (A)</xref>), on an inflated surface (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 (B)</xref>) and flattened surface (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 (C)</xref>) of the cortex. It became clear inspecting flattened maps that the heterogeneity in SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity observed in the ROI analysis was part of a broader pattern of heterogeneity across S1/M1. In the primary cohort, local peaks and minima identified in the ROI analysis were seen on the full cortical map, but additional unidentified local peaks were present in lateral areas and ventromedial areas of both S1 and M1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 (D)</xref>). Similar local minima and maxima were observed in SN resting-state functional connectivity across the cortical surface of M1 and S1 within the replication cohort (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 (E)</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P26">To explore the dependence of the SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity on distance from key SN brain regions, we further explored the results on the flattened map. Peak SN resting-state functional connectivity in the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex were found at (−40,10, −1) mm and (−1,6,38) mm expressed in MNI (<italic>x,y,z</italic>) standard space. The distance between the SN hubs and M1/S1 did not solely explain heterogeneity of the SN-M1/S1 resting-state functional connectivity (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P27">Sensorimotor and salience networks are known to function as distinct resting-state networks (<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Uddin et al., 2019</xref>). These large-scale networks are defined based both on co-activation of these brain regions during a range of relevant tasks, and the temporal correspondence of the same regions even at rest (for summary <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Uddin et al., 2019</xref>). While the sensorimotor and salience networks are understood to interact (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Nomi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Uddin, 2015</xref>), the novelty of this study highlights the somatotopic dependence of their interaction even in healthy pain-free individuals. Specifically, we identified stronger SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity within the somatotopic representation of proximal body regions (trunk/face), compared to distal body regions (upper/lower limbs). Identification of non-homogenous SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity is especially meaningful as this resting-state feature has been associated with the signature of persistent pain conditions (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Kutch et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P28">Survival is contingent on the ability to rapidly assess incoming sensory information, to classify that information as relevant or irrelevant, and to initiate appropriate motor responses to mitigate threats. The SN is thought to fulfill the role of filtering the stream of sensory information and influencing the motor system (<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Uddin, 2015</xref>) through intercommunication among distributed brain regions including the anterior insula, anterior cingulate, thalamus, and amygdala (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Uddin, 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P29">The role of the SN describes a top-down mechanism used to modulate sensory experiences such as pain sensitivity and threat awareness. In this study, we interpret stronger SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity as a state of increased reliance of ‘threat assessment’ for specific body regions. General observations of human behavior support the theory that a “threat detection” system would prioritize core body regions, and are consistent with the general heterogeneous pattern of SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity strength that we observed across trunk, neck, and head somatotopy in S1/M1. Specifically, sensitivity to noxious stimuli is known to be higher in certain body areas compared to others, with generally lower sensitivity in the limbs (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Defrin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 1974</xref>). Furthermore, during protective motor behavior, limbs are often rapidly mobilized to protect trunk, neck, and head regions from impacts (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Carlsöö and Johansson, 1962</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Feldman and Robinovitch, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Hsiao and Robinovitch, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 1993</xref>). Interpretation of negative connectivity patterns identified between SN and S1/M1 in the limb somatotopic regions, while less prevalent in the literature, may reflect an inhibitory interaction between brain regions (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Gee et al., 2013</xref>), or a time delayed excitatory interaction (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). While it’s unclear the underlying mechanism of negative connectivity, a mutual inhibitory interaction could suggest a possible avenue to modulate salience network activity in individuals with chronic pain using stimulation points in sensorimotor cortex, a previously reported successful stimulation site (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Quintero, 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P30">We must also acknowledge alternative hypotheses to explain the heterogeneities in SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity. Alternative hypothesis 1: the overall SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity strength may have been driven by the size of a body site’s representative area in sensorimotor cortex. Body regions prioritized for fine motor control and touch perception (e.g. face, hand) have large representative areas (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</xref>); however, evidence suggests anatomical connections between sensorimotor cortex and other brain regions, while somatotopically distinct are not scaled based on body region (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Huffman and Krubitzer, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Krubitzer and Kaas, 1990</xref>). Further, contradictory SN resting-state functional connectivity patterns in the hand and face regions suggest the size of the representational area alone does not dictate the SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity strength. Alternative hypothesis 2: heterogeneities in SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity across sensorimotor cortex may have been driven by the proximity of sensorimotor regions to hubs within SN such as the anterior insula or anterior cingulate cortex. Functional connectivity can depend on spatial distance, with stronger short-range connections compared to long-range connections (e.g. <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Salvador et al., 2005</xref>) making this phenomenon important to quantify within this study. An analysis of SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity as a function of distance from both the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex showed while there are local peaks in connectivity within S1/M1 near the two critical hubs of SN, the heterogeneities of interest between the shoulder, finger, and gluteal ROIs are not explained by geometric distance to SN hubs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). To confirm our interpretation of SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity as a behavioral feature, future work must establish a link between threat-based sensory sensitivity or motor responsiveness to SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity, but our results clearly suggest future studies in this direction.</p>
      <p id="P31">Extensive evidence suggests the sensorimotor system, in a somatotopically distinct way, is integrally tied to the representation of centralized pain. Changes in SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity have been shown in a number of chronic pain conditions including chronic pelvic pain, fibromyalgia, and chronic low-back pain (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Kutch et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the retention of motor cortical representation and its connectivity to widespread brain networks in the hand motor area of M1 has been linked with higher perception of phantom limb pain in individuals with an upper limb amputation (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Makin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Makin et al., 2013</xref>). Modulation of pain perception through emotional, affective, and attentional changes has previously provided clear evidence of the involvement of cortical structures in altering an individual’s perceived pain (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bantick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Tracey and Mantyh, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Wiech et al., 2010</xref>). However, there is comparatively little evidence exploring how somatotopic-dependent interactions between key pain processing regions such as S1/M1, S2 and insula may also result in altered pain perception through a top-down driven approach (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Baumgärtner et al., 2010</xref>). From an epidemiological perspective, chronic pain is not uniformly distributed across the body surface, but instead tends to cluster in particular regions including the low back, head, neck, abdomen, and genitals (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Maixner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Statistics, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Von Korff et al., 1988</xref>). We hope to explore in future studies if specific subdivisions within the salience network play unique or driving roles in heightened functional connectivity to S1/M1 increasing our understanding of key brain regions involved in body representation and its relevance to centralized pain.</p>
      <p id="P32">We propose that heterogeneity in SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity found in this study may partially explain susceptibility of different body regions to chronic pain development through two mechanisms. First, body regions with intrinsically greater SN-S1/M1 functional connectivity may react more intensely when exposed to injury, resulting in a longer-lasting state of increased threat assessment and vigilance. For example, chronic pain may emerge from whiplash injury in a motor vehicle accident (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">McLean et al., 2005</xref>). Second, top-down systemic stressors that increase engagement of the salience system might be expected to preferentially activate areas of S1/M1 with pre-existing greater functional connectivity. For example, the role of stress has been described in chronic pelvic pain conditions that are not associated with co-morbid pain in the extremities, including the hands (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Harte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Kutch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Naliboff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Nickel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Rothrock et al., 2001</xref>). Further research is needed to test whether SN-S1/M1 resting-state functional connectivity can predict chronic pain development in specific body regions.</p>
      <p id="P33">While this study focused on the somatotopic organization of SN resting-state functional connectivity as a feature important to map, dysregulation of other widespread brain networks such as default mode network have also been implicated in chronic pain. Altered default mode network activity has been found in patients with chronic pain, in association the presence of pain catastrophizing, the perception of pain severity, and aberrant signaling of pain perception when no peripheral threat is evident (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Loggia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Makin et al., 2015</xref>), as well as in co-morbid mental health condition such as anxiety and depression (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Coutinho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Whitfield-Gabrieli and Ford, 2012</xref>). Future studies evaluating widespread network interaction should consider how interaction with somatotopically meaningful regions in S1/M1 may provide critical insight into the role of the body in central processing networks. Sensorimotor/salience links in pain may be only one example of much broader class of neural processes that use the somatosensory cortex and SN regions to monitor, predict, and control body state.</p>

        <p id="P39">Muscle activity and brain activity measured during controlled isometric motor tasks. A block paradigm of rest-active-rest task with 6 active blocks were performed, and muscle activity was evoked in a pulse active fashion. Participants were asked to perform an active isometric contraction every 4 s during the active period. Panel (A) shows electromyographic activity during one active block where 4 s pulse active isometric contractions are evident. Three motor tasks were performed including index finger abduction (row 1), shoulder flexion (row 2), and gluteal contraction where participants were instructed to “squeeze” their gluteal muscles (row 3). Electromyography was collected from three instrumented muscles active during the motor tasks including first dorsal interosseous active during finger abduction, anterior deltoid active during shoulder flexion, and gluteus maximus active during gluteal contraction. Average muscle activity across all participants (black) and standard error (gray) is shown for a contraction level of 30% maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) for each motor task. Panel (B) shows brain regions where brain activity was significantly elevated during active periods compared to rest within the block paradigm motor tasks shown in a superior view of the cortical surface and sagittal view from the midline. Panel (C) shows calculated regions-of-interest for each muscle within primary motor cortex (M1) and primary sensory cortex (S1).</p>

        <p id="P41">Salience network (SN) resting-state functional connectivity across the sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1). Development of the flatmap representation of the SN strength within the primary cohort is shown step by step as first shown (A) on the cortical fiducial surface; (B) on the inflated surface of the cortex, and (C) laid flat showing the entire cortical surface. The precentral and postcentral gyri are highlighted in the inflated (B) and flattened (C) cortical surface. Precentral (M1) and postcentral (S1) gyri are then shown independently (D) and rotated to show the medial wall on the right and lateral gyri surface on the left and annotated with ROIs from current analysis. SN resting-state functional connectivity across the sensorimotor cortex within the replication cohort is also shown (E). Local peaks in connectivity are shown in red, and are present in far lateral cortical area, mid-cortex, and medial cortex in both cohorts. Local minima with low connectivity or anti-phase connectivity are shown as white and blue, respectively, and are present in regions classically identified to represent the upper extremities and lower extremities in both cohorts.</p>
