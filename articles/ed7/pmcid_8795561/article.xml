        <title>Significance</title>
        <p>Functional MRI (fMRI) has led to tremendous advancements in brain science by allowing noninvasive mapping of functional regions in response to various stimuli and noninvasive mapping of resting-state functional connectivity. Both evoked and resting-state functional networks contain multiple brain regions that are hierarchically yet reciprocally connected.

      <abstract>
        <p>To further advance functional MRI (fMRI)–based brain science, it is critical to dissect fMRI activity at the circuit level. To achieve this goal, we combined brain-wide fMRI with neuronal silencing in well-defined regions. Since focal inactivation suppresses excitatory output to downstream pathways, intact input and suppressed output circuits can be separated. Highly specific cerebral blood volume–weighted fMRI was performed with optogenetic stimulation of local GABAergic neurons in mouse somatosensory regions. Brain-wide spontaneous somatosensory networks were found mostly in ipsilateral cortical and subcortical areas, which differed from the bilateral homotopic connections commonly observed in resting-state fMRI data. The evoked fMRI responses to somatosensory stimulation in regions of the somatosensory network were successfully dissected, allowing the relative contributions of spinothalamic (ST), thalamocortical (TC), corticothalamic (CT), corticocortical (CC) inputs, and local intracortical circuits to be determined. The ventral posterior thalamic nucleus receives ST inputs, while the posterior medial thalamic nucleus receives CT inputs from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with TC inputs. The secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) receives mostly direct CC inputs from S1 and a few TC inputs from the ventral posterolateral nucleus. The TC and CC input layers in cortical regions were identified by laminar-specific fMRI responses with a full width at half maximum of &lt;150 µm. Long-range synaptic inputs in cortical areas were amplified approximately twofold by local intracortical circuits, which is consistent with electrophysiological recordings. Overall, whole-brain fMRI with optogenetic inactivation revealed brain-wide, population-based, long-range circuits, which could complement data typically collected in conventional microscopic functional circuit studies.</p>

    <p content-type="flushleft">Functional MRI (fMRI) has led to tremendous advances in brain science by enabling noninvasive mapping of both functional regions with various stimuli and resting-state functional connectivity. Evoked fMRI can be used to detect the strength of hemodynamic responses to external stimuli (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), whereas resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) measures the degree of synchrony between fMRI time series among anatomically distinct brain regions at rest (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Both evoked and resting-state functional networks contain multiple brain regions that are hierarchically yet reciprocally connected by ascending thalamocortical (TC), descending corticothalamic (CT), corticocortical (CC), and intracortical (IC) circuits (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to determine the relative contributions of different circuits to fMRI findings to better understand brain functions and resting-state connectivity.</p>
    <p>To identify the contributions of neural networks to fMRI responses, we aimed to silence neural activity in well-defined regions via temporally specific optogenetic control of a given neural population (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Inhibiting one cortical region inevitably suppresses excitatory output to downstream signaling pathways (e.g., CT, CC, and IC pathways) (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and the down-regulated neuronal activity reflects the degree of interregional communication under basal conditions (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Therefore, fMRI with cortical inactivation is beneficial for brain-wide mapping of functional connectivity in the resting state. Similarly, local silencing during exposure to external stimuli suppresses downstream activity (output-related circuits) without compromising the upstream and/or collateral inputs from other brain regions (input-related circuits) (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); thus, downstream circuit contributions to fMRI can be determined by comparing evoked fMRI responses with and without focal inactivation.</p>
    <p>In the current study, we adopted a widely investigated somatosensory network involving multiple brain regions, such as the first-order ventral posterior thalamic nucleus, higher-order posterior medial thalamic nucleus (POm), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), and primary motor cortex (M1) (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Anatomical tracing studies have demonstrated the existence of complex monosynaptic networks across broad somatosensory-related brain areas (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In addition, microscopic functional circuits in preselected areas have been delineated using electrophysiology (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and optical recordings (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) combined with optogenetic and chemogenetic tools. Recently, macroscopic functional activity in the whole brain was mapped by fMRI (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Thus, the somatosensory system is an ideal model for investigating whether the contributions of different projections to fMRI responses can be separated.</p>
    <p>To investigate spontaneous and sensory-evoked fMRI signals at the circuit level, we combined highly specific cerebral blood volume (CBV)–weighted fMRI at an ultra-high magnetic field strength of 15.2 T with optogenetic stimulation of local GABAergic neurons using the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT)-channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)–enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) transgenic mouse line (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We examined how different cortical areas, including the primary somatosensory forelimb (S1FL), M1, and S2, affect activity in cortical and subcortical brain regions to determine causal relationships in the information flow among multiple brain areas.</p>

During two 20-s photostimulation periods (blue bars in the left example recording trace), MUAs were reduced; in the expanded view, MUA is shown to slightly increased during each pulse (blue dots) due to enhanced inhibitory activity but was near zero between pulses (yellowish orange lines) due to suppressed spontaneous activity. During 20 s of photostimulation, spontaneous activity in i) all cortical layers (200- to 1,000-µm depth) and ii) both the upper and lower eight channels was mostly suppressed by activation of inhibitory neurons. Similar uniform suppression across all cortical depths was achieved during photostimulation at the middle of the cortex (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></ext-link>).

For the CBV-weighted fMRI study, a 45-mg/kg dose of a superparamagnetic monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticle (MION) agent was injected into the animals’ blood.

(<italic toggle="yes">D</italic>) No artifactual fMRI responses to light stimulation were observed in naïve mice. To assess potential light-induced MRI artifacts, functional studies in naïve mice were conducted with interleaved FP stimulation and photostimulation of the S1FL with the same experimental protocol used for fMRI with cortical inactivation (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3). Somatosensory fMRI was used as the internal control to ensure the reliability of fMRI responses to external stimuli. Sensory-evoked fMRI responses were observed in the S1FL, but responses during photostimulation were absent in fMRI maps with and without a statistical threshold (uncorrected <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and in time courses of the S1FL. Thus, fMRI signal changes resulting from light-induced tissue heating were negligible.

(<italic toggle="yes">E</italic>) Schematic diagrams to dissect sensory-evoked, long-range, and local activity by fMRI with the assistance of optogenetic cortical inhibition. In a simplified circuit, excitatory neurons (E) interacting with inhibitory interneurons (I) in the cortex received TC inputs from the thalamus and produced spiking outputs for IC, CC, and CT downstream activity. Silencing cortical excitatory neurons by activating ChR2-expressing cortical inhibitory neurons suppressed outputs to downstream CT, CC, and IC pathways (Opto), while simultaneous FP stimulation induced sensory-evoked upstream ST and TC inputs to the thalamus and cortex, respectively (Comb). After subtracting fMRI responses to optogenetic inactivation without FP stimulation (Opto) from those with FP stimulation (Comb), the difference signal was related to upstream, input-driven responses (Diff; Comb-Opto) without the direct contribution of inhibitory neural activity. The relative contribution of downstream CT, CC, and IC pathways can be determined from the total sensory-evoked activity (Diff versus FP).

      <p>The suppression of neural activity was confirmed by recording multiunit activities (MUAs) with 16-channel optoelectrode under the same photostimulation conditions used for fMRI studies. During 20 s of photostimulation to the cortical surface of the S1FL, an increase in stimulation-induced inhibitory neuronal activity mostly suppressed spontaneous activity across all cortical depths (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>; baseline [black profile and bar] versus light on [blue profile and bar]; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6 mice), which is consistent with previous findings (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Similar uniform suppression was observed across all cortical depths when photostimulation was targeted at a depth of 500 µm in the S1FL (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></ext-link>). With 3-mW optogenetic stimulation of VGAT-ChR2, the spatial spread of inhibition was expected to be &gt;1 mm from the center of fiber (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), which covers the S1FL, M1, or S2 areas.</p>
      <p>Optogenetic fMRI of anesthetized VGAT-ChR2 mice was performed with an ultra-high magnetic field of 15.2 T. Fiber implantation often causes image distortions and signal dropouts in echo planar imaging scans commonly used for fMRI studies, which are more severe with higher magnetic fields (refer to red box of <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S3<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></ext-link>). Thus, we adopted a conventional gradient-echo imaging technique with a short echo time (TE) of 3 ms to minimize TE-sensitive blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) contributions and image distortions. This approach allowed us to identify fiber positions (refer to blue box of <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S3<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></ext-link>) and coregister brain MRI scans with the mouse brain atlas. To enhance functional sensitivity and specificity, 45 mg/kg superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were injected into the blood of the animals (reference <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S3<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></ext-link> for selection of the iron oxide dose), which resulted in CBV sensitization. An increase in CBV increased the amount of iron oxide within the voxel, thus decreasing fMRI signals. Therefore, the change in the polarity of the original CBV-weighted fMRI signal was inverted to match that of the CBV responses. Multislice CBV-weighted fMRI scans were obtained with spatial resolution = 156 × 156 × 500 μm<sup>3</sup> and temporal resolution = 2 s for mapping functional connectivity with highly specific blood volume responses. Photostimulation did not induce heating-related fMRI artifacts in naïve mice (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>; C57BL/6J, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3 mice); thus, fMRI responses to optogenetic stimulation genuinely reflected underlying neural activity.</p>
      <p>To dissect the functional circuits by fMRI, optogenetic cortical inhibition was adopted during somatosensory stimulation (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">E</italic></xref>). Silencing cortical excitatory neurons by optogenetically activating ChR2-expressing inhibitory neurons suppresses local excitatory recurrent circuits and outputs to downstream pathways (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) (Opto in <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">E</italic></xref>), resulting in a decreased fMRI signal in local and downstream networked areas (deactivation). Notably, most cortical GABAergic neurons do not project other brain regions. Therefore, this approach can be used to map spontaneous neural interactions at rest. Simultaneous forepaw (FP) stimulation during cortical silencing can preserve sensory-evoked inputs to the thalamus and cortex via upstream spinothalamic (ST) and TC pathways with downstream suppression (Comb in <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">E</italic></xref>). Since inhibitory neural activation induces a hemodynamic response at the stimulation site (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and in downstream regions, the contribution by this type of activation should be removed. It is assumed that the common photostimulation-driven hemodynamic response is completely eliminated by calculating the difference between the optogenetic fMRI responses observed with and without sensory stimulation (Comb − Opto = Diff in <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">E</italic></xref>). Therefore, the remaining signal is due to the contribution of upstream ST and TC pathways in the absence of local recurrent circuits and downstream projections from a given target region. Then, the contribution of downstream suppression of fMRI responses can be determined from somatosensory-evoked fMRI responses (Diff versus FP somatosensory stimulation in <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">E</italic></xref>), allowing us to determine the functional causality for long-range and local processing in somatosensory networks. Although a similar circuit-analysis approach of sensory stimulation with and without local silencing has been used for electrophysiological studies in preselected areas (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), fMRI with and without optogenetic inhibition can be used to determine brain-wide long-range circuits at a population level.</p>

        <title>Mapping Somatosensory Networks of Resting-State Activity: rs-fMRI versus Cortical Silencing fMRI.</title>
        <p>First, we investigated resting-state somatosensory networks by fMRI (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Pertinently, rs-fMRI connectivity, which is commonly used, is determined by synchronization of fluctuating fMRI signals between regions in the absence of a task, which is presumably related to the intrinsic network of spontaneous activity. Alternatively, optogenetic cortical silencing (in a block-design paradigm with and without 20-s optogenetic stimulation; <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref> Opto paradigm) suppresses spontaneous output activity from the stimulated site and causally reduces input to downstream networked areas (refer to actual time courses in <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S6 <italic toggle="yes">B–D</italic></ext-link>). Thus, the decrease in fMRI responses due to cortical silencing is closely related to the strength of resting-state connectivity between the optogenetic stimulation site and the connected regions.</p>

Commonly observed strong bilateral homotopic cortical connectivity was detected without a significant network between the seed ROIs and the ipsilateral thalamus (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>).

Interestingly, the S1FL and M1 had reciprocal connections with similar magnitudes, while the CT connection was stronger in the POm than in the VPL (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>).

        <p>To examine which resting-state somatosensory networks by rs-fMRI (measured by correlation analysis) and cortical silencing fMRI (measured by the signal reduction due to cortical inhibition in a resting state) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>) closely reflect intrinsic neural networks (measured by viral tracer injections), the relative connectivity strengths were quantified by normalization with the strongest connectivity in rs-fMRI (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>), with the response at the stimulation site during cortical silencing fMRI (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">E</italic></xref>) and with the projection density in tracer injection site (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">F</italic></xref>). The commonly observed bilateral homotopic connections of rs-fMRI (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) were weakly observed in networks during cortical inhibition fMRI and neural-tracing studies. In the degree of correlation with connectivity strength of neural-tracing data, rs-fMRI connectivity showed a poor similarity (r = 0.09), whereas networks by cortical silencing fMRI were well matched (r = 0.71). These indicate that the dominant bilateral cortical connectivity detected by rs-fMRI was unlikely due to direct neuron-based CC communication. Overall, brain-wide spontaneous networks in the resting state can be mapped by fMRI with inhibition at focal sites.</p>

Brain-wide activation sites were observed in the cortex, including in the S1FL, M1, S2, and thalamic nuclei, including VPL and POm (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S5<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></ext-link>). This result suggests that evoked responses to FP stimulation possibly contain ST, TC, CC, and CT pathways. To dissect the functional circuits that evoked an fMRI response, optogenetic cortical inhibition was performed at the S1FL, M1, and S2 in conjunction with FP stimulation.</p>
        <p>Initially, we investigated the relative contribution of ST and CT circuits to thalamic fMRI responses (<xref rid="fig03" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). To separate these two contributions to thalamic fMRI signals, fMRI responses to optogenetic silencing of the targeted cortex (refer to individual animal data in <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S6</ext-link>) were compared to those of simultaneous silencing and FP stimulation (refer to individual animal data in <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S7</ext-link>).

        <p>We first examined the contributions of functional pathways to somatosensory-evoked M1 responses (<xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>). M1 responses were completely suppressed when optogenetic S1FL silencing was performed (Diff [blue] versus FP [black/gray] in <xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>) but remained the same when S2 activity was silenced (Diff [red] versus FP [black/gray] in <xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>). This suggests that somatosensory-evoked M1 activity is mostly driven by CC projections from the S1FL. CC input-driven magnitude responses during M1 silencing accounted for ∼36% of the total somatosensory-evoked fMRI response in M1 (Diff [green bar] versus FP [gray bar] in <xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>). Since the input-driven CBV response duration (green line) was shorter than the duration of the total CBV response (black line), the areas under the curve (AUCs) for these measurements were also compared; this analysis revealed that the input-driven CBV response accounted for 24% of the total response. M1 somatosensory-evoked activity was shown to be driven by the S1FL feedforward projection and amplified via the IC circuitry.</p>
        <p>Then, the contributions of the TC, IC, and CC circuits to S1FL responses were separated (<xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>). Based on fMRI data acquired after M1 or S2 silencing (green or red), we found that CC projections from M1 and S2 to the S1FL were negligible during FP stimulation. This result indicated that there was no feedback CC long-range contribution to the sensory response in the S1FL, as expected under anesthesia (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). When IC activity in the S1FL was suppressed, a positive CBV response remained, with a reduced magnitude of ∼31% of that of the total stimulus-driven response (Diff [blue] versus FP [black/gray] in <xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>) and 26% of that of the total AUC.</p>
        <p>To investigate the neural source of the somatosensory-induced fMRI reduction caused by local silencing, 16-channel electrophysiological recordings with the same stimulus paradigms as fMRI (<xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">E</italic></xref>; VGAT-ChR2, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6 mice) were acquired in the S1FL.

Inhibitory neuronal activities induced by optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic neurons were subtracted from the difference between those responding to optogenetic stimulation with and without somatosensory stimulation (Diff; blue). MUAs and local field potentials (LFPs) were compared across different experimental conditions (refer to <xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 <italic toggle="yes">F</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">G</italic></xref> for averaged responses across all 16 channels and <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S8</ext-link> for depth-dependent responses). The difference between optogenetic silencing of S1FL and simultaneous silencing/FP stimulation (Diff; blue) indicated neural activities induced by TC input, whereas somatosensory-driven activity (FP) contained both long-range input and local recurrent activity (<xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">F</italic></xref>). Thus, the local recurrent activity (FP-Diff; red) can be obtained from the difference between long-range TC input (Diff; blue) and total somatosensory activity induced by forepaw stimulation (FP; reference inset figures in <xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">F</italic></xref>).

        <title>Separation of the TC, CC, and Cortico-Thalamo-Cortical Contributions to Somatosensory-Evoked S2 Responses.</title>
        <p>Finally, we examined the relative contribution of long-range TC, CC and cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) inputs and local circuits to fMRI responses in S2 (<xref rid="fig06" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The S2 area is anatomically connected to the VPL, POm, S1FL, and M1 (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Thus, functional inputs to S2 during FP stimulation can originate from monosynaptic circuits from the VPL (TC) and S1FL (CC) and disynaptic projections from the S1FL via M1 (S1FL → M1 → S2) and the POm (S1FL → POm → S2). When M1 activity was suppressed, fMRI responses at S2 remained the same (Diff [green] versus FP [black/gray] in <xref rid="fig06" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>), indicating that the contribution of the S1 → M1 → S2 pathway was negligible. The contribution of the TC projection, calculated by the difference between the signal change without and with S1FL silencing (refer to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Figs.

        <p>The synaptic inputs from the S1FL to S2 can be direct S1FL (CC) inputs and/or indirect S1FL (CTC) inputs via POm (<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Thus, our next question was whether the direct S1FL input to S2 (S1FL → S2) can be separated from CTC input (S1FL → POm → S2). Since direct S1FL inputs project to layers 2/3 (L2/3) and L5 and CTC inputs project to L4 (layer “Inputs-to-S2” schematic in <xref rid="fig06" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>) (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), upsampled cortical, depth-dependent analysis can provide an indication of whether CTC inputs are dominant in S2 fMRI responses (<xref rid="fig06" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>). Since laminar CBV responses are specific to synaptic input layers with a PSF of &lt;150 µm, its peak position provides information on cortical input layers. During FP somatosensory stimulation, laminar S2 responses were broad around L2/3 and L4 (FP in <xref rid="fig06" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref> and the black profile in <xref rid="fig06" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>). To obtain somatosensory-evoked fMRI signals originating from the VPL, the difference in cortical responses between S1FL inactivation with and without FP stimulation was obtained (Diff<sub>S1FL</sub> in <xref rid="fig06" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref> and blue profile in <xref rid="fig06" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>).

      <p content-type="flushleft">We developed fMRI approaches with highly specific CBV contrasts and local optogenetic silencing to dissect resting-state and functional brain-wide, long-range networks. Pertinently, we successfully determined the relative contribution of each somatosensory circuit to fMRI responses in mice at the population level. VPL responses originated mostly from the spinal cord, whereas the POm received functional CT projections from the S1FL (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The S1FL received somatosensory input from the VPL (<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), and M1 received feedforward CC input from the S1FL. S2 received mostly direct CC input (∼75%) from the S1FL and a small amount of TC input (∼25%) from the VPL. The long-range synaptic input in cortical areas was amplified approximately twofold by local IC circuits. Since our findings are consistent with electrophysiology studies at preselected sites (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), the fMRI approach to long-range circuit analysis is viable for mapping long-range functional circuits in the whole brain.</p>
      <p>The fMRI approach with cortical silencing can be extended for investigations of brain-wide functional circuits employing external stimuli or direct cortical stimulation. Evoked stimulation can be achieved via external or IC approaches with optogenetic or electric stimulation, activating entire networks without knowledge of the exact flow direction except for the target site. Thus, localized silencing is necessary to suppress downstream networks; this suppression can be achieved by optogenetic stimulation with high temporal specificity and pharmacological and photochemical tools for bulk interventions for specific neurotransmitter inputs to a defined brain region with low temporal specificity (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The advantage of optogenetic tools is that they provide users with the ability to perform fMRI experiments under external stimulation with and without cortical silencing in an interleaved manner; this ability is essential for signal averaging without bias by slowly modulating animal physiology during imaging studies.</p>

        <title>Focal Inhibition by Optogenetic Stimulation of Inhibitory Neurons.</title>
        <p>Optogenetic activation of cortical GABAergic neurons has been widely used in circuit/systems neuroscience (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). To identify the contribution of neural circuits to fMRI responses with optogenetic stimulation of the selected region in VGAT-ChR2 mice, it was assumed that cortical GABAergic interneurons were mostly local. Based on Allen mouse brain connectivity (<ext-link xlink:href="https://connectivity.brain-map.org/projection/experiment/167441329" ext-link-type="uri">https://connectivity.brain-map.org/projection/experiment/167441329</ext-link>), long-range projections of GABAergic interneurons were found to be negligible in the S1 barrel field. Our assumption appears to be valid in the somatosensory cortex.</p>
        <p>Another assumption was that optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic interneurons fully suppresses excitatory recurrent neuronal activities across cortical depths and downstream projections. Although the penetration depth of blue light is dependent on laser power, it is quite shallow (depth of half maximum = ∼300 µm) (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In our MUA measurements in the S1FL, optogenetic stimulation of inhibitory neurons reduced spontaneous MUA by ∼90% across cortical layers (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></ext-link>) and suppressed somatosensory stimulation-induced IC recurrent circuits (<xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">F</italic></xref>); these outcomes are possibly due to local circuits within a cortical column. In our fMRI studies, the somatosensory-evoked responses in the POm and M1 were completely suppressed when inhibitory neurons in the upstream S1FL were optogenetically stimulated, suggesting that cortical inhibition is effective in blocking downstream projections.</p>
        <p>The spatial extent of cortical inhibition is important to determine the partial volume of inhibition within the photostimulated cortical region (S1FL, M1, and S2). Li et al. (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) measured the spatial spread of inhibition beyond the target area of the somatosensory cortex in VGAT-ChR2 mice. Neural activity is suppressed by &gt;70% for 1.5-mW photostimulation and &gt;90% for 14 mW at 1 mm away from the stimulation site, far beyond the spatial spread of light (0.25 to 0.5 mm). In our case, with 3 mW optogenetic stimulation of VGAT-ChR2, the spatial spread of inhibition was expected to be &gt;1 mm from the center of the fiber. Since the sizes of S1FL, M1, and S2 in mice are ∼0.84 × 1.69, 0.82 × 1.47, and 1.56 × 1.84 mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, based on the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, the ROI was less than the area inhibited by optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic neurons. Therefore, our assumption of full inhibition is valid.</p>

        <title>Hemodynamic Responses to Inhibitory Neuronal Activity.</title>
        <p>Hemodynamic fMRI responses are believed to be mostly driven by excitatory activity (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Although GABAergic interneuron activity is known to regulate local vascular tone by the release of vasoactive mediators (e.g., nitric oxide) (<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), their activity also interacts with nearby excitatory neurons in the cortex. When inhibitory neurons were activated in VGAT-ChR2 mice, an increase in CBF and CBV was observed for &lt;5 s of stimulation (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), indicating that inhibitory neurons indeed increase hemodynamic responses. However, the increased inhibitory activity by optogenetic stimulation suppressed excitatory activity (inhibition), which led to a decrease in hemodynamic responses. Therefore, hemodynamic responses may be closely dependent on stimulus frequency and duration. Notably, we recently investigated the contribution of inhibitory neuronal activity to fMRI responses using multimodal measurements with electrophysiology, BOLD fMRI, and optical-imaging during ChR2 stimulation of inhibitory neurons in VGAT-ChR2 mice (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Under the same stimulation parameters, biphasic BOLD fMRI and CBV-weighted optical-imaging responses were observed at the stimulated site with increased inhibitory and decreased excitatory neuronal activity; an initial small positive change (by increased inhibitory activity) was followed by a prolonged negative response (by suppressed excitatory activity). In our CBV fMRI data, a biphasic response in the S1FL during the stimulation period and poststimulus overshoot were observed. The initial CBV increase was directly due to inhibitory neuron activity, as often seen in hemodynamic studies with short stimulation, and the prolonged negative change was due to the suppression of excitatory neurons (inhibition). A balance between excitation of inhibitory neurons and inhibition of excitatory neurons changes the magnitude and polarity of hemodynamic responses.</p>

        <p>In rodent rs-fMRI, a strong correlation occurs between bilateral homotopic cortices (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) but not between the cortex and thalamus in the ipsilateral hemisphere. The strong bilateral homotopic correlation is often explained by direct CC connections (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) due to the existence of monosynaptic anatomical projections (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, careful evaluation of anatomical tracing data show that ipsilateral projections among the somatosensory networks (including thalamus) are generally larger than contralateral homotopic projections (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">F</italic></xref> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2113313119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></ext-link>) (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Notably, rs-fMRI fails to detect strong ipsilateral connectivity between the cortex and thalamic nuclei within the somatosensory network; such connectivity was indeed observed in spontaneous connectivity maps generated by focal cortical inhibition. These results suggested that conventional rs-fMRI correlation strength does not truly reflect anatomical monosynaptic connections but rather common bilateral fluctuations caused by modulatory cholinergic inputs (<xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref><xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), noradrenaline driven by the locus coeruleus (<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), and thalamic low frequency (<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Further systematic studies are necessary to determine the origin of rs-fMRI connectivity.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, brain-wide spontaneous connectivity can be determined by fMRI with optogenetic silencing. In our studies, ipsilateral connections were predominant among the somatosensory network, while the connection strength between bilateral homotopic regions was ∼30% of the ipsilateral connection strength (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">E</italic></xref>). These spontaneous connectivity findings were consistent with anatomical tracing data (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">F</italic></xref>) (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Furthermore, ipsilateral, somatosensory-related regions responding to cortical inhibition overlapped with sites that were active during somatosensory stimulation. These results indicated that fMRI with cortical silencing can detect functionally networked regions. Spontaneous CT communication to the higher-order thalamic nucleus POm was stronger than that to the relay thalamic nucleus VPL, which was consistent with electrophysiological findings (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p>
        <p>Spontaneous downstream neural network strength can be measured by fMRI with cortical silencing. In our studies, the spontaneous network strength in S1FL → M1 and S2 (−2.75% and −1.98% of the peak response in L2/3) was larger than the somatosensory-evoked response (1.74% and 1.39% of the peak response). The relatively high spontaneous activity was surprising but may have been due to the use of ketamine for anesthesia (<italic toggle="yes">Effect of Anesthesia on Resting-State and Evoked fMRI</italic>).</p>
        <p>The important implication of mapping spontaneous neural communication is the identification of potential circuits that modulate behavior. Optogenetic inhibition has been used to elucidate the involvement of brain regions and specific cell populations associated with behavior. However, the neural circuits involved in behaviors could act through local or downstream circuits. Although anesthesia changes the strength of long-range connections, downstream circuits associated with behavior can be mapped by fMRI.</p>

        <title>Long-Range Input versus Local Circuit Contributions to Sensory-Evoked fMRI.</title>
        <p>Somatosensory-evoked long-range circuits were successfully dissected by fMRI. The CC circuit of S1 and M1 has been extensively investigated anatomically and physiologically (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref><xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). S1 and M1 are reciprocally connected; neural excitation in S1 rapidly propagates into neurons in L2/3 and L5A in M1, which reciprocally activate neurons in L2/3 and L5A in S1 via a feedback loop (<xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). In our studies (<xref rid="fig05" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> for the S1FL and M1 fMRI responses to FP stimulation and cortical inhibition), feedforward CC projection from S1 to L2/3 in M1 was observed for evoked and spontaneous conditions; however, reciprocal feedback projection from M1 to L2/3 and L5 in S1 was observed only for spontaneous, not evoked, conditions. It should be noted that underlying neuronal features of the downstream targets in CC projections cannot be determined with our fMRI approach, since synaptic inputs to both excitatory and inhibitory neurons can increase fMRI responses. Similarly, the sensory-evoked feedforward CC projection from S1 to L2/3 and L5 in S2 was observed without the reciprocal feedback projection. Although the S2 contributions to sensory-evoked responses in S1 and M1 were negligible in our studies, these projections may significantly contribute in other behavioral contexts, such as perception and decision-making (<xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref><xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). The differences between our study and physiological studies were likely due to anesthesia (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). To examine functional brain-wide circuits relevant to behavior, it is essential to perform fMRI on mice while they are active.</p>
        <p>In our studies, the long-range inputs and IC circuit contributions to somatosensory-evoked fMRI responses were separated. The long-range, synaptic, input-driven fMRI response in the S1FL, S2, and M1 accounted for ∼30% of the total somatosensory-evoked response. Similarly, somatosensory-evoked MUA and LFP in the S1FL were reduced to ∼35% of the total evoked neural activity by S1FL-silencing. Therefore, the suppressed response, ∼70% of the total fMRI response (∼65% for MUA and LFP), was related to local neural activity. Our finding of a greater-than-twofold increase in the IC fMRI signal was highly consistent with electrophysiology data showing an ∼2.2-fold amplification of IC in the barrel cortex (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), a 2.4-fold amplification of IC in the primary auditory cortex (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and a threefold amplification of IC in the primary visual cortex (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), in which TC and IC activities were separated with recordings of excitatory cells in L4 after optogenetic excitation of inhibitory neurons. Overall, fMRI with and without cortical inhibition can be used to identify the contributions of long-range input versus IC circuits, facilitating the detection of cortical excitatory/inhibitory imbalance and consequent dysfunction of IC recurrent circuits.</p>
        <p>We investigated the contribution of long-range cortical inputs to the POm and the VPL in the thalamus, which is consistent with a previous electrophysiology study in which somatosensory-evoked responses in the higher-order POm were drastically reduced after S1 inhibition, while first-order ventral posteromedial nucleus responses were not modulated (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). According to our data, the medial thalamic area adjacent to the POm was active during somatosensory stimulation and S1FL silencing. This observation may have been due to the spillover of POm activity with limited spatial resolution and group averaging and/or due to real activation in intralaminar nuclei, which are associated with multimodal sensory activity (<xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Thus, fMRI experiments with higher spatial resolution are needed to determine whether medial thalamic activity is genuine.</p>

        <title>Effect of Anesthesia on Resting-State and Evoked fMRI.</title>
        <p>Anesthesia affects fMRI responses in both resting and functional states. Pertinently, ketamine is known as a dissociative anesthetic that antagonizes N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors preferentially binding to GABAergic interneurons at a low dose (<xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="r70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Ketamine disinhibits basal firing of excitatory pyramidal neurons, leading to an increase in electroencephalographic activity, metabolic rate, and cerebral blood flow (<xref rid="r71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Ketamine anesthesia induces higher bilateral, homotopic, calcium-based connectivity with less spatial focality than that observed in the awake condition (<xref rid="r72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). In the functional state, ketamine (with xylazine) increases recurrent IC excitation (<xref rid="r73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>) and cortical fMRI responses (<xref rid="r74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), possibly due to disinhibition compared to that demonstrated in the awake condition. Overall, it is likely that ketamine anesthesia enhances resting-state and evoked fMRI responses in cortical areas compared to the fMRI responses noted in the awake condition.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p content-type="flushleft">Here, we successfully dissected the brain-wide somatosensory circuits underlying fMRI responses. Our fMRI approach combining stimulation and focal inhibition provides an avenue for investigating population-based neural circuits throughout the whole brain, allowing longitudinal investigations of functional reorganization caused by neuropathological modifications and learning in individual animals. Circuit-level analysis of whole-brain fMRI will complement conventional microscopic functional circuit studies by elucidating brain-wide, population-based information processing.</p>
