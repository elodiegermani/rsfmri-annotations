???,"A total of 22 healthy, right-handed participants (15 men, 7 women; mean age: 54.5 Â± 10.0 years)",Acquisition: Simultaneous PET/MRI with static 18F-FDG-PET. Analysis: ICA (20 components). Results: Similar RSNs were detected via fMRI and 18F-FDG PET when resting-state fMRI and 18F-FDG-PET data were acquired simultaneously.
???,A total of 23 patients with aMCI/AD and 23 healthy older adults,"Acquisition: Simultaneous PET/MRI with static 18F-FDG-PET. Analysis: Uptake on 18F-FDG-PET and resting-state fMRI metrics were compared between patients with aMCI/AD and controls and expressed as Z scores. Results: For within-subject PET/fMRI comparisons, correlations were high overall in healthy controls but 17% lower in patients with aMCI/AD (significant at p < 0.05). For between-subject comparisons, FDG/gICA-DR exhibited the greatest overlap around the posterior DMN nodes."
???,Amyloid-positive patients with early AD (n = 23) and amyloid-negative control participants (n = 24),"Acquisition: Separate PET (18F-THK5351, static) and MRI (3T). Analysis: Seed-based connectivity analysis was performed by generating seed ROIs based on regions exhibiting the most significant differences in 18F-THK5351 retention between patients with AD and controls. Results: Patients with AD exhibited significant decreases in connectivity between the PCC and widespread brain regions."
???,A total of 16 patients with MDD without comorbidities and 15 healthy controls,"Acquisition: Separate PET [(11C)ABP688, dynamic] and MRI (3T). Analysis: The BPND of [11C]ABP688 was quantified using the SRTM for mGluR5 availability. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was performed using resting-state fMRI data with regions derived from quantitative [11C]ABP688 PET as seeds. Results: Patterns of correlation between [11C]ABP688 BPND and the strength of functional connectivity involving the superior prefrontal cortex were opposite in the depression and control groups."
???,A total of 16 patients with MDD and 14 controls,"Acquisition: Simultaneous fMRI and 11C-raclopride PET targeting the dopamine D2 receptor. Analysis: BPND was estimated via the MRTM, using the cerebellum as the reference tissue. Functional connectivity analysis was performed using striatal regions exhibiting significant between-group BPND differences as seeds. Results: Increased BPND and decreased connectivity were observed in the striatum. The BPND was increased in both the left ventral striatum and right dorsal striatum in patients with MDD. Connectivity between these regions and cortical targets was also decreased in the MDD group."
