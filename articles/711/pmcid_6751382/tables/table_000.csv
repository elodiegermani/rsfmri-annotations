Term,Definition
Magnetoencephalography (MEG),MEG is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that can be used to detect extremely weak magnetic fields generated by spatially aligned neurons that are simultaneously activated. The measured MEG signal originates from postsynaptic currents in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons.
Neural oscillations,Assemblies of neurons influence each other through excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections which leads to rhythmic activation and inhibition of neurons in the network. The rhythmic activity is reflected in oscillating signals that can be measured outside of the scalp with EEG and MEG.
Phase,"The phase of periodic oscillation, i.e., an oscillation which repeats itself exactly after one period (e.g., sinusoidal wave) indicates the fractional portion of the period that has been completed. The phase is typically expressed as an angle spanning a whole turn (2Ï€) as the oscillation goes through a period. In the context of neural oscillations, the phase reflects the excitability state of the neurons and therefore the phase influences the discharge times of the neurons in the network."
Functional connectivity,Functional connectivity refers to statistical associations or temporal correlations between two or more anatomically distinct brain regions.
Phase coupling,"The term phase coupling refers to the relationship between oscillation phases in different brain regions. More specifically, in this work, the term phase coupling is used to indicate the presence of peaks in the distribution of the phase difference across time or signal realizations (e.g., trials, or different segments into which continuous signals can be divided). Phase coupling is considered to be a fundamental neural mechanism that supports neural communication, neural plasticity and it is considered relevant for many cognitive processes. In the literature also the term phase synchronization is used as a synonym of phase coupling."
Communication through Coherence (CTC),CTC refers to the concept that only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact efficiently. The concept is grounded in the fact that neural oscillations are associated to neuronal excitability fluctuations. Only when inputs from presynaptic group consistently arrive to the postsynaptic group at the time of high input gain (at appropriate phase) the two groups can effectively communicate. This requires coherence between the pre- and postsynaptic groups since otherwise the inputs arrive at random phases of excitability state and will have less impact on the postsynaptic neurons.
