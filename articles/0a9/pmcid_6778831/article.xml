        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Mindfulness meditation training has been shown to increase resting-state functional connectivity between nodes of the frontoparietal executive control network (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]) and the default mode network (posterior cingulate cortex [PCC]). We investigated whether these effects generalized to a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course and tested for structural and behaviorally relevant consequences of change in connectivity. Healthy, meditation-naïve adults were randomized to either MBSR (<italic>N</italic> = 48), an active (<italic>N</italic> = 47) or waitlist (<italic>N</italic> = 45) control group. Participants completed behavioral testing, resting-state fMRI scans and diffusion tensor scans at pre-randomization (T1), post-intervention (T2) and ~5.5 months later (T3). We found increased T2–T1 PCC–DLPFC resting connectivity for MBSR relative to control groups. Although these effects did not persist through long-term follow-up (T3–T1), MBSR participants showed a significantly stronger relationship between days of practice (T1 to T3) and increased PCC–DLPFC resting connectivity than participants in the active control group. Increased PCC–DLPFC resting connectivity in MBSR participants was associated with increased microstructural connectivity of a white matter tract connecting these regions and increased self-reported attention. These data show that MBSR increases PCC–DLPFC resting connectivity, which is related to increased practice time, attention and structural connectivity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mindfulness meditation practice aims to improve well-being through training attention to present-moment experience (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Kabat-Zinn, 1990</xref>). There is growing evidence that mindfulness meditation training improves multiple aspects of attention and executive functioning, including improved working memory (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Zeidan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), decreased rumination and distraction (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Jain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and decreased mind-wandering (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Mrazek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Moreover, decreases in mind-wandering mediated improvements in cognitive performance following mindfulness meditation training (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Mrazek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). These behavioral changes following mindfulness practice suggest dynamic alterations in brain networks responsible for implementing attention and executive function.</p>
      <p>The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is the central hub of the default mode network (DMN; <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Spreng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), which is a set of brain regions in which activation is correlated at rest and is associated with mind-wandering and self-referential processing in task-based fMRI (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Mason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Andrews-Hanna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). A cross-sectional study of long-term mindfulness meditation practitioners by <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Brewer <italic>et al.</italic> (2011</xref>) found reduced activation of this network at rest and during meditation practice, which was interpreted as reflecting reduced mind-wandering and increased focus on present moment experience. However, research to date has not provided direct, supporting evidence for this interpretation. <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Brewer <italic>et al.</italic> (2011</xref>) also found increased resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the PCC and a node of the frontoparietal executive control network (FPN), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), in long-term mindfulness practitioners compared to non-meditators, suggesting a functional mechanism by which attentional improvements and reductions in mind-wandering may manifest. The FPN coordinates activation between the DMN and the dorsal attention network, for example for top-down modulation of mind-wandering (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">MacDonald <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Smallwood <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Nodes of the FPN, including DLPFC, are also active during mind-wandering, and one interpretation infers this activation as constraining or regulating mind-wandering (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Christoff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Christoff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). A recent study found that PCC–DLPFC RSFC also increased following short-term mindfulness meditation training relative to an active control intervention (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Creswell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p>
      <p>Despite this progress, prior research is limited by small sample sizes, use of non-standard interventions, lack of meaningful behavioral correlates and failure to include diffusion-weighted measures of structural connectivity. In the present study we evaluated the impact of the most commonly used mindfulness intervention—Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). MBSR is manualized, widely available and has been adapted for use in a variety of populations and contexts (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Kabat-Zinn, 1990</xref>). Furthermore, arguments regarding the practical significance of mindfulness meditation-related changes in functional connectivity would be more compelling if these findings were mirrored by changes in the microstructure of pathways connecting these regions, and/or accompanied by alterations in behavioral processes served by these networks.</p>
      <p>In the current study we sought to conceptually replicate and extend prior work showing that short-term mindfulness meditation training increases PCC–DLPFC RSFC in a randomized controlled trial of MBSR. We employed a validated, active control intervention well-matched to MBSR, the Health Enhancement Program (HEP) (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">MacCoon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and utilized a sample size that was approximately double that used in prior research (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Creswell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). We defined a PCC seed and PFC target region of interest (ROI) based on coordinates reported in <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Creswell <italic>et al.</italic> (2016</xref>); we refer to this region as ‘LPFC’, as these coordinates are anterior and ventral to the canonical DLPFC that is part of the FPN. We also investigated PCC connectivity with a more canonical, anatomically-defined DLPFC target ROI, the middle frontal gyrus (MFG; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Petrides and Pandya, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Ptak, 2012</xref>) from the Harvard-Oxford Atlas (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Craddock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). We examined individual differences in practice duration to determine whether there was a dosage effect on changes in RSFC. Finally, we investigated associations between increased PCC–DLPFC RSFC and decreased mind-wandering, and with microstructural connectivity of a white matter tract connecting PCC and DLPFC, the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Thus, the current study enables us to examine with rigorous design and methodology, the efficacy of mindfulness meditation training in altering the structure and function of brain circuits associated with mind-wandering and attention and their behavioral correlates.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>This study is registered as a clinical trial with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02157766).</p>
      <sec id="sec3">
        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>We recruited 140 healthy human participants (average age 44.3 ± 12.8 years; 83 female) from Madison, WI, and the surrounding community using flyers, online advertisements and advertisements in local media. Recruitment materials described the study as researching ‘the impact of health wellness classes on the brain and body’. Sixteen participants had RSFC data excluded from baseline analysis due to excessive motion (described below; <italic>n</italic> = 11) or anatomical brain abnormalities as determined by a radiologist (<italic>n</italic> = 5). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups following baseline data collection: MBSR, the HEP active control group, or a waitlist control group (WL). Participants were block randomized following stratification based on gender (male and female) and age (25–39, 40–50 and 51–65 years). The intervention procedures were identical to those detailed by <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">MacCoon <italic>et al.</italic> (2012</xref>). Twenty-nine additional participants were excluded from analysis of pre/post-differences: 16 participants withdrew prior to T2; 6 participants were excluded for failure to attend more than 1 HEP or MBSR class; 1 participant had poor data quality (severe signal dropout in PFC); 1 participant was excluded for medical reasons; and 5 participants were excluded due to excessive motion during the T2 scan. Thus, there were 31 MBSR (average age 41.4 ± 12.9 years; 18 female), 34 HEP (average age 43.6 ± 13.1 years; 22 female) and 30 WL (average age 43.0 ± 12.0 years; 19 female) participants in analyses of T2–T1 RSFC. An additional 10 participants withdrew prior to T3 and 3 were excluded for excessive motion at the third scan, resulting in 29 MBSR (average age 41.1 ± 13.5 years; 17 female), 27 HEP (average age 43.7 ± 13.4 years; 16 female) and 29 WL (average age 44.0 ± 11.7 years; 18 female) for T3–T1 RSFC analyses. A subset of participants completed the Emotional Styles Questionnaire (ESQ), which was introduced subsequent to the onset of data collection due to availability of the measure: 25 MBSR (average age 40.2 ± 12.5 years; 12 female), 24 HEP (average age 42.0 ± 13.5 years; 13 female) and 21 WL (average age 41.6 ± 10.6 years; 12 female).</p>
        <p>Participants were excluded if any of the following applied, due to their potential impact on the current analyses or other aspects of the larger study in which they were enrolled: regular use of psychotropic or nervous system altering medication; psychiatric diagnosis in the past year or history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; color blindness; currently participating in another clinical trial; current asthma diagnosis; currently diagnosed with a sleep disorder or regularly taking prescribed sleeping medications; current night shift worker; significant training or practice in meditation or mind-body techniques such as yoga or Tai-Chi; expert in physical activity, music or nutrition (for HEP); any history of brain damage or seizures; medical problems that would affect the participant’s ability to participate in study procedures. Written, informed consent was obtained from all participants according to the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">WMA, 2013</xref>) and the study was approved by the Health Sciences Institutional Review Board at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>

        <title>Data collection</title>
        <p>Participants completed a baseline data collection visit prior to randomization, a second visit following the 8-week intervention period and a third visit ~5–6 months after the second visit. At each of these times, participants attended a 24 h laboratory visit that included an MRI scan and the ESQ (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Kesebir <italic>et al.</italic>, n.d.</xref>) among other measures as part of a larger multisession, multiproject study. The ESQ consists of a 1–7 Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree. One of the ESQ subscales provided a measure of attention that was most relevant to the hypotheses of the current study, and items included ‘I do not get distracted easily, even when I am in a situation in which a lot is going on’ and ‘I sometimes feel like I have very little control over where my attention goes’ (reverse-coded). Experimenters were blind to the group assignment during data collection. All participants were given monetary compensation for their participation.</p>

        <title>Experience sampling</title>
        <p>Experience Sampling was conducted during the week prior to and following the intervention period (14 days total). Participants provided their cellular phone numbers and available 8 h periods for each of the 14 days. Participants had a choice of receiving text messages six, seven or eight times a day, and received a text message every 90 min on average. The text message contained a question assessing mind-wandering: ‘Was your attention on the activity you were performing?’ Participants were asked to respond with a number from 1 (attention is not on the task) to 9 (attention is completely on the task at hand). On average participants responded to 82% of text messages they received. The response window was set to the time between two successive messages such that participants were given until the next message arrived to respond to the current message. If participants sent two responses in-between messages, the second response was discarded. The ratings across all 7 days of the week for each time period (pre/post-intervention) were averaged to obtain a mean attention rating for each participant at T1 and T2.</p>

        <title>Image acquisition</title>
        <p>Images were acquired on a GE MR750 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil. Anatomical scans consisted of a high-resolution 3D T1-weighted inversion recovery fast gradient echo image (450 ms inversion time; 256 × 256 in-plane resolution; 256 mm field of view (FOV); 192 × 1.0 mm axial slices). A 12 min functional resting-state scan run was acquired using a gradient echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (360 volumes; repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)/Flip, 2000/20 ms/75°; 224 mm FOV; 64 × 64 matrix; 3.5 × 3.5 mm in-plane resolution; 44 interleaved sagittal slices; 3 mm slice thickness with 0.5 mm gap). The in-plane resolution was decreased after the first 21 participants from 3.5 × 3.5 to 2.33 × 3.5 mm to better address sinus-related artifacts, resulting in a matrix of 96 × 64. Diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) were acquired with single-shot spin-echo EPI sequence (TR/TE/Flip, 8575/76.6 ms/90<sup>o</sup>; 75 × 2 mm interleaved sagittal slices; 2.0 mm isotropic voxels). In total, 63 DWIs were acquired along non-collinear diffusion encoding directions across three <italic>b</italic>-values of 500/800/2000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> (9/18/36 directions, respectively), while six additional images with no diffusion encoding (i.e. <italic>b</italic> = 0 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) were acquired. Parallel acquisition with a geometric reduction factor of two was used to reduce image acquisition time and distortions from magnetic field inhomogeneities. The total time for the multiple <italic>b</italic>-value DTI acquisition was 10 min.</p>

        <p>Functional images were processed using a combination of AFNI (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Cox, 1996</xref>) (versions 17.3) and FMRI Expert Analysis Tool Version 6.00, part of FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL; <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), including the following steps: removal of the first four volumes, motion correction with MCFLIRT (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Jenkinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), BET (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Smith, 2002</xref>) brain extraction and registration of the subject’s functional data with their anatomical image using the boundary-based registration approach (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Greve and Fischl, 2009</xref>). A 12 degrees of freedom (DOF) affine transformation using FLIRT (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Jenkinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) was followed by FNIRT nonlinear transformation to register each subject’s functional data to Montreal Neurological Institute 152 space. Images were segmented into white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid with FAST for use as masks that were eroded using a 3 × 3 × 3 voxel kernel and then used to generate ROI-averaged time series serving as nuisance regressors (along with their derivatives and the six motion regressors) with AFNI’s 3dDeconvolve. Images were smoothed with a 5 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel.</p>
        <p>We extracted the time series from a spherical PCC seed with a 4 mm radius defined based on coordinates from <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Creswell <italic>et al.</italic> (2016</xref>). We regressed this time series back onto each subject’s data using AFNI’s 3dDeconvolve, which also censored high-motion time points (&gt;0.2 mm framewise displacement; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Power <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Participants were excluded from analysis if they had &lt;6 min of data due to &gt;50% of data points censored for motion. Two sets of target ROIs were defined: a bilateral DLPFC ROI, based on MFG from the Harvard-Oxford atlas (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Craddock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) thresholded at 50% probability for small-volume-corrected voxelwise analysis, which was split into left and right for ROI analysis, and left and right LPFC ROIs defined as 10 mm spheres around coordinates provided in <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Creswell <italic>et al.</italic> (2016</xref>). Resting-state fMRI connectivity was assessed based on the Fisher-Z transformed (FZT) correlation between the PCC seed and every other voxel in the brain for the voxelwise analysis and separately for each of the target ROIs.</p>

Brain extraction was performed using FSL’s BET tool (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Smith, 2002</xref>), and maps of diffusion tensors were calculated using the robust estimation of tensors by outlier rejection (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Chang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) algorithm as implemented by the diffusion imaging in python open-source package (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Garyfallidis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).

        <p>A population-specific template was created from a representative subset of the subject data to minimize coordinate system induced bias. Affine and diffeomorphic registration as implemented in DTI-TK (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) were used for estimating the spatial transformations. Data from the individual subjects were spatially normalized to the estimated population-specific template. The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) ICBM-DTI-81 FA template (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Mori <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) was co-registered to our population-specific FA template using diffeomorphic registration as implemented by the Advanced Normalization Tools (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Avants and Gee, 2004</xref>) software package. Deep white matter labels included as part of the JHU template were warped into the space of our population-specific template using nearest neighbor interpolation. Right and left hemisphere SLF ROIs were then inverse warped to the native space of each participant using the inverse of the subject-specific spatial transformation obtained from DTI-TK. Median FA, MD, RD and AD in these subject level SLF ROIs were then calculated. The median was used over the mean in order to be robust to outlier voxels within the ROIs.</p>

        <p>The analysis plan for this study was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/vrmz9/register/5771ca429ad5a1020de2872e">https://osf.io/vrmz9/register/5771ca429ad5a1020de2872e</ext-link>. The analytic plan said linear models looking at T2 and T3 adjusting for T1 would be used, but we instead used T3–T1 and T2–T1 differences in our models, for consistency with analyses in other studies that were part of the larger project in which this study was embedded. We also changed the cutoff for the maximum number of TRs censored for motion from 25% to 50%, given that the resting-state scans were about twice as long in duration than those in prior studies on which this cutoff was defined. Analyses of baseline data regressed the T1 measures on group or other variables of interest. For each analysis examining changes due to MBSR, we computed difference scores (T2–T1 or T3–T1), which were regressed on group to test the effect of MBSR compared to HEP or to WL. Within-group analyses tested the intercept of the linear model for the difference score, reflecting whether or not the change in the dependent variable was significantly different than zero. Comparisons between two different variables regressed the difference score for one variable on the difference scores for the second variable. All tests were conducted using linear models from the ``lm'' function (for linear modeling) in the stats package in R (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team, 2015</xref>). All analyses included covariates for age and gender, and analyses of RSFC included an additional covariate for the change in the resting-state scan acquisition (as described above). Significance of results were consistent regardless of inclusion of the covariates, except where noted in the text. All results are reported after removing outliers based on Cook’s D, with a cutoff threshold of 4/(N-P) for data points disconnected from the distribution (where <italic>N</italic> = sample size and <italic>P</italic> = number of parameters in the model) as determined by the modelCaseAnalysis function of the lmSupport package (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Curtin, 2015</xref>) in R (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team, 2015</xref>).

        <p>In order to test for intervention effects, we computed difference maps for the T2 or T3 map subtracting the T1 map. We assessed the effects of mindfulness meditation on PCC–DLPFC RSFC by extracting the average RSFC FZT difference score across two sets of ROIs: (i) the anatomically-defined DLPFC ROI (split between left and right hemispheres of the Harvard-Oxford-defined MFG) and (ii) two spheres of 10 mm radius in left and right LPFC centered on coordinates provided by <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Creswell <italic>et al.</italic> (2016</xref>). The anatomical DLPFC ROIs provided a means to examine connectivity in a more ‘canonical’ DLPFC region than the spherical ROIs defined from <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Creswell <italic>et al.</italic> (2016</xref>) and were also broader than the spherical ROIs. In addition, we examined group differences in a voxelwise fashion within the DLPFC ROI. We conducted a secondary voxelwise analysis across the whole brain to identify other regions that might differ in connectivity between groups and to test for specificity of changes to PCC–DLPFC RSFC. Voxelwise analyses were thresholded at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 controlling for family-wise error (FWE) using threshold-free cluster enhancement with FSL’s randomize (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Winkler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p>
        <p>Within the MBSR group, we tested relationships between PCC–DLPFC RSFC and two measures of mind-wandering as potential behaviorally relevant outcomes of stronger connectivity between these regions: self-reported attention on the ESQ (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Kesebir et al., n.d.</xref>) and experience sampling of mind-wandering via text messaging. We included difference scores of the attentional measure as a covariate of interest for each participant in a voxelwise analysis within the anatomical DLPFC. We also examined this relationship in an ROI analysis by extracting the average PCC RSFC from the left and right anatomical DLPFC ROIs, which were entered as the independent variables in linear models with the attention measure (T2–T1 for both variables).</p>

        <title>DTI analysis</title>
        <p>We tested whether MBSR-related changes in PCC–DLPFC RSFC were associated with changes in the SLF using DTI measures. The median values for FA, MD, RD and AD of the SLF ROIs were entered into a principle component analysis (PCA; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Zeestraten <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">McLaughlin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), using the prcomp function in R (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team, 2015</xref>) to construct a right and left hemisphere composite of the underlying microstructure. The first principle component was used as a representative composite of white matter microstructure, as this accounted for the greatest covariance between the four DTI parameters (77.1% for the right and 80.0% for the left). The factor loadings for FA, RD, MD and AD were 0.44, −0.54, −0.56 and −0.45 for the right side, respectively; and 0.45, −0.53, −0.56 and −0.46 for the left side, respectively. Thus, larger values of the microstructure composite are indicative of higher anisotropy and lower diffusivity, which is generally interpreted as a superior white matter microstructure (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Basser and Jones, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we found evidence that MBSR—one of the most widely used mindfulness meditation interventions—increased RSFC between nodes of the DMN and the FPN compared to well-matched active and passive control groups. Previous research has found similar effects following a brief mindfulness intervention relative to relaxation training (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Creswell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), as well as in cross-sectional research of long-term practitioners (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Brewer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). A large and growing body of research has implicated the DMN in mind-wandering, task-unrelated thought and self-referential processing, whereas the FPN is associated with externally-oriented and goal-directed attention (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Spreng and Grady, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Barrett and Satpute, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Spreng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Given that one of the primary skills trained during mindfulness meditation is directing attention to present moment experience without elaboration (unlike during typical self-referential processing), increased PCC–DLPFC RSFC could reflect a greater ability to attend to task-related stimuli and increased control over self-referential processing and mind-wandering.</p>
      <p>The group differences in RSFC were localized to MFG, which is a more canonical region of the DLPFC (and of the FPN; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Petrides and Pandya, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Ptak, 2012</xref>) that is posterior and dorsal to the regions reported by <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Creswell <italic>et al.</italic> (2016</xref>). In contrast, we failed to replicate prior findings using an ROI based on the exact coordinates provided by this prior study. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting the anatomically-defined DLPFC region should be involved in attentional processes that shift with mindfulness training (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Fox <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), whereas the LPFC ROI is based on coordinates from a single study and is likely less reliable. Although there were no significant group differences in PCC–DLPFC RSFC in the voxelwise analyses, we report the subthreshold results given that the pattern is consistent with the significant group difference in the anatomical DLPFC ROI analysis, and to provide a complete picture of the data. However, subthreshold results alone are not evidence of a group difference, given the possibility of false positives. The significant increase in PCC–DLPFC RSFC within MBSR participants in the voxelwise analyses adds further evidence to this pattern of results implicating MBSR practice with improved connectivity between the DMN and FPN.</p>
      <p>There was an unanticipated, significant group difference in the voxelwise analysis, whereby MBSR participants had increased PCC–ITG RSFC relative to HEP. While there was no difference between MBSR and WL in PCC–ITG RSFC, this result appears to be driven by the significant increase for the MBSR group, as there was no change for HEP (or WL). The ITG has been considered part of the FPN (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and reduced ITG RSFC has been associated with aging-related cognitive impairment (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Han <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Agosta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Increased PCC–ITG RSFC may therefore reflect improved cognitive function. However, future research is needed to replicate this finding in a confirmatory analysis.</p>
      <p>Importantly, we also found a group difference in the relationship between practice and change in PCC–DLPFC RSFC, whereby it was stronger for MBSR relative to HEP. The more time participants spent practicing MBSR, the stronger their PCC–left DLPFC RSFC became—representing a linear dosage effect at this early stage of training. There was no significant relationship for HEP practice and PCC–DLPFC RSFC. Since participants in the MBSR group did not all engage to the same degree with practicing mindfulness meditation, the intervention should not lead to an equivalent change across MBSR participants as a group. This interaction of an individual differences measure with group is strong evidence that MBSR practice played a causal role in the RSFC changes, particularly given the significant main effect of group on change in PCC–DLPFC RSFC.</p>
      <p>While the group difference in changes in brain connectivity was not sustained at the later follow-up, continued practice with MBSR may be necessary to maintain this effect. Our finding that days of MBSR practice between T1 and T3 were positively associated with increasing strength of RSFC of this network over the same time period adds support to this hypothesis. Future research should seek to replicate this effect since it was not pre-registered in this study, and to examine whether individuals who continue to practice mindfulness meditation following MBSR and incorporate the practices into their daily lives experience more lasting change. For example, future studies may extend this line of research by following participants further out in time and examining whether participants engage in mindfulness practices when dealing with stressors <italic>vs</italic> solely as a sitting practice.</p>
      <p>Increased PCC–DLPFC RSFC following MBSR training was associated with increased white matter microstructure of a tract linking these regions, the SLF, in an exploratory analysis. Decreased diffusivity and increased fractional anisotropy in white matter may reflect a more streamlined white matter fiber organization (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Beaulieu, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Alexander <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Zatorre <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, changes in DTI-based measures are non-specific and may stem from various alterations to the underlying microstructure (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Cercignani, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Thus, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying such changes still require future investigation. While the white matter microstructure of the entire group of MBSR participants’ SLF did not change significantly following the intervention, our findings highlight the importance of examining individual differences, since it was only for those who showed more substantial changes in functional connectivity that we observed alterations in white matter structural connectivity. Future research should examine relationships between structural and functional connectivity in this network in a confirmatory manner to replicate these findings.</p>
      <p>While we also found an association between increased PCC–DLPFC RSFC and self-reported attention, as theorized, the relationship was only present in an exploratory analysis with a different measure than hypothesized in our pre-registration. The questionnaire measure utilized in the current study (ESQ) is also new, and the nomological network associated with individual differences on this measure remains to be determined. It will be important for future research to conceptually replicate this result with a validated ESQ or other validated self-report measure. Moreover, there was no relationship between changes in PCC–DLPFC RSFC and mind-wandering as measured by experience sampling following MBSR, contrary to our hypothesis. It is possible that the experience sampling measure in the current study assays a different aspect of attention than that which is supported by PCC–DLPFC connectivity, and/or that this measure is insufficient for measuring MBSR training-related changes. It is critical to identify behavioral measures associated with MBSR-related increases in PCC–DLPFC RSFC in order to more fully understand the relevance of such changes in brain connectivity. The ideal test would identify behavioral improvements following MBSR that are mediated by increased PCC–DLPFC RSFC.</p>

        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p>In the current study we found a mixture of positive and negative results, across confirmatory and exploratory analyses. Strong conclusions regarding the effect of MBSR training on PCC–DLPFC RSFC are limited, given that group differences in the voxelwise analysis were non-significant and the <italic>P</italic>-values of the ROI analyses change from 0.04 to 0.05 in two cases when correcting for multiple comparisons. While our pre-registered analysis of the <italic>a priori</italic> anatomical ROIs provide support for the conclusion that MBSR strengthens PCC–DLPFC RSFC, further research is needed to replicate these effects. Replication of the results of multiple exploratory analyses is also needed, including relationships with practice, structural change of the SLF and increased self-reported attention. Moreover, the questionnaire measure we utilized (ESQ) remains to be validated. Finally, results of the whole-brain analysis revealed an unanticipated difference in PCC–ITG RSFC between MBSR and HEP that was non-significant for MBSR compared to WL. Since this group difference in PCC–ITG RSFC was the result of secondary, exploratory analyses, we are hesitant to over-interpret this novel result, which needs to be replicated in future confirmatory research. We offered a tentative interpretation that such RSFC changes may reflect improved cognitive function as an idea for further exploration.</p>
        <p>This study provides evidence of training-related changes following practice with mindfulness meditation in brain networks important for executive control and modulation of mind-wandering with relevant outcomes in self-reported attention. Individual differences in practice time and structural changes associated with PCC–DLPFC RSFC changes suggest the importance of continued practice beyond the formal instruction period. Future research to examine potential longer-term changes may need to consider factors that contribute to adopting mindfulness meditation practice as a lifestyle change, similar to the need for continued exercise and healthy eating for maintenance of healthy weight. Potential avenues to facilitate long-term use of mindfulness meditation practice may be through tailoring practices for incorporation into activities of daily living, availability of ongoing training exercises, greater accessibility of training support through mobile platforms and a meditation community. Given the wide use and efficacy of MBSR for treating numerous mental health conditions (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), as well as the growing evidence of behaviorally-relevant biological changes as described in this study, the future of mindfulness meditation research should aim to determine factors that predict lasting change.</p>
