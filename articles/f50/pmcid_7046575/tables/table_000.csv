Group ICA,Multivariate method that decomposes spatially independent but temporally coherent networks,Distinct ICNs correspondent to functionally relevant networks,(Mckeown et al. ???; Calhoun et al. ???),"- Reliable and consistent functional connectivity patterns- Data driven, no assumptions about ROIs-Noise extracted as component/s",- Number of components unknown- No reproducibility due to random assumption at the beginning of iterative process- Networks identified a posteriori with spatial templates,n.s,↓DMN-rAngrelated to ↓E and ↑P2
ECM,Graph-based method that weights nodes based on their correlations with other nodes within the network,Functional relevance and hierarchy of a node within the brain network,(Bonacich ???; Lohmann et al. ???),"- Describe and characterize intrinsic properties of the brain network- Parameter-free, not depending on prior assumptions- More sensitive to subcortical regions",- Analytic approaches are computationally difficult- Ambiguous measure difficult to relate to specific cognitive function,n.s,↑Hipp2
ALFF,Strength of BOLD-signal fluctuation by the total power within a range of 0.01–0.08 Hz,Spontaneous local oscillatory activity,(Zang et al. ???),- Characterize spontaneous local brain activity-Conceptually straightforward and easily implemented,"- Sensitive to physiological, neural and artifactual factors",n.s,"↑Cdrelated to ↓E and ↑P1,2"
Seed based connectivity,Temporal correlation of a neurophysiological index from a selected “seed region” and all other voxels in the brain,Functional connectivity patterns,(Biswal et al. ???),- Straightforward analytical approach and comprehensible results,- Seed regions need to be selected a priori,↑rCd-rMFG1,↑lPut-rThrelated to ↑E1
