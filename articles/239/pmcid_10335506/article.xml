          <title>Objective</title>
          <p>Τo determine whole-brain and regional functional connectivity (FC) characteristics of patients with neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) or without neuropsychiatric manifestations (non-NPSLE) and examine their association with cognitive performance.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data was performed in 44 patients with NPSLE, 20 patients without NPSLE and 35 healthy controls (HCs). Volumetric analysis of total brain and specific cortical and subcortical regions, where significant connectivity changes were identified, was performed. Cognitive status of patients with NPSLE was assessed by neuropsychological tests. Group comparisons on nodal FC, global network metrics and regional volumetrics were conducted, and associations with cognitive performance were estimated (at p&lt;0.05 false discovery rate corrected).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>FC in patients with NPSLE was characterised by increased modularity (mean (SD)=0.31 (0.06)) as compared with HCs (mean (SD)=0.27 (0.06); p=0.05), hypoconnectivity of the left (mean (SD)=0.06 (0.018)) and right hippocampi (mean (SD)=0.051 (0.0.16)), and of the right amygdala (mean (SD)=0.091 (0.039)), as compared with HCs (mean (SD)=0.075 (0.022), p=0.02; 0.065 (0.019), p=0.01; 0.14 (0.096), p=0.05, respectively). Hyperconnectivity of the left angular gyrus (NPSLE/HCs: mean (SD)=0.29 (0.26) and 0.10 (0.09); p=0.01), left (NPSLE/HCs: mean (SD)=0.16 (0.09) and 0.09 (0.05); p=0.01) and right superior parietal lobule (SPL) (NPSLE/HCs: mean (SD)=0.25 (0.19) and 0.13 (0.13), p=0.01) was noted in NPSLE versus HC groups. Among patients with NPSLE, verbal episodic memory scores were positively associated with connectivity (local efficiency) of the left hippocampus (r<sup>2</sup>=0.22, p=0.005) and negatively with local efficiency of the left angular gyrus (r<sup>2</sup>=0.24, p=0.003). Patients without NPSLE displayed hypoconnectivity of the right hippocampus (mean (SD)=0.056 (0.014)) and hyperconnectivity of the left angular gyrus (mean (SD)=0.25 (0.13)) and SPL (mean (SD)=0.17 (0.12)).</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>By using dynamic CRQA of the rs-fMRI data, distorted FC was found globally, as well as in medial temporal and parietal brain regions in patients with SLE, that correlated significantly and adversely with memory capacity in NPSLE. These results highlight the value of dynamic approaches to assessing impaired brain network function in patients with lupus with and without neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>SLE is a chronic, multisystem, autoimmune disease which is often accompanied by an assortment of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression and cognitive difficulties (neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE)).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Despite efforts to establish universally accepted diagnostic protocols,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> the pathophysiological substrate of these symptoms remains elusive. Small vessel vasculopathy and vasculitis may constitute a common element underlying aberrant brain function<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> through altered, regional haemodynamics.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> We have shown that regionally impaired brain perfusion may be associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms that are directly attributed to the disease (primary NPSLE).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Changes in cortical thickness<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> and reduced volume in medial temporal structures (the hippocampus) have also been reported.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
      <p>Functional brain imaging studies on patients with NPSLE are relatively scarce, relying on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to derive measures of functional brain connectivity (FC). In the earliest attempt to assess FC in patients with NPSLE, Nystedt <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported both reduced and increased FC in patients with NPSLE as compared with healthy controls (HCs) within several, a priori-defined networks.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Our group has applied whole-brain FC network modelling techniques,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> targeting individual variability in FC network structure, in the presence of largely unknown anatomical and haemodynamic alterations in a highly heterogeneous disease. According to these studies, patients with NPSLE displayed increased nodal connectivity, as compared with age-matched volunteer HCs, indexed through Intrinsic Connectivity Contrast (ICC), in the superior parietal lobule bilaterally (SPL and precuneus) and in the left angular gyrus.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> The opposite trend (NPSLE&lt;HC) was found in the temporal poles and in several dorsolateral (the superior and middle frontal gyri, bilaterally) and ventromedial prefrontal sites. There is further evidence that the degree of disturbance in FC involving these regions and, in addition, in a key medial temporal structure (the amygdala) correlates with the severity of emotional symptoms among patients with NPSLE.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
      <p>Interestingly, studies using conventional metrics of regional inter-relations, such as Pearson correlation, have failed to reveal evidence of reduced FC in medial temporal structures in NPSLE, as compared with healthy volunteers. This approach is not suitable to reveal similarities in dynamic behaviour between BOLD time series recorded from distinct brain regions. There is, however, growing evidence that regional brain activity displays deterministic characteristics, as evidenced by such dynamic phenomena as recurrence,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and its extension to the examination of similarities in the dynamic behaviour of two time series, known as cross-recurrence.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Examination of the cross-recurrence plots through cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) provides several complementary metrics characterising the joined, dynamic behaviour of two brain regions.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> We have recently applied CRQA to assess dynamic FC between pairs of regions comprising the sensorimotor network in patients with NPSLE and HCs. Results revealed significant hypoconnectivity between primary and associated sensorimotor cortices, the degree of which correlated positively with the fine motor speed and visuomotor coordination.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Importantly, CRQA measures displayed far greater sensitivity than conventional FC metrics derived from Pearson correlations in both identifying group differences and in revealing FC–behaviour associations.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
      <p>In this work, we report on unique FC characteristics of patients with NPSLE using a novel connectivity metric adapted to explore whole-brain network function. Specific objectives of the present study were the following: (a) to effectively integrate multiple, complementary CRQA metrics in computing person-specific whole-brain functional networks reflecting dynamic cortico-cortical inter-relations; (b) to identify aberrant connectomic features in patients with NPSLE as compared with age-matched and gender-matched HCs and with a smaller group of patients who did not manifest neuropsychiatric symptoms; (c) to establish the significance of dynamic measures of FC for residual cognitive function in NPSLE.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>Patients diagnosed with NPSLE (n=44) or non-NPSLE (n=20) were recruited by their attending physician from the registry of the Rheumatology Clinic, University of Crete General Hospital. Inclusion criteria were: (a) SLE diagnosis according to the revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1997 classification criteria;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> (b) NPSLE diagnosis, according to the ACR nomenclature,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> by their physician through a multidisciplinary approach which considered patient age and risk factors for NPSLE (anti-phospholipid antibodies, prior neuropsychiatric manifestation, generalised disease activity, findings of conventional MRI and other diagnostic procedures); (c) age over 18 years. Exclusion criterion was history of thromboembolic cardiovascular disease or other primary central nervous system diseases, elicited through history or evident on MRI. Two patients with chronic infarctions and one with intraparenchymal haematoma were excluded from the study. Data from the same cohort of patients and healthy volunteers have been used in previous publications employing conventional connectivity metrics and time shift analysis.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Preliminary results restricted to intrinsic somatomotor network FC using CRQA have also been reported previously.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
        <p>The vast majority of patients with NPSLE were women (42 of 44), aged 19–65 years (mean (SD)=44.1 (12.7), IQR=37.3–54 years) ranging between 1 and 25 years since SLE diagnosis (mean (SD)=6.3 (6.1), IQR=2.0–9.3 years). All but one patient were right-handed. Most patients with NPSLE presented with relatively mild disease activity at the time of testing according to the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI-2000,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> with only five patients scoring ≥9; mean (SD)=4.5 (3.0)). They also displayed relatively mild organ damage according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/ACR Damage Index (SDI<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) with only three patients scoring ≥1 (mean (SD)=0.34 (0.57)). They presented with a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms (primarily psychiatric (23 patients), cognitive (8 patients) and lupus headache (8 patients)). Nineteen patients received glucocorticoid treatment, 20 were treated with azathioprine and 3 with ciclosporin.</p>
        <p>Patients without NPSLE were mostly women (19 of 20), right-handed and aged 19–65 years (mean (SD)=48.3 (13.6), IQR=39.5–55 years). Illness duration ranged between 1 and 40 years (mean (SD)=9.7 (13.0), IQR=2.0–12.0 years). At the time of testing, their SLEDAI scores averaged 4.5 points (SD=3.1; only one patient scored ≥9) and showed relatively mild organ damage (only four patients had SDI scores ≥1; mean (SD)=0.37 (0.95)). Nine patients received glucocorticoid treatment and eight were treated with azathioprine.</p>
        <p>The rs-fMRI data obtained under identical scanning parameters and procedures were available for 35 age-matched (mean (SD)=42.9 (15.4), p&gt;0.1) and gender-matched, right-handed HCs (32 women, p&gt;0.4).</p>

        <p>Neuropsychological testing was performed on 35 patients with NPSLE specifically aiming to include tests recommended by the ACR<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> (described in more detail in the <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material</xref>). Corresponding neuropsychological data were available on only 12 patients without NPSLE which were not sufficient for correlational analyses. All tests have been normed in the Greek adult population permitting conversion of raw scores on each of the 10 available neuropsychological indices of working memory, episodic verbal memory, executive function, visuoconstructive ability, and processing speed into age-adjusted and education-adjusted standard (z) scores.</p>

        <p>Brain MRI examinations were performed on a clinical 1.5 T MRI scanner (Vision/Sonata, Siemens/Erlangen), equipped with high-performance gradients (Gradient strength: 40 mT/m, slew rate: 200 mT/m/ms) and a two-element circularly polarised head array coil. Conventional MRI protocol consisted of a three-dimensional T1-weighted MPRAGE, a T2-weighted turbo spin echo, a turbo fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, a gradient echo and a diffusion-weighted imaging sequence. Images were interpreted by a senior neuroradiologist (EP), with 20 years of experience, blinded to the clinical and laboratory data, who reported any incidental findings not related to SLE, or findings related to focal SLE-related abnormalities, such as acute or old infarcts, haemorrhages and focal brain atrophy.</p>
        <p>rs-fMRI was derived from a T2*-weighted, fat-saturated two-dimensional FID-EPI sequence (TR=2300 ms, TE=50 ms, FOV=192×192×108 mm). Acquisition voxel size was 3×3×3 mm, and whole-brain scans consisted of 36 transverse slices acquired parallel to the plane passing through the anterior and posterior commissures (AC-PC line with 3.0 mm slice thickness and no interslice gap).</p>

        <title>fMRI data preprocessing and denoising</title>
        <p>Each BOLD time series consisted of 150 dynamic volumes (the first three were ignored in all subsequent analyses). Preprocessing steps included slice-time correction, realignment, segmentation of structural data, normalisation into standard stereotactic Montreal Neurological Institute space and spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full width at half maximum using SPM V.12. As FC is affected by head motion in the scanner, we accounted for motion artefact detection and rejection using the artefact detection tool (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>White matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mean signals were regressed out of all voxel time series in order to mitigate their effects on fMRI BOLD time courses. The first five principal components of white matter and CSF regions were regressed out of the signal as well as their first-order derivatives. These steps were completed using CompCor implemented within the CONN preprocessing module<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and executed in MATLAB.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The fMRI time series were detrended and bandpass filtered in the 0.008–0.09 Hz range, to eliminate low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise.</p>

        <title>Whole-brain functional network estimation</title>
        <p>Parcellation of functional data was achieved via the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Regional time series were computed as the mean of voxel time courses within each anatomical region defined by the AAL, resulting in ROI 90 time series used for the calculation of CRQA-based FC networks. RQA attempts to quantify the amount, type and pattern of ‘recurrence’ in pairs of regional time series. The bivariate extension of RQA and CRQA aims to find similarities between pairs of state vectors corresponding to two distinct phase space trajectories with equal embedding dimension. More details on the application of CRQA to estimate cortico-cortical connectivity can be found in Pentari <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Here we extend this method to study whole-brain FC represented by a total of 4005 connections (ie, functional associations among the 90 AAL regions across the duration of the entire fMRI scan).</p>
        <p>Six types of networks were computed via the CRQA approach, each based on one of six complementary indices of recurrence (recurrence rate, determinism, average diagonal line length, maximal diagonal line length, entropy, maximal length of vertical lines, normalised to the range of 0–1), as well as a single network via the Pearson correlation coefficient, totalling seven functional networks per individual. In order to effectively combine the information of these different types of networks, we adopted a data-driven approach, which was proposed for combining different types of structural connectivity and improving reliability.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> These metrics were linearly combined based on appropriate coefficients computed through the graph diffusion distance metric (GDD).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The GDD is based on a graph Laplacian exponential kernel and models the patterns of information flow among hypothetical sensors located on each network. A 7×7 matrix of dissimilarity values between all pairs of network types was created, individually for each participant, with higher values corresponding to greater dissimilarities in topology due to differences in hypothetical information flow. The normalised sum of each row of this distance matrix served as each individual network’s weight. The normalisation ensured that all weights summed to one. After multiplying each network with its corresponding weight, all networks were summed (weighted average) resulting in a final integrated network. Next, the integrated functional network was reduced in order to obtain only the most prominent connections, indicating the optimal underlying structure. Orthogonal Minimum Spanning Tree<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> was used for this purpose, a data-driven topological filtering approach based on retaining the subnetwork that facilitates optimal information flow.</p>
        <p>In the final step, individual subject functional networks were used for the calculation of several network measures. The entire process of network construction, integration and final metric calculation is illustrated schematically in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>. Global measures included global efficiency, a measure of generalised integration or information flow, modularity, describing functional segregation/decomposability or a network’s tendency to form several strongly connected communities, with few connections among each other. The networks’ tendencies towards a more ‘optimal’ small world structure, balancing integration and segregation and maximising information capacity, are encapsulated by the small world propensity measure.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Next, local or nodal measures were computed, better characterising the behaviour of each individual brain region in the network. Local efficiency is equivalent to global efficiency calculated on the neighbourhood of a given node. Three measures of centrality were also computed in order to quantify each region’s ability to act as a functional hub or go-between, facilitating overall communication between other nodes. The more basic is node degree, based on the number of connections a node possesses. Betweenness centrality measures node importance based on the number of strong connections the node is located between and thus helps mediate. Eigenvector centrality is a self-referential measure of centrality, that is, a node with high values of eigenvector centrality must be connected to other nodes with increased values.</p>

Individual group distributions and differences in these regions are shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>. The non-NPSLE group also showed reduced FC (eigenvector centrality) of the right hippocampus as compared with HCs (mean (SD)=0.056 (0.013), p=0.05). Differences between non-NPSLE and HC groups in the left hippocampus (mean (SD)=0.061 (0.014)) and right amygdala (mean (SD)=0.111 (0.075)) were not significant (p&gt;0.1).

        <p>In addition, compared with the HC group, patients with NPSLE displayed hyperconnectivity of the SPL bilaterally (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6</xref>), whereas a similar trend in the non-NPSLE group was restricted to the right SPL.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The main novel finding of the present study is that patients with NPSLE display reduced intrinsic connectivity in two key medial temporal lobe structures (hippocampus and amygdala), accompanied by reduced amygdala volume, as compared with age-matched and gender-matched healthy volunteers. As patients without NPSLE also presented evidence of reduced volume of the amygdala bilaterally, reduced FC as compared with HC was restricted to the right hippocampus. A second novel finding is that patients with NPSLE displayed greater FC network modularity as compared with HC participants. In addition, the current results replicate previous findings from our group (based on conventional (static) FC measures<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref>) concerning hyperconnectivity of parietal regions (left angular gyrus and SPL) in SLE, regardless of the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms, using complementary indices of FC.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Finally, the present study reveals that connectivity in the left hippocampus and left angular gyrus correlated with verbal episodic memory capacity of patients with NPSLE. These findings are discussed in turn in the following paragraphs.</p>
      <sec id="s4-1">
        <title>Medial temporal hypoconnectivity in NPSLE</title>
        <p>Data regarding the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory in patients with autoimmune disorders are virtually non-existent. Nevertheless, extant evidence clearly suggests that left medial temporal cortex, and especially the hippocampus, plays a more important role than the corresponding right hemisphere structures in episodic verbal memory. Specifically, greater left than right hippocampal activation is typically found during memory tasks that involve verbal material<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> in healthy participants. Moreover, task-related FC of the left hippocampus with perisylvian areas correlated positively with AVLT performance among patients with medial temporal epilepsy.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Importantly, resting-state FC of the left, and not the right, hippocampus correlated significantly with AVLT performance among cognitively non-impaired elders at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s dementia.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p>
        <p>The hippocampus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction in SLE<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 34–40</xref> by both animal and human studies reporting hippocampal neuronal damage, atrophy and hypermetabolism. Few neuroimaging studies revealed reduced hippocampal volume in patients with NPSLE as compared with HCs as well as patients without NPSLE.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 34</xref> Even more, relatively lower hippocampal volume, even in patients without NPSLE, correlated with SLE disease activity.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Reduced hippocampal volume was also found in patients with SLE with cognitive deficits and no other neuropsychiatric manifestations, when compared with their counterparts without cognitive deficits.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The current results extend these findings to show that functional hippocampal connectivity within the left, dominant hemisphere is also impaired in NPSLE. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of medial temporal hypoconnectivity in the non-NPSLE group although restricted to the right hippocampus, pending confirmation in a larger sample.</p>
        <p>Crucially, the degree of hippocampal hypoconnectivity accounted in part for reduced verbal episodic memory in individual patients with NPSLE, which was noted in one-third of the patients in the current study in accordance with previous studies.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41–43</xref> It appears, therefore, that spared FC of the left hippocampus with the rest of the brain is important for preserved memory function of patients with NPSLE. This finding highlights the value of dynamic indices of FC, as afforded by the novel application of CRQA, toward detecting aberrant brain function, given that individual differences in hippocampal volume did not appear to account for significant individual variability in memory capacity.</p>
        <p>We also found reduced intrinsic FC of the right amygdala in the NPSLE in comparison with the HC group. Interestingly, both SLE groups showed reduced amygdala volume as compared with HC, bilaterally, yet hypoconnectivity of this structure was restricted to patients with NPSLE. These findings extend previous reports of reduced volume of amygdala in patients with SLE with cognitive deficits than patients without cognitive deficits<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and decreased node degree in the right amygdala of patients with SLE.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Reduced static connectivity (based on Pearson correlations between regional time series) of the lateral temporal poles was also found in NPSLE as compared with HCs.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Taken together, these results highlight a potential increased vulnerability of the anterior temporal lobes to NPSLE pathophysiology that may play a role in the emergence of cognitive and emotional difficulties in this illness.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s4-2">
        <title>Parietal hyperconnectivity in NPSLE</title>
        <p>The present results corroborate and extend previous findings of static, intrinsic hyperconnectivity of parietal regions obtained in the same cohort of patients with NPSLE in comparison with HCs.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> These regions included posterior default mode network (DMN) components (SPL bilaterally) and the left angular gyrus.</p>
        <p>Regarding SPL, hyperconnectivity was accompanied by reduced cortical volume (in the right hemisphere) in agreement with results from an independent sample of patients with NPSLE<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and by increased haemodynamic lag (bilaterally) in the current cohort of patients with NPSLE.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
        <p>Hyperconnectivity of the left angular gyrus was observed in patients with NPSLE and patients without NPSLE as a robust finding, given that it was supported by three complementary measures of BOLD signal interdependency (derived from CRQA) and was also evident on static FC analyses (derived from Pearson correlation metrics<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In general, these results are consistent with growing evidence that patients without NPSLE may also display functional brain alterations, although generally milder than those found in patients with NPSLE.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref></p>
        <p>In contrast to SPL, the left angular gyrus did not display significant cortical atrophy in the present study or aberrant perfusion dynamics in either group of patients with SLE.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Interestingly, hyperconnectivity of the left angular gyrus has been documented in at least one other condition (cerebral small vessel disease),<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> characterised by widespread cerebral perfusion disturbances, whereas a similar finding has been recently reported in another inferior parietal region (the supramarginal gyrus<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). However, hyperconnectivity of either region with the rest of the brain was negatively associated with cognitive performance in both the present study and another previous study of our group.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> It is thus difficult to rely on previous findings of task-related activations in these regions or on associations between resting-state FC and cognitive performance in healthy participants to help interpret the present findings in a pathological condition. Therefore, we can only surmise as to why left angular hyperconnectivity did not appear to be beneficial to verbal episodic memory capacity based on the fact that this region is considered as one of the major connecting hubs of the resting-state networks<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and part of the DMN,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and as such it consistently shows deactivation during task performance in healthy participants.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Along these lines, it is possible that increased connectivity of this region with the rest of the brain may indicate a general tendency toward reduced attention to external stimuli among patients with NPSLE, which was in turn reflected in relatively lower episodic memory performance. At the same time, the angular gyrus, as a heteromodal region, has demonstrated considerable capacity to undergo plasticity-like structural changes in the healthy adult brain.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> In this context, resting-state hyperconnectivity could, alternatively, reflect a compensatory, although ineffective, attempt to engage a structurally and haemodynamically viable, cortical region, possibly in response to reduce functionality of medial temporal structures that are indispensable to verbal episodic memory.</p>

        <title>Global changes in FC</title>
        <p>Regional upregulation and downregulation of connectivity, and especially in parietal association cortices (left angular gyrus), were paralleled by evidence of greater network segregation, indexed by increased modularity, restricted to the NPSLE group.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that this result was derived from purely data-driven analysis procedures, preserving individual differences in overall network structure and function. Although the role of resting-state network modularity for overall brain function has only recently been studied systematically, there is evidence that higher network segregation is characteristic of the ageing brain,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> patients with extratemporal epilepsy<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> and is associated with lower cognitive performance.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> In patients with lupus, increased modularity is consistent with previously reported disturbances in FC between major, a priori-defined, functional networks in SLE and NPSLE.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> They found reduced (static) connectivity within the DMN and central executive networks as well as between these two networks in both patients with NPSLE and patients without NPSLE. Conversely, hyperconnectivity was found within the sensorimotor network. Our results can thus be considered as complementary to the findings of Nystedt <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> as the present work relies primarily on nodal connectivity which reflects similarities in the evolution of the BOLD signal over time using a novel FC metric (CRQA). Importantly, the nodal FC estimates presented here indicate the relative functional role of each brain region within the entire functional resting-state network which was in turn derived using graph theory-based algorithms. This refined network comprised the most significant nodes and edges that characterise each participant.</p>
        <p>A final note is in place regarding the potential utility of the CRQA technique as a complementary means to assess FC from rs-fMRI data. CRQA proved to be more sensitive in detecting reduced hippocampal FC than static FC than conventional metrics of cross-regional functional associations used in earlier analyses of the same dataset. Moreover, CRQA-derived indices of global brain network function helped to account for relatively reduced episodic memory capacity in a clinically challenging patient group. Our results underscore the potential benefits from taking into account recurrent patterns in the signals recorded from distinct brain regions, to derive indices of cross-regional similarities in haemodynamic activity as it evolves over time.</p>
        <p>Finally, the current findings highlight the importance of taking into account individual differences in FC networks when computing indices of FC (static or dynamic). This approach may be even more crucial in patients known to have variable regional haemodynamic and white matter disturbances which are likely to affect the internal structure and function of networks defined a priori based on work on the normal brain.</p>

      <sec id="s4-4">
        <title>Study limitations</title>
        <p>The present results should be interpreted with caution in view of certain study limitations. Thus, the group of patients without NPSLE is much smaller than the NPSLE group and corresponding comparisons should be considered as tentative, in view of low achieved statistical power to reveal relatively small group differences. Moreover, neuropsychological data were available on few patients without NPSLE not permitting examination of associations between FC indices and memory performance.</p>
        <p>Although associations with memory test scores found in the present study reflect moderate effect sizes, they indicate that several additional factors play a critical role in determining cognitive performance (in addition to measurement error in both cognitive test scores and rs-fMRI recordings and derived indices). Moreover, structural changes not visible on conventional MRI sequences, such as subtle white matter disturbances, may underlie, at least in part, the observed associations.</p>
        <p>It is also important to emphasise the cross-sectional nature of associations between connectivity measures and cognitive performance. Longitudinal data involving multiple measurements of multiscale data are necessary in order to establish causative links between clinical and psychometric indices of the impact of the disease and the evolution of changes in brain function in patients with SLE. Even more, a rather liberal multiple comparison correction method (FDR) was applied in the analyses. Further studies with larger samples and more stringent statistical thresholds (based on family-wise error rate) are warranted to confirm our findings.</p>

        <title>Clinical implications</title>
        <p>The diagnosis of NPSLE is currently rather complex, mainly based on clinical criteria, while the diagnostic utility of conventional MRI is limited.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The current rs-fMRI study, using a dedicated dynamic CRQA of whole-brain FC, proved to be more sensitive than static FC analysis in detecting connectivity disturbances, especially in the left hippocampus and angular gyrus, that correlate with verbal episodic memory in patients with NPSLE. Subsequently, the present study offers further insights into the specific brain network pathophysiological changes that relate to memory disturbances in these patients, which may assist clinical diagnosis and lead to more targeted and effective treatments.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The present results highlight a complex mechanism of functional adaptation of the brain to NPSLE, which may account for individual patterns of cognitive preservation and difficulties. Dynamic CRQA of rs-fMRI data revealed global and regional FC disturbances in patients with NPSLE. In particular, patients with NPSLE displayed more segregated functional networks, indicated by greater FC network modularity, and aberrant FC disturbances in medial temporal and parietal structures, compared with HCs. CRQA proved to be more sensitive in detecting reduced hippocampal FC than static FC. Moreover, connectivity changes in the left hippocampus and left angular gyrus were significantly correlated with verbal episodic memory disturbances of patients with NPSLE. Patients without NPSLE displayed less extensive FC changes, restricted to hypoconnectivity of the right hippocampus and hyperconnectivity of left parietal regions. These findings might assist the diagnostic procedure of NPSLE and lead to more effective treatment of cognitive impairment of these patients.</p>
