Method,Sliding window correlation (SWC),Phase synchrony (PS),Co-activation patterns (CAP),Quasi-periodic patterns (QPP)
Summary,Finds FC within brief (âˆ¼60s) windows. Repeating at each time-step along the full duration.,Finds the instantaneous phase of each voxel timeseries using a Hilbert transform. Calculates synchrony between phase angles of each voxel pair at each timepoint.,"Cluster timepoints of BOLD data directly. Often performed on signal peaks above a given threshold (i.e., top 15%) for each voxel.",Searches the BOLD timeseries to find repeating spatiotemporal sequences of activation with the specified window length.
