      <abstract>
        <p>Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) exhibits time-varying patterns of functional connectivity. Several different analysis approaches have been developed for examining these resting-state dynamics including sliding window connectivity (SWC), phase synchrony (PS), co-activation pattern (CAP), and quasi-periodic patterns (QPP). Each of these approaches can be used to generate patterns of activity or inter-areal coordination which vary across time. The individual frames can then be clustered to produce temporal groupings commonly referred to as “brain states.” Several recent publications have investigated brain state alterations in clinical populations, typically using a single method for quantifying frame-wise functional connectivity. This study directly compares the results of k-means clustering in conjunction with three of these resting-state dynamics methods (SWC, CAP, and PS) and quantifies the brain state dynamics across several metrics using high resolution data from the human connectome project. Additionally, these three dynamics methods are compared by examining how the brain state characterizations vary during the repeated sequences of brain states identified by a fourth dynamic analysis method, QPP. The results indicate that the SWC, PS, and CAP methods differ in the clusters and trajectories they produce. A clear illustration of these differences is given by how each one results in a very different clustering profile for the 24s sequences explicitly identified by the QPP algorithm. PS clustering is sensitive to QPPs with the mid-point of most QPP sequences grouped into the same single cluster. CAPs are also highly sensitive to QPPs, separating each phase of the QPP sequences into different sets of clusters. SWC (60s window) is less sensitive to QPPs. While the QPPs are slightly more likely to occur during specific SWC clusters, the SWC clustering does not vary during the 24s QPP sequences, the goal of this work is to improve both the practical and theoretical understanding of different resting-state dynamics methods, thereby enabling investigators to better conceptualize and implement these tools for characterizing functional brain networks.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) is a powerful tool for non-invasive examination of brain networks in healthy cognition, aging, disease, etc., but the traditional time-averaged approach only gives a summary of what happens over the course of the scan. Time-varying rsfMRI methods provide deeper insight into the brain’s functional architecture and the large-scale changes in activity that play out over the course of a scan (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Keilholz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Preti et al., 2017</xref>) and have been shown to correlate with underlying neural activity (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Tagliazucchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Keilholz, 2014</xref>) and behavior (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Liegeois et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
      <p>Several analysis methods have been proposed to capture time-varying activation and deactivation of functional networks throughout the brain. Some are based on the pattern of activity across the brain, while others specifically examine how the relationship between areas evolves over time. The temporal resolution of the technique is related to the length of the window used, which can range from a single TR to more than a minute. These analysis methods result in a time-varying series of matrices, which are often condensed into a handful of brain states using clustering techniques (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hutchison et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, there is little consensus about which analysis methods or parameterizations should be used, and as a result, researchers tend to choose methods somewhat arbitrarily. The wide variety of approaches hinders the comparison of findings obtained with different methods. Here we compare the outcomes for three different dynamic analysis methods coupled with k-means clustering and applied to the same data set, to provide insight into the similarities and differences of the results. A brief summary of each rsfMRI dynamic analysis method can be found in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

        <title>Sliding Window</title>
        <p>One of the most common techniques for examining time-varying rsfMRI is a sliding window (SWC) correlation analysis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Glover, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Keilholz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Preti et al., 2017</xref>). Based on widely-used methods for calculating average functional connectivity (FC) as the correlation between brain areas over the course of the entire scan, in SWC, the fMRI timeseries is segmented using a time window of length <italic>w</italic> (typically 30–60s) and the correlation between pairs of brain regions is calculated for each window at every timestep.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S1.SS2">
        <title>Phase Synchrony</title>
        <p>Phase synchrony (PS) is similar to the sliding window approach, except the window length is reduced to a single timeframe by using Hilbert (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Glerean et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cabral et al., 2017</xref>) or wavelet (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Glover, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Yaesoubi et al., 2015</xref>) transformations to obtain the instantaneous phase of the timeseries at each timepoint, then the PS between pairs of brain regions can be calculated. As with the sliding window approach, k-means clustering (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Yaesoubi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cabral et al., 2017</xref>) can then be applied to identify temporal dynamics.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S1.SS3">
        <title>Co-activation Patterns</title>
        <p>Another approach to the analysis of single timeframe rsfMRI is to examine co-activation patterns (CAP) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to the phase synchrony approach, CAP analysis identifies simultaneous occurrence of BOLD signal peaks or troughs in different brain regions independent of signal phase. The relationship between the BOLD signal and neural activity has been shown to arise from the temporally sparse events which form the basis of CAP analysis (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). CAP analysis typically utilizes k-means clustering to identify different CAPs and this allows temporal dynamics to be identified and potentially compared to other time-varying rsfMRI methods including SWC and PS.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S1.SS4">
        <title>Quasi-Periodic Patterns</title>
        <p>Finally, one alternative to temporal clustering of single timeframes is to identify spatiotemporal patterns which occur repeatedly over sequences of frames (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Majeed et al., 2011</xref>). Quasi-periodic patterns (QPPs) observed through this type of analysis represent a known dynamic feature of rsfMRI (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Yousefi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bolt et al., 2021</xref>) and have been shown to correlate with neural activity (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2014</xref>). The strongest QPP typically consists of a sequence displaying a transition between a period of strong activation of default-mode network (DMN) and deactivation of sensory and attention networks to a period of DMN deactivation coupled with activation of sensory and attention networks (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abbas et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Yousefi and Keilholz, 2021</xref>).</p>
        <p>We examine the relationship between brain states formed using SWC, PS, or CAP analysis, and investigate how each one classifies QPPs observed in the dataset. Our findings highlight commonalities and disparities across the methods and provide some insight into the sensitivity of various approaches.</p>

        <title>Data and Preprocessing</title>
        <p>The minimally preprocessed grayordinate and FIX de-noised rsfMRI of the HCP S900 release (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Van Essen et al., 2012</xref>) consisting of 817 individuals with four complete rsfMRI scans (1,200-timepoints, TR = 0.72s) were downloaded and preprocessed for previous studies (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Yousefi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Keilholz et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, each timeseries was demeaned and bandpass filtered (0.01–0.1 Hz), and global (white matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and gray matter) signals were regressed. The spatial dimension was reduced to 360 cortical parcels (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>) and each parcel’s timeseries was z-standardized. The first scan of the first day for each subject was used in all calculations of time-varying FC.</p>

      <sec id="S2.SS2">
        <title>Sliding Window Connectivity Analysis</title>
        <p>Square 60s windows (83 timepoints), overlapping for all but a single timepoint, were utilized for the sliding-window analysis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Shakil et al., 2016</xref>). The Pearson correlation for each parcel-pair was calculated and Fisher transformed to normalize the variance during each 60s time-window from the first timepoint and at each ensuing time-step (1TR = 0.72s) with windows overlapping except for a single timepoint. A symmetrical 360 × 360 matrix of pairwise values for all brain regions was obtained for each window (1,117 per scan = 1,200 total timepoints–window length) and a vector-by-time matrix containing a single value for each of the 64,620 parcel-pairs (equivalent to the lower triangle of the 360 × 360 matrix) at each timepoint served as the input for the clustering algorithm to define brain states.</p>

      <sec id="S2.SS3">
        <title>Phase Synchrony Analysis</title>
        <p>The instantaneous phase was calculated at every timepoint by taking the Hilbert transform for each parcel. The phase synchrony between each parcel-pair was then computed as the cosine of the difference in phase angles at each timepoint. A vector-by-time matrix of 64,620 pairwise phase synchrony values was obtained for each timepoint and used as the input for the clustering algorithm.</p>

      <sec id="S2.SS4">
        <title>Co-activation Pattern Analysis</title>
        <p>The original CAP analysis applied an activation threshold (often top 15% or z-score &gt; 1) to a seed region and averaged BOLD frames across all suprathreshold timepoints (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Duyn, 2013</xref>). Further work extended CAP analysis to a more data driven, whole-brain approach by performing k-means clustering directly on the BOLD timeseries data (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). For the present study we performed k-means clustering of the 360 parcels at each timepoint. In order to display cluster centers in a comparable format to the other methods, after clustering, the 360 elements of each centroid were multiplied with themselves generating a 360 × 360 outer-product matrix for each cluster center.</p>

        <title>K-Means Clustering</title>
        <p>Clustering was performed in MATLAB using the k-means function with k = 5 as the cluster number, correlation distance as the distance metric, and 30 replications per run for each of the SWC, PS, and CAP methods. Each of these methods generated a 2D vector-by-time matrix of values for all 360 parcels (CAP) or 64,620 parcel-pairs (SWC/PS) at every timepoint (1,200/scan for PS/CAP) or every time window (1,117/scan for SWC). For each dynamic analysis method, the vector by time matrices were initially clustered for each individual scan. The cluster centroids (means) from all individual scans were then clustered by k-means using the same parameters to generate group-level cluster centroids. The group-level centroids were the used to initialize clustering of all timepoints across all individuals. This iterative clustering process has been utilized in previous studies of brain dynamics (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and greatly reduces the computational time and resources required for large datasets.</p>
        <p>Selecting an appropriate number of clusters is a critical part of this type of dynamic analysis. Larger numbers of clusters can potentially provide more information but increasing the cluster number greatly increases computation time and can make interpretation more challenging by increasing complexity and reducing the distinction between clusters. For this study, preliminary results were generated using a range of 3–10 clusters on a subset of 20 subject scans (but otherwise the same methods described above). These preliminary results are displayed in <xref rid="VS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Materials</xref> for k = 3, 7, and 10 clusters. Based on these initial observations, k = 5 clusters were selected as a sufficient number to provide an effective comparison between the different dynamic analysis methods. While the ideal cluster number may vary for the different approaches, it was important to use a consistent number for this comparative analysis.</p>

Weighted cluster averages were computed for each method as a comparison to time-averaged functional connectivity by taking the mean of the five cluster centroids weighted by the state occurrence rates.

Chi-square goodness of fit tests were used to test for overlap in the composition of states identified by the different analysis methods. The occurrence rates of each state over all 980,400 timepoints were input as the expected frequency and compared against observed frequencies to determine overlap in state composition.

Clear differences are evident between the three methods, particularly between CAP and the other two. The SWC and PS centroids all somewhat resemble the plot of time-averaged FC over the entire dataset, except with some variations in the levels of correlation within major networks and considerable variation in correlations between major networks. Qualitatively, the PS centroids appear quite similar to SWC centroids but with slightly greater variation between the states. In stark contrast are the CAP centroids, which appear to capture periods dominated by activation of specific networks and display a much greater degree of variation across states. The weighted cluster averages for each method closely resemble, and were strongly correlated to, the time-averaged FC with <italic>r</italic> = 0.994, 0.998, and 0.863 for SWC, PS, and CAP averages respectively.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>One of the challenges involved in interpreting time-varying connectivity metrics in the current literature is that each approach is sensitive to a different aspect of the brain’s dynamics. Here for the first time, we look for an explicit relationship between these different dynamic analysis methods applied to the same dataset, providing a basis for understanding the relationship between different analysis approaches.</p>
      <p>The results provide a detailed comparison between brain states obtained with the four dynamic analysis methods: SWC, PS, CAPs, and QPPs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the differences between these methods are shown to result in prominent differences in brain states identified by k-means clustering despite each method closely reproducing time-averaged FC when the states are averaged sequentially (as shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In particular, the results indicate that SWC with a 60s window length may not provide the necessary temporal resolution to capture important features of brain dynamics, such as QPPs, that occur on shorter time scales. This is clearly illustrated by the much longer dwell times for SWC states, which might be expected from the temporal smoothness caused by the 60s windows overlapping by all but a single timepoint of offset. While the 60s window length is a common choice for SWC, the use of a shorter window would likely produce a more similar result to the PS method, however there is evidence that the use of very short SWC windows can potentially introduce spurious correlations (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Leonardi and Van De Ville, 2015</xref>). See <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Shakil et al. (2016)</xref> for an extensive evaluation of SWC parameters for dynamic analysis.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile PS and CAP analysis both provide superior temporal resolution at the level of a single timepoint, but each produces quite different brain states following k-means clustering due to the underlying features each method is sensitive to. This point is demonstrated by how each of these two methods captures QPPs. PS is sensitive to correlations between regions and frequently categorizes the entire QPP into brain state 1 because of the prominent anti-correlation of the DMN to sensory and attention networks that characterizes the QPP. Intriguingly the probability of PS state 1 is highest during the transition period between the QPP peak and trough, likely indicating that this transition is the period of greatest coherence of the regional signal trajectories. Meanwhile, because CAP analysis is sensitive to signal amplitude the first phase of the QPP, when DMN is activated, is categorized into states 1 and 2 while the second phase of the QPP, when sensory and attention networks are activated, is categorized into states 3, 4, and 5 but almost never states 1 or 2. This finding could potentially explain the unexpected result of longer dwell times for PS compared to CAP as each QPP results in a greater number of CAP state transitions than PS state transitions. A similar relationship is observed when the data is analyzed without global signal regression. The QPPs are frequently categorized into a single PS state (especially during the mid-QPP phase transition period) while each phase of the QPP is mostly categorized into different CAP states and SWC states do not make any specific transitions during the QPPs.</p>

        <title>How to Choose the Best Dynamic Analysis Method for a Study</title>
        <p>Sliding window connectivity may still be advantageous relative to time-averaged functional connectivity for comparisons between groups (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Damaraju et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hindriks et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Menon and Krishnamurthy, 2019</xref>) and window lengths shorter than the 60s used for this study may produce results closer to the PS method. However, PS and CAP methods do provide noteworthy advantages for dynamic analysis. In additional to capturing information at shorter time scales, each can potentially be performed without an arbitrary window length selection. While the CAP analysis for this study did not employ an activation threshold, performing clustering directly on the BOLD data, seed-based CAP analysis commonly utilizes an arbitrarily selected threshold that could influence the results (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez-Barragan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, PS does not require the investigator to set any specific parameters, but the data is commonly bandpass filtered (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cabral et al., 2017</xref>) into frequency bands (typically 0.01–0.1 hz or lower) which is likely to reduce sensitivity to dynamics at higher frequencies. CAP analysis also offers the advantage of reduced dimensionality and computation time given the clustering is performed on data from N parcels rather than (N-1)*N/2 parcel pairs. However, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cabral et al. (2017)</xref> have shown that PS (and potentially SWC) analysis can be effectively performed on the leading eigenvector of the parcel pairs, reducing the dimensionality to the same number N and producing similar results.</p>
        <p>Investigators may also wish to consider performing QPP analysis for examining brain dynamics as this method has demonstrated clear neural correlates (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2014</xref>), reproducibility across individuals (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Yousefi et al., 2018</xref>) and across species (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Belloy et al., 2018a</xref>), and the potential to differentiate patient groups from controls (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Abbas et al., 2019b</xref>). Further, as PS and CAP analysis have now been shown to be sensitive to QPPs, it is possible that regression of one or more QPPs could benefit a PS or CAP analysis by uncovering additional features that might be obscured by the widespread spatial changes of the QPP (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Belloy et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Yousefi and Keilholz, 2021</xref>). Meanwhile, for studies explicitly seeking to identify dynamic changes occurring on slower time scales, the SWC method could be advantageous specifically because it is less sensitive to QPPs that could potentially confound the hypothesized differences. Indeed, there is evidence suggesting that SWC methods featuring window lengths ≥30s perform better than shorter windows or single timepoint methods at segmenting different cognitive tasks (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
        <p>Finally, there is recent evidence that the correlation between BOLD signal and underlying neural activity arises specifically from the type of peak amplitude events utilized for CAP analysis (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), potentially making CAPs the most sensitive method for studying neural brain dynamics. However, more research is certainly needed to elucidate the relationship between BOLD signal dynamics and neural activity.</p>

        <title>Further Considerations and Limitations</title>
        <p>One significant limitation of this study is that only k = 5 clusters/brain states were fully tested. Choosing an appropriate number of states for a particular study is important and can pose a challenge as there is not a well-established number of brain dynamics features and no perfect method for determining the optimal number to select. Some studies (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Damaraju et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez-Barragan et al., 2019</xref>) have employed the “elbow method” in which the ratios of within-cluster distances to between-cluster distances are plotted for a series of k cluster numbers (see <xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>) and a number k is selected which protrudes from the plot such that a greater contribution to optimizing the clustering is apparent for k than for k + 1. However, the number of clusters featuring optimized distances may not always be the optimal number for investigating brain dynamics and ideally studies will investigate a range of k clusters as shown here in the <xref rid="VS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Materials</xref> for a subset of the data (<italic>N</italic> = 20). For this study, the subset results do not indicate an optimal cluster number for any method using the elbow criterion but do appear consistent across a range of 3–10 clusters with each analysis method displaying common features and clustering QPP sequences in a consistent manner.</p>
        <p>An important methodological consideration for this type of analysis is the distance metric employed for k-means clustering. While the correlation distance was used for the present study, some have suggested that L1 distance may offer advantages for this type of analysis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2014</xref>). However, in performing this study the L1 distance was found to require greater computation time than the L2 or correlation distance metrics, and in limited testing the correlation distance appeared to offer the most qualitatively consistent results.</p>
