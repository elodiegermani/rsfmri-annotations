        <title>Significance</title>
        <p>Autobiographical memory includes the recollection of both episodic and semantic content, which has been shown to engage the default network. The present study examines how regions associated with the coordinated retrieval of different types of details are intrinsically connected to the default network and how these connectivity patterns in turn relate to autobiographical recall in younger and older adults. Connectivity within this circuit scaled with the tendency to recall one’s personal past with a balance of episodic and semantic detail. Young adults showed a distinct signature of connectivity related to more detailed recollection overall. Our findings provide a high-resolution map of connectivity within the default network and evidence for how variation in this map is sensitive to individual differences in autobiographical recollection.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Recollection of one’s personal past, or autobiographical memory (AM), varies across individuals and across the life span. This manifests in the amount of episodic content recalled during AM, which may reflect differences in associated functional brain networks. We take an individual differences approach to examine resting-state functional connectivity of temporal lobe regions known to coordinate AM content retrieval with the default network (anterior and posterior hippocampus, temporal pole) and test for associations with AM. Multiecho resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and autobiographical interviews were collected for 158 younger and 105 older healthy adults. Interviews were scored for internal (episodic) and external (semantic) details. Age group differences in connectivity profiles revealed that older adults had lower connectivity within anterior hippocampus, posterior hippocampus, and temporal pole but greater connectivity with regions across the default network compared with younger adults. This pattern was positively related to posterior hippocampal volumes in older adults, which were smaller than younger adult volumes. Connectivity associations with AM showed two significant patterns. The first dissociated connectivity related to internal vs. external AM across participants. Internal AM was related to anterior hippocampus and temporal pole connectivity with orbitofrontal cortex and connectivity within posterior hippocampus. External AM was related to temporal pole connectivity with regions across the lateral temporal cortex. In the second pattern, younger adults displayed temporal pole connectivity with regions throughout the default network associated with more detailed AMs overall. Our findings provide evidence for discrete ensembles of brain regions that scale with systematic variation in recollective styles across the healthy adult life span.</p>

  <body>
    <p content-type="flushleft">The recollection and retelling of personal past experiences vary across individuals and change over the life span (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Some people recall the rich spatiotemporal context of a prior experience, while others remember relatively few specific details. Similarly, some individuals recount experiences within a deeper semantic context, while others provide little background information. While not orthogonal, these ways of remembering reflect varying proclivities to access episodic and nonepisodic information during autobiographical recollection. Several factors may influence how individuals remember the past, including age. With advancing age, the episodic quality of memories diminishes as semantic features become more prominent, leaving recollections with increasing amounts of nonepisodic information (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
    <p>Neuropsychological studies have identified the hippocampus and temporal pole (TP) as necessary for episodic and semantic aspects of autobiographical memory (AM), respectively (e.g., refs. <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Task activation studies have found AM to involve a more distributed set of brain regions within the default network (DN) (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The hippocampus and TP may, therefore, coordinate the retrieval of different memory representations with regions of the DN for coherent autobiographical recall (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, little is known about how the hippocampus and TP specifically interact with the DN and whether these interactions relate to individual differences in AM recollective styles.</p>
    <p>The DN can be divided into a core set of regions and two subnetworks, each of which loosely maps onto the anterior temporal and posterior medial cortical systems that support different forms of memory-guided behavior (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, 3</xref>). The dorsal medial DN, corresponding to the anterior temporal system, is made up of regions functionally affiliated with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), including the TP (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This subnetwork is implicated in semantic-like tasks, such as abstract processing, mentalizing, and language comprehension (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The medial temporal DN, corresponding to the posterior medial system, comprises regions functionally affiliated with the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This subnetwork is associated with more episodic simulation abilities, such as AM, future thinking, scene construction, and situating items within a spatial context (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The precise functional architectures of the hippocampus and TP within and between these discrete network ensembles are not well characterized. It also remains to be determined whether variability within these ensembles scales with variability in AM across individuals.</p>
    <p>An age-related shift in the quality of AM recollection coincides with robust changes to the functional integrity of the DN. Specifically, connectivity within the DN is reduced in older adults and more integrated with other large-scale networks (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Compared with younger adults, older adults show reductions within core regions and the dorsal medial subnetwork but relative preservation of connectivity within the medial temporal subnetwork (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). An open question is whether the shift to semantic-laden AMs in older age is related to functional reorganization of the DN. Here, we determine whether individual differences and age effects in one’s tendency to recall more detailed AMs are related to the integrity of the functional ensembles that comprise the DN.</p>
    <p>Our approach was to examine how hippocampus and TP resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) with the DN covaries with individual differences in AM. RSFC reflects a combination of genetic and experience-dependent changes to functional interactions (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Individual differences in these functional dynamics may map onto individual differences in behavior, including the propensity to retrieve certain details when describing past experiences. Indeed, self-reported appraisal of recalling one’s personal past with more episodic detail has been associated with RSFC between the medial temporal lobes and posterior visual regions, a pattern similar to functional connectivity during visual episodic memory tasks (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Self-reported semantic-based remembering has been associated with medial temporal lobe RSFC to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Initial evidence from a small sample of older adults suggests that RSFC of the medial temporal lobe may relate to objective AM performance (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). A distinction between ensembles in a well-powered sample of younger and older adults has yet to be reported.</p>
    <p>We first characterized anterior hippocampus (AHIPP), posterior hippocampus (PHIPP), and TP RSFC with an extended DN (<xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows affiliations and abbreviations) in healthy younger and older adults. The hippocampus was segmented along its longitudinal axis to inspect whether anterior and posterior regions showed differential RSFC patterns with regions throughout the DN (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Second, we applied multivariate partial least squares (PLS) to test for age group differences in RSFC. We predicted that younger adults would show more differentiated DN subnetworks than older adults, reflected in stronger RSFC between the TP and the dorsal medial subnetwork and between the hippocampus and the medial temporal subnetwork. Finally, we used behavioral PLS to examine how these RSFC profiles related to individual differences in AM and whether these associations differed between younger and older adults. We predicted that episodic AM would associate with RSFC between regions of the hippocampus and the medial temporal subnetwork. Conversely, we predicted that semantic AM would relate to TP RSFC with the dorsal medial subnetwork. Evidence for this dissociation across all participants would fit into a broader framework of separable distributed network ensembles (or “process-specific assemblies”) (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), discernible at rest, configured to support different dimensions of AM (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We also hypothesized that RSFC associations with AM may differ by age group, reasoning that RSFC differences may underlie the age-related shift in episodic detail generation. The overarching goal was to link RSFC of temporal lobe structures integral for AM to variability in AM performance across individuals.</p>

      <p content-type="flushleft">In the largest sample of AM and RSFC reported to date, we examined hippocampus and TP RSFC with the DN and its relationship to AM (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We collected multiecho (ME) resting-state fMRI from a cohort of healthy younger and older adults and applied individualized cortical parcellations to test network and region-specific connectivity patterns. These innovations boost fMRI signal-to-noise ratios (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2203039119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>), reduce age confounds associated with spatial normalization to a standard template (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and account for individual variability in DN subnetworks (e.g., ref. <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We implemented a hippocampal segmentation protocol optimized for use in older adult brains to investigate the separable contributions of AHIPP and PHIPP to AM (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) while accounting for age-related variability in this region. Finally, the autobiographical interview (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) was administered as a gold standard measure of episodic (internal) and semantic (external) AM. Combined, these steps enhanced our power to detect how RSFC of AHIPP, PHIPP, and TP with the DN (<xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) associated with individual differences in AM. Our analysis proceeded in three steps: characterizing RSFC of the circuit, testing for age group differences, and identifying associations with internal and external AM as a function of age group. At each turn, regional effects are summarized by network effects, reflecting the most reliable within- and between-network connections (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, 4</xref> and <xref rid="s12" ref-type="sec"><italic toggle="yes">Materials and Methods</italic></xref>).</p>

        <p>Younger adults showed greater connectivity within TP, AHIPP, and PHIPP, reflected in connections across hemispheres within each region. Younger adults expressed stronger connectivity than older adults along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, showing both ipsilateral and contralateral connections between AHIPP and PHIPP. Intra-TP and TP connectivity with AHIPP and PHIPP were reliably greater in younger compared with older adults at the network level. At the regional level, younger adult TP connectivity was also greater with regions throughout DN-B and TEMP-PAR in both hemispheres, including lT, anterior inferior parietal lobule (aIPL), dmPFC, vPFC, and most regions of the TEMP-PAR cortex. In younger adults, select anterior medial TP parcels showed greater preferential connection to bilateral regions throughout DN-A and DN-C, including mPFC, dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC), parahippocampal cortex (PHC), and posterior inferior parietal lobule (pIPL). Greater bilateral AHIPP connections were also observed with these anterior medial TP parcels in younger adults. Greater AHIPP–DN-C network connections in younger adults were reflected in bilateral AHIPP connectivity to PHC and right pIPL. PHC, as part of DN-C, is more often associated with PHIPP as part of a posterior medial temporal lobe pathway (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Greater PHIPP connectivity to PHC was also observed but to a lesser extent. Greater PHIPP–OFC connections reliably contributed to the overall network pattern, although AHIPP–OFC connections were also observed with more medial and rostral OFC parcels.</p>
        <p>Older adults had a distinct pattern of greater between-network RSFC, which in part, reflected reduced anticorrelation (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2203039119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S5<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></ext-link>), compared with younger adults. The first of these was greater TP connectivity, marked by TP–DN-A and TP–DN-C at the network level. At the regional level, this result emerged as bilateral TP connectivity with precuneus (Prec)/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), right dPFC, and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). These regional connections were notably less negative and even positive in older adults (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2203039119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S5<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></ext-link>). The most reliable AHIPP RSFC differences in older compared with younger adults were with prefrontal DN-B regions, including dmPFC and lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC). Similar connections were observed with PHIPP. Greater AHIPP and PHIPP connectivity was also observed with left Prec/PCC. Overall, older adults showed greater hippocampal connectivity across regions within DN-A and DN-B, whereas younger adults had stronger hippocampal connections with DN-C regions. Hippocampus may, therefore, bind the posterior cortex to the DN in younger age (e.g., ref. <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) but not into older adulthood. Indeed, older adults showed a striking pattern of greater PHIPP–TEMP-PAR connectivity emerging from bilateral PHIPP connections to the right TEMP-PAR cortex.</p>
        <p>We next tested whether this pattern was influenced by gray matter volumes of the three regions of interest. As seen in <xref rid="fig03" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>, larger PHIPP volumes in the left hemisphere (and marginally in the right) were associated with higher brain connectivity scores in older adults only (left: p<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>(99) = 0.25, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05, [0.06, 0.42]; right: p<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>(99) = 0.18, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.06, [−0.01, 0.36]). Older adults with larger PHIPP volumes had a pattern of RSFC more similar to that expressed by younger adults. This relationship was statistically attenuated when site was included as a covariate (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2203039119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S3 and Tables S3 and S4</ext-link>).

        <title>RSFC Associations with AM.</title>
        <p>AM was tested with the Autobiographical Interview (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). As part of the interview, participants chose a single memory, specific in time and place, to describe in detail for a series of different time periods (e.g., childhood, teenage years, etc.). Descriptions were scored for episodic-like “internal” details (i.e., order of events, location, time information, sensory descriptions, emotions, thoughts) and semantic-like “external” details (i.e., general semantic information about oneself and the world, repetitions, metacognitive statements, specific details about unrelated memories). A full subcategory listing is detailed in <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2203039119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Table S5 and S6</ext-link>. The number of internal and external details is typically tallied and averaged across events. Work from our laboratory has shown that measures controlling for verbosity, which we refer to as internal and external density scores, are more reliable and valid metrics of AM (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p>
        <p>We have previously examined how internal and external density scores in this sample were associated with gray matter volumes of AHIPP, PHIPP, and TP (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We reported that older adults had less internally dense and more externally dense recollections than younger adults (internal density: M<sub>young</sub>: 0.09, SD<sub>young</sub>: 0.02, M<sub>old</sub>: 0.07, SD<sub>old</sub>: 0.02, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>(258) = 11.06, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 1.38; external density: M<sub>young</sub>: 0.02, SD<sub>young</sub>: 0.01, M<sub>old</sub>: 0.04, SD<sub>old</sub>: 0.01, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>(258) = 6.32, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.79).</p>
        <p>Here, we tested for RSFC patterns associated with internal and external density scores. To do so, we used behavior PLS to identify patterns of RSFC in younger and older adults that covaried with internal and external density scores. PLS was carried out in the same 2,091 pairwise connections between our three regions of interest—AHIPP, PHIPP, and TP—and regions of the extended DN. Two significant latent variables emerged.</p>

First, internal density was positively associated with greater TP–LIM-B, AHIPP–LIM-B, and bilateral PHIPP RSFC. At the regional level, left-lateralized TP connections were observed with regions throughout the extended DN. Right TP connections were observed with mPFC regions, including OFC, mPFC, and dmPFC, as well as TEMP-PAR cortex. Bilateral AHIPP connections to OFC were most reliable, although AHIPP connections across hemispheres and to right mPFC were also observed. Internal density was also associated with RSFC between right PHIPP and PHC.</p>

          <p>RSFC associations with density scores were highly similar when controlling for sex, education, estimated whole-brain volume (eWBV), and framewise displacement.

          <p>We next conducted a post hoc analysis to explore which subcategories of internal and external details most contributed to the RSFC–density associations within each age group.

RSFC associations with external density were driven by external place, perceptual, semantic, repetition, and other details in younger adults and external event, place, time, perceptual, and emotion/thought details in older adults. Sex, education, framewise displacement, and eWBV were included as covariates.

Regionally, left TP showed both ipsi- and contralateral connections to OFC, RSC, and PHC. Left AHIPP was connected to TEMP-PAR cortex both ipsi- and contralaterally, while right AHIPP connectivity to TEMP-PAR cortex remained ipsilateral. AM in younger adults was thus associated with left intra- and interhemispheric RSFC within an extended DN. Internal and external density scores in younger adults were negatively associated with TP connectivity to DN-B. Specifically, younger adult AM was associated with less connectivity between left-lateralized TP connectivity to aIPL, dmPFC, lPFC, and vPFC (<xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>, cooler colors). Notably, internal and external density scores in younger adults were also negatively associated with AHIPP and PHIPP connectivity to anterior midline regions, including OFC and mPFC, as well as with right PHIPP connectivity throughout the extended DN.

      <p content-type="flushleft">Our findings provide a high-resolution map of RSFC between temporal lobe structures and regions throughout the DN, as well as differences with age. They also provide evidence that RSFC of AHIPP, PHIPP, and TP with the DN is related to individual differences in autobiographical recollection. We first established the RSFC profiles of key regions involved in AM and tested for differences between younger and older adults. Across participants, TP was strongly connected to lateral temporal regions. AHIPP and PHIPP were strongly connected to regions of the medial temporal DN subnetwork, including OFC. Compared with older adults, younger adults had greater RSFC between both hippocampal regions and OFC. As predicted, older adults had lower RSFC within AHIPP, PHIPP, and TP but greater RSFC between AHIPP, PHIPP and TP with distributed regions of the DN. This pattern of higher and lower RSFC was associated with PHIPP volumes in older adults, suggestive of a link between local structural and distributed functional differences with age. When RSFC was related to individual differences in AM, a common pattern emerged across age groups. Internal density was associated with greater AHIPP and TP connectivity to OFC and intra-PHIPP connectivity. External density was associated with higher TP connectivity to regions across the lT and TEMP-PAR cortex. Younger adults also demonstrated a unique pattern of AM related to RSFC; the tendency to recall a higher density of autobiographical detail was associated with greater TP connectivity to OFC and RSC, greater AHIPP connectivity to TEMP-PAR cortex, and lower TP connectivity to PFC. Our findings reveal that individual differences in RSFC of key temporal lobe structures with the DN explain individual differences in AM recollective styles.</p>
      <sec id="s8">
        <title>Age Group Differences in RSFC of AHIPP, PHIPP, and TP.</title>
        <p>A multivariate comparison of RSFC between age groups revealed that older adults had less connectivity within TP, AHIPP, and PHIPP as well as less connectivity between AHIPP and PHIPP, largely consistent with prior work (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). This pattern recapitulates a pattern of large-scale network dedifferentiation across the healthy aging connectome (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Reduced connectivity within AHIPP and within PHIPP suggests a nonspecific reduction in functional connectivity across the hippocampal longitudinal axis in older adults.</p>
        <p>TP showed greater affiliation with lateral temporal regions in younger adults, corresponding to a dorsal medial DN subnetwork (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic toggle="yes">3</italic></xref>, coral colors). Younger adults also had greater TP RSFC with TEMP-PAR regions. The TEMP-PAR network, as defined by the Schaefer atlas (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), includes frontal and temporal parcels specialized for language processing (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that a purported language network may be distinct from but spatially adjacent to other default subnetworks (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The TP has been robustly implicated in language processing (e.g., ref. <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), and greater TP RSFC to TEMP-PAR cortex in younger adults may correspond to a more robust language network in both hemispheres.</p>
        <p>Our analysis also revealed heterogeneity in TP RSFC in younger adults. Select anterior medial portions of TP were connected to core DN regions and PHC. AHIPP connectivity to this same TP region was among the most reliable connections in younger adults, along with AHIPP connectivity to PHC. Indeed, anterior medial TP may be more cytoarchitectonically similar to medial TP, which is homologous to ventral TP in nonhuman primates (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Stronger RSFC of this TP region may be expected along the medial extent of the temporal lobe, such as with PHC, and may hence show similarities to PHC RSFC (<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Given its proximity and connection to AHIPP, this anterior medial TP region may be uniquely located to pivot between DN subnetworks. In older adults, TP was less functionally associated with dorsal medial DN regions, instead correlating more—and less selectively—with posterior core and medial temporal DN regions, connections that were notably negative in younger adults. This converges with prior evidence of dedifferentiation in the dorsal medial DN subnetwork (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and reduced anticorrelation of regions within the medial temporal lobe and posterior DN in older adults (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The more widespread connectivity between TP and posterior DN regions may also suggest decreased functional heterogeneity within the TP in older adulthood.</p>
        <p>AHIPP and PHIPP RSFC in younger adults revealed a tighter correspondence to the medial temporal DN subnetwork than older adults, as evidenced by greater RSFC to PHC, mPFC, and OFC (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic toggle="yes">3</italic></xref>, navy colors). This finding diverged from prior work identifying PHC as preferentially connected to PHIPP as part of a posterior medial network (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In older adults, greater hippocampal RSFC was most prominently observed between PHIPP and the TEMP-PAR cortex. In fact, older adults had greater RSFC for both AHIPP and PHIPP with distributed regions throughout the DN. This was in contrast to work finding lower RSFC between PHIPP and core regions of the DN alongside increased connectivity within PHIPP in older adults (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). These inconsistencies may be due to differences in analysis choices, including the extent of regions tested for RSFC differences, functional boundary mapping (e.g., hippocampal body as PHIPP instead of AHIPP) (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), smaller samples sizes, and poorer temporal signal-to-noise ratios. The present work overcomes many of these methodological challenges to characterize age differences in RSFC throughout the DN. The combination of techniques applied here—ME fMRI for improved signal detection (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2203039119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>), hippocampal segmentation with an atlas optimized for use in older adults, and individualized parcellation for individual-specific demarcation of functional regions—provides unprecedented precision in characterizing this network.</p>
        <p>RSFC differences across groups were related to PHIPP gray matter volume. We recently reported that older adults have smaller PHIPP gray matter volumes compared with younger adults, with no differences observed in AHIPP or TP (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Here, larger PHIPP volumes in older adults were related to stronger expression of the “young-like” RSFC pattern. This finding suggests a link between local structural and distributed functional differences in older compared with younger adults (<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). We speculate that the observed age differences in RSFC may be driven by gray matter atrophy to the PHIPP. Including site as a covariate attenuated this relationship, yet controlling for site removes desirable demographic variability that may have even more pronounced effects on older adult brain structure and function (e.g., ref. <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2203039119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic></ext-link>). Replication in larger, diverse samples will be necessary to advance our understanding of age differences in structure–function relationships within the temporal lobe, particularly where longitudinal data are lacking.</p>

        <title>An Age-Invariant Pattern of RSFC Dissociates Internal from External Autobiographical Recollection.</title>
        <p>Despite age differences in the functional architecture of the AM circuit under examination, individual differences in internal and external AM were dissociated in their patterns of RSFC across the full sample. This is consistent with task-related findings showing that younger and older adults engage similar regions during AM (<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref><xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), although older adults demonstrate more robust bilateral activation of medial and lateral temporal lobe regions (<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Task studies have also identified activity that differs between younger and older adults (<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). These differences are often attributed to the reduced episodic content of recollection in older age, although few studies have explicitly linked task activation to individual differences in AM. The advantage of the approach used here is that RSFC dissociated internal and external AM, providing evidence for separable distributed network ensembles that may be configured to support different aspects of AM (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Similar approaches have been used to identify such ensembles in association with self-reported AM abilities (e.g., ref. <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We extend these findings to objective AM performance and suggest that RSFC differences may offer insight into why individuals vary in how they recount the past.</p>
        <p>Individuals with more internally dense recollections had greater RSFC between AHIPP/TP and OFC and within PHIPP. AHIPP, TP, and OFC are anatomically and functionally connected as part of the dorsal medial DN. Together, these regions are predicted to play a role in familiarity-based recognition, social and emotional processing, and semantic knowledge representation (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Our results suggest that variation in RSFC among these regions may also scale with episodic processes. While self-reported episodic AM abilities in younger adults have been associated with RSFC between the hippocampus and posterior medial regions (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), a more distributed set of regions active during AM has been related to subjective ratings of imagined detail in younger and older adults (<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). We expand on this with evidence for how the magnitude of connectivity among AHIPP, PHIPP, and TP relates specifically to a performance-based measure of episodic AM.</p>
        <p>RSFC between AHIPP/TP and OFC systematically increases through adolescence concurrent with the development of complex cognitive functions (<xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). RSFC between these regions in association with internal AM may reflect fluid aspects of everyday remembering. AHIPP is thought to support recollection of coarse or more generalized AM information, as would be expected in early stages of memory construction prompted by open-ended retrieval cues (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Effective connectivity models have demonstrated interactions between AHIPP and frontotemporal regions during early AM retrieval that precede PHIPP interactions with posteriomedial regions during later elaboration (<xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Activity in ventromedial PFC, which spans OFC, is associated with temporarily binding schema representations from across the cortex to form higher-order knowledge templates (<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). When certain schemas are activated, ventromedial PFC can then bias information processing in a context-sensitive manner. Studies leveraging the higher temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography during AM have shown that ventromedial PFC activity during construction drives hippocampal activity that is then sustained throughout elaboration (<xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). TP is often associated with semantic processes and incorporating prior knowledge into encoded representations (e.g., refs. <xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> and <xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Functional interactions among AHIPP, TP, and OFC could putatively reflect context-dependent retrieval that takes place in OFC; representations of associated episodes in AHIPP arrive at OFC and activate specific schemas that then call on relevant prior knowledge from TP, all to engage and retrieve context-appropriate representations from PHIPP. The observed pattern of greater RSFC for more internally dense AMs may, therefore, reflect connections forged as a result of repeated efficient context-dependent retrieval. This pattern of RSFC may be weaker with a reduced capacity for context-dependent retrieval and internal episodic AM.</p>
        <p>The predominance of left TP connections associated with internal AM suggests a link to language. Although TP has been associated with the dorsal medial DN subnetwork (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), which plays a role in semantic processing (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), it has also shown strong affiliation to a left-lateralized language network (e.g., ref. <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Language is inextricably linked to autobiographical recollection, which may explain why episodic AM more often engages regions in the left hemisphere (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The extent to which semantic processes that support memory overlap with semantic processes that involve language—and the role TP may play in each—remains to be determined. Left TP RSFC related to higher internal density was observed with TEMP-PAR regions belonging to the language network but more so with regions throughout the DN. TP may be particularly well suited to flexibly couple between regions that support both language and memory processes.</p>
        <p>Our findings relate TP RSFC with lateral temporal and prefrontal regions to a greater propensity for external AM across individuals. A stronger association in older adults further suggests a shift toward relying more on external information when recalling personal memories in older age. lT, lPFC, and TEMP-PAR cortex are all predicted to communicate bidirectionally with anterior temporal regions, including the TP, during semantic cognition (<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). The observed interregional connections related to external AM underscore that variation in RSFC across these specific regions is sensitive to variation in external AM. Although we did not have predictions about the laterality of effects, external AM was exclusively associated with contralateral TP connectivity. When examining the subcategory contributions to this RSFC pattern, we found that external semantic details contributed most to the association in younger adults, while external event, place, time, perceptual, and emotion/thought details contributed most in older adults (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2203039119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Tables S5 and S6</ext-link>). In other words, younger adults showed separable RSFC associations between episodic and semantic details, whereas older adults showed separable RSFC associations between relevant and irrelevant episodic information. It is possible that RSFC related to semantic information in older adults is less distinguishable from that of relevant episodic information if, with age, episodic detail is “semanticized,” whereby specific memories gradually lose their spatiotemporal context over time (<xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). The distinction between relevant and irrelevant episodic details in older adults is especially intriguing given age-related impairments to attention, stemming from a reduced ability to suppress irrelevant information (e.g., ref. <xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). AM studies tend to center on the internal, episodic quality of recalling the past, yet better characterization of the external aspects of AM, especially in older age, can provide much needed insight into the neurocognitive contributions of shifts in narrative storytelling (<xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>).</p>

        <title>An RSFC Pattern Associated with Autobiographical Recollection in Younger Adults.</title>
        <p>Younger adults displayed a unique pattern of RSFC associated with AM. In this pattern, internal and external density covaried together, revealing a network ensemble specific to younger adult recollection. More detail-dense recollections were associated with greater RSFC between the left TP (including the anteromedial TP) and OFC, Prec/PCC, RSC, and PHC. Less dense recollections were related to greater left TP RSFC with PFC and TEMP-PAR cortex. TP RSFC patterns may associate with greater overall AM detail since TP binds high-level social and emotional information (<xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Subcategory contributions to this pattern included internal and external event details (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2203039119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Tables S5 and S6</ext-link>). Unlike in older adults, relevant and irrelevant episodic details were similarly related to RSFC in younger adults. Leading models of AM posit that access to our repository of memories is hierarchical; specific episodic experiences are embedded within categories of more general events, which are, in turn, subsumed under lifetime periods (<xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Retrieval and reconstruction of an appropriate memory involve sifting through broader organizing categories to gain access to specific contextual details. Additional interactions, such as those between AHIPP and OFC, may be needed early on to adjudicate the relevance of episodic detail. The absence of this shared pattern of covariance in older adults may suggest altered mechanisms of context-dependent retrieval.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p content-type="flushleft">The present study is the largest aging investigation into the neural correlates of AM conducted with the Autobiographical Interview. Leveraging multivariate methods, we were able to move beyond inferences made from silent in-scanner AM tasks to separately examine individual differences in internal and external AM. We acknowledge that the brain–behavior associations presented convey an indirect characterization of age differences in brain function supporting AM (refs. <xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> and <xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> have similar commentary). Task activation studies are an effective means for identifying brain activity engaged during cognition but offer limited information about how activity varies across people. Using RSFC, here we identified specific network ensembles that systematically vary across individuals in predicting internal and external aspects of AM. Interactions within and between these ensembles are key to understanding individual differences in recollection. These findings largely converge with recent work characterizing separable and combined roles of anterior temporal and posterior medial regions in AM and cognition more broadly (e.g., refs. <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, and <xref rid="r70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>) and provide testable hypotheses for future task fMRI studies (<xref rid="r71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Continued advances in neuroimaging methods, such as real-time motion correction for audible in-scanner AM tasks (<xref rid="r72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>), will be instrumental to further understand the different processes that underlie individual differences in AM.</p>

We recently reported on this subset of participants to examine the link between AM and structural MRI (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). This subset comprised participants from a larger sample of participants with AM data (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) who also underwent MRI scanning. Briefly, all participants were screened for histories of neurological or psychiatric disorder, depressive symptomology (assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory or the Geriatric Depression Scale) (<xref rid="r73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="r74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), and mild cognitive impairment (using the Mini-Mental State Examination) (<xref rid="r75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>).

        <title>AM.</title>
        <p>AM was assessed with the Autobiographical Interview (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Participants were asked to choose a memory from each of three (younger adults) or five (older adults) life stages: childhood, teenage years, early adulthood, middle adulthood, and older adulthood. Participants were instructed to only choose memories that were specific in time and place. Starting with the first memory, participants described the memory chosen in as much detail as possible until they reached a natural end (free recall). Participants were then asked if they remembered anything else about the memory (general probe) before moving onto the next life stage. After all memory descriptions, each memory was revisited, and participants were probed with specific questions to cue episodic recollection (specific probe). Participants then rated the memory for vividness, emotional change, significance, and rehearsal of the memory on a five-point Likert scale. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed.</p>
        <p>Interviews were scored according to the original protocol by trained researchers. According to this procedure, scorers identify the main event in each memory and subdivide the text into internal details—episodic details related to the event—and external details—primarily semantic details that often provide background. Internal details include information about the sequence of events, location, time, perceptual landscape, and the participant’s emotions and thoughts. External details include semantic information, repetitions, metacognitive statements, and other details unrelated to the main event. A full listing of subcategories can be found in <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2203039119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Tables S5 and S6</ext-link>. Tallies are then made for each detail type and for the broader internal and external categories. Text from the specific probe was not considered in the present study. All interviews were double scored and reached high interrater reliability (internal: <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>(261) = 0.91, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; external: <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>(261) = 0.82, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
        <p>Work from our laboratory has shown that internal and external detail counts, which may serve as coarse approximations for episodic and semantic recollection, are positively associated with each other and overall word count (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Dependent variables that control for verbosity have high reliability across memories, remove the positive association between internal and external details, and demonstrate convergent validity with other laboratory performance-based memory tasks. Here, we use one such variable, a density score, which separately divides internal and external counts by a memory’s overall word count. Internal and external density scores were averaged across memories to serve as stable measures of episodic and semantic recollection. Density scores for subcategories of internal and external details were also calculated.</p>

          <p>The functional data preprocessing and analysis here have been previously applied to a larger sample and detailed elsewhere (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). We review them in brief below. A schematic of methodological steps is shown in <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.</p>
          <p>T1-weighted images were skull stripped in FSL with the Brain Extraction Tool(<xref rid="r85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>) using default parameters. Skull-stripped anatomical and functional images were then submitted to ME Independent Components Analysis (<xref rid="r86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, <xref rid="r87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>) for minimal preprocessing and denoising. Advantages of ME acquisitions include the ability to better approximate T2*, the transverse relaxation in gradient echo imaging, in every voxel, derive a T2* map of the brain, and optimally combine echoes. The TE-dependence model of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal drives denoising by separating TE-dependent BOLD signal from TE-independent noise. Together, these provide a significant boost to BOLD signal detection, particularly in regions prone to signal dropout, such as TP and OFC (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">Inset</italic>). Denoised time series were quality checked to flag participants with unsuccessful coregistration, residual noise (framewise displacement of &gt; 0.50 and denoised time series with DVARS &gt; 1, where DVARS refers to BOLD signal rate of change between TRs) (<xref rid="r88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>), poor temporal signal-to-noise ratio (&lt; 50), or fewer than 10 retained BOLD-like components. Inspection of residual motion effects is detailed in <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2203039119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic></ext-link>. The denoised BOLD component coefficient sets in native space were then mapped to a common cortical surface (fsaverage5) in FreeSurfer and concatenated.</p>
          <p>To examine age-related changes to functional brain network organization, we implemented a participant-specific functional parcellation approach with group prior individual parcellation (GPIP) (<xref rid="r89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). This approach initializes with a predefined group atlas (Schaefer 400) (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and then, refines participants’ parcel boundaries by drawing on their resting-state fMRI data. GPIP has been shown to improve the homogeneity of BOLD signal within parcels, better demarcate functional regions (<xref rid="r89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>), and enhance the detection of brain–behavior associations (<xref rid="r90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="r91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). The output of GPIP was a final optimal cortical parcellation for each participant from which BOLD coefficient sets were extracted.</p>

        <p>To assess RSFC, we conducted a variation on seed–voxel connectivity between our three regions of interest—AHIPP, PHIPP, and TP—and an extended DN: LIM (LIM-A, LIM-B), default (DN-A, DN-B, DN-C), and TEMP-PAR subnetworks from the Yeo 17-network solution (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). LIM-A and LIM-B were included for TP and OFC parcels (ref. <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> has alternate subnetwork assignments). <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows a surface rendering and legend of subnetworks. <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> includes a full description of regions belonging to each subnetwork.</p>
        <p>BOLD data were extracted from each participant’s GPIP solution from only the parcels comprising these six subnetworks (119 parcels in total). Extracted BOLD data from AHIPP and PHIPP were added at this step. Functional connectivity matrices were then created by computing the product–moment (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>) correlation coefficient between each pair of regions. A canonical Fisher’s <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> to <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> transformation was applied (as in ref. <xref rid="r87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>) to simultaneously normalize the correlation values and account for varying degrees of freedom (i.e., the number of BOLD coefficients) across participants. The matrix of <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> values was then downsized to a rectangular 17 × 123 matrix to specifically examine how the BOLD signal in TP, AHIPP, and PHIPP covaried with LIM, DN, and TEMP-PAR subnetworks.</p>

          <title>RSFC of AHIPP, PHIPP, and TP with the DN.</title>
          <p>Average RSFC was first calculated within each age group (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>). Bootstrap resampling (resampling rate = 10,000) was used to calculate the 95% CI around each pairwise <italic toggle="yes">z</italic>-value connection and determine reliability. Connections with CIs crossing zero were masked out.</p>
          <p>We performed a separate analysis to visualize the overall RSFC pattern of each region of interest with the extended DN across all participants (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>). For each region of interest, BOLD data were averaged across parcels from both hemispheres, and RSFC matrices were recomputed, rendering three 1 × 109 matrices for each participant. The <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> values were averaged across all participants, and significance was determined with a one-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test. <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values below 0.05 were masked out. AHIPP and PHIPP are not shown on the surface. For visualization purposes, all TP parcels in TP RSFC were assigned the maximum value in the matrix to indicate autocorrelation.</p>

          <title>Age group differences in RSFC and relationships to AM.</title>
          <p>PLS was used to examine group differences in RSFC, and behavior PLS was used to examine RSFC associations with density scores from the Autobiographical Interview. PLS is a multivariate method that identifies patterns of maximal covariance between two sets of variables (<xref rid="r96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>, <xref rid="r97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). Here, those variables were represented by participant RSFC matrices and either 1) age group or 2) density scores.</p>
          <p>To run PLS, a data matrix <bold>X</bold> was created with all participants’ rectangular connectivity matrices. Each row of <bold>X</bold> corresponded to a vector containing one participant’s within-network (LIM-A–LIM-A, AHIPP–AHIPP, PHIPP–PHIPP) and between-network connections. Column-wise means are then calculated by age group. All data in <bold>X</bold> were then mean centered and submitted to singular value decomposition to yield mutually orthogonal latent variables representing distinct relationships between the two variables mentioned above. Each latent variable consisted of 1) a left singular vector containing the weighted connectivity pattern optimally expressing the covariance, 2) a right singular vector with the weights of the study design variables (i.e., age group or density scores), and 3) a scalar singular value with the covariance strength between the design variable and connectivity. For each pattern, a brain connectivity score can be calculated from the dot product of the left singular vector (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and each participant’s functional connectivity matrix. Stronger positive values reflect expression of the warmer colors, while stronger negative values reflect expression of the cooler colors. Brain connectivity scores, therefore, represent the degree to which each participant expressed the pattern identified.</p>
          <p>Permutation testing was used to statistically evaluate patterns identified, and bootstrap resampling determined the reliability of pairwise connections (1,000 permutations, 500 bootstraps). Connectivity weights were considered to significantly contribute to the overall pattern when bootstrap ratios (weight in the singular vector/bootstrap-estimated SE) exceeded ±1.96, corresponding to the 95% CI.</p>
          <p>For display purposes, PLS results for each region of interest were mapped to the surface by averaging unthresholded results across parcels in the left and right hemispheres and then, thresholding to a bootstrap ratio of 1.96. AHIPP and PHIPP regions are not shown on the surface.</p>
          <p>Partial correlations between brain connectivity scores and each region of interest volume (each hemisphere separately) were carried out to explore associations between volume and age group differences in RSFC. Covariates included sex, education, eWBV, and framewise displacement. Associations were considered significant at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05. Site was not included as a covariate since participants across sites added desirable variability due to increased demographic diversity in the Toronto cohort (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2203039119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic></ext-link>). Instead, we ensured that any age group effects existed over and above site effects by conducting analyses of covariance on brain connectivity scores with site, sex, education, eWBV, and mean framewise displacement as covariates [<italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(1,256) = 78.60, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.23]. Correlations with site included as a covariate are also reported for completeness. We also report partial correlations between brain connectivity scores from behavior PLS and density scores with sex, education, eWBV, framewise displacement, and site as covariates with the corresponding results.</p>
          <p>A final set of post hoc correlations was conducted between brain connectivity scores from behavior PLS and more granular detail categories. The goal was to explore which specific detail types contributed to associations between RSFC and internal/external density (i.e., internal: event, place, time, perceptual, emotion/thought details; external: semantic, repetition, other, event, place, time, perceptual, emotion/thought). Partial correlations were run between brain connectivity scores and detail density from all detail categories with sex, education, eWBV, and framewise displacement as covariates. Results with site as an additional covariate are also provided. Associations were considered significant at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

          <title>Network contributions.</title>
          <p>PLS identifies interregional connectivity patterns that differ by group and/or covary with density scores. To examine network-level effects for each analysis, we calculated network contributions to each PLS-derived functional connectivity pattern (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). Positive and negative weighted adjacency matrices were constructed from the PLS pattern; nodes represented parcels defined by either the individual parcellation or a unilateral segment of the hippocampus (i.e., left AHIPP), while edges represented the thresholded bootstrap ratio of each pairwise connection. Network-level contributions were then quantified by 1) assigning each parcel according to the network assignment reported by Yeo et al. (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) or to a hippocampal “network” (left and right AHIPP, left and right PHIPP), 2) taking the average of all connection weights in a given network and calculating within- and between-network connectivity to yield a 3 × 8 matrix (LIM-A, AHIPP, PHIPP × LIM-A, LIM-B, DN-A, DN-B, DN-C, TEMP-PAR, AHIPP, PHIPP), and 3) permutation testing for significance. For each of 10,000 permutations, network labels were shuffled, and mean within- and between-network connectivity estimates were recalculated. After 10,000 iterations, an empirical null sampling distribution was created. Within- and between-network connections were deemed significant when the proportion of times the value of the sampling distribution was greater than or equal to the empirical value did not exceed 0.05 (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows an example).</p>
