Group effects were assessed via either an HIV \u00d7 CB ANOVA or, for categorical variables, via chi-square tests (one comparing HIV+ vs. HIV\u2212 groups and one comparing CB+ vs. CB\u2212 groups). AA: African American, C: Caucasian, A: Asian, >1: more than one race. \u2628Independent sample t test between CB+ groups. \u03b4All group effects in section assessed with independent sample t test between HIV+ groups, or for categorical variables, a chi-square test. \u03beEstimator of general cognitive impairment: t score < 40 for both: total recall on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test\u2013Revised (HVLT-R; Benedict et al., 1998; Brandt, 1991) and symbol search scores on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013Fourth edition (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, 2008), or t score < 35 for either test (Carey et al., 2004).", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_000.csv"}
