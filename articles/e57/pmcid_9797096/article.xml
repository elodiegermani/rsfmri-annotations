        <p>The amygdala is a brain region with a complex internal structure that is associated with psychiatric disease. Methodological limitations have complicated the study of the internal structure of the amygdala in humans. In the current study we examined the functional connectivity between nine amygdaloid nuclei and existing resting-state networks using a high spatial-resolution fMRI dataset. Using data-driven analysis techniques we found that there were three main clusters inside the amygdala that correlated with the somatomotor, ventral attention and default mode networks. In addition, we found that each resting-state networks depended on a specific configuration of amygdaloid nuclei. Finally, we found that co-activity in the cortical-nucleus increased with the severity of self-rated fear in participants. These results highlight the complex nature of amygdaloid connectivity that is not confined to traditional large-scale divisions, implicates specific configurations of nuclei with certain resting-state networks and highlights the potential clinical relevance of the cortical-nucleus in future studies of the human amygdala.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The amygdala is a brain structure located in anterior sections of the medial temporal lobe. Interest in this region stems from its association with a number of common psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The amygdala consists of a number of interconnected nuclei, each of which is thought to contribute to different aspects of emotion and cognition [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For example, animal studies have suggested that the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (La) plays a key role in fear learning, while the central nucleus (Ce) is involved in fear responses [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, methodological limitations in the spatial resolution of current neuroimaging techniques have hampered the study of the amygdaloid nuclei in humans [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Testing the generalizability of animal findings would improve our understanding of amygdala function and aid in the translation to clinical applications [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here we focused on the functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdaloid nuclei using the very high spatial-resolution 7T resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rsfMRI) dataset from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our focus was on discovering how the amygdaloid nuclei were connected to known resting-state networks. We also examined how the FC of the individual nuclei was associated with participants’ ratings of self-reported fear.</p>
      <p>There are thirteen different amygdaloid nuclei (see <xref rid="pone.0278962.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0278962.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> for an overview of the nuclei examined here). Previous tract-tracing studies in non-human animals have elucidated the anatomical connectivity of the amygdala [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The classical view is that primary sensory areas project mainly to the La nucleus, whereas the Ce nucleus projects to striatal and motor output regions [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, it is known that other brain regions have more complex anatomical connections with the nuclei of the amygdala. For example, the prefrontal cortex, an area thought to play an important role in modulating activity in the amygdala, is known to project to basal (Ba), La, accessory basal (AB), Ce and medial (Me) nuclei [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similarly, both the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus are known to project to all amygdala nuclei [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In humans, investigation of the FC of the amygdala has relied on low spatial-resolution fMRI acquisition protocols (around 2–4 mm) which do not permit the study of the individual amygdaloid nuclei. Instead, human FC studies have attempted to establish the connectivity between the amygdala and the rest of the brain based on large-scale sections of the amygdala that aggregate across individual nuclei. The most frequently used amygdala parcellation is based on its cytoarchitectonic properties and proposes that there are three large-scale sections called LateroBasal (LB), CentroMedial (CM) and SuperFicial (SF; [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], see <xref rid="pone.0278962.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for an overview).</p>

      <p>Previous studies have attempted to link the whole amygdala as well as its three large-scale sections with whole-brain resting-state networks such as those of [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, these studies have not produced clear results. Specifically, whereas studies have found FC between the amygdala and regions of the default mode, somatomotor, and (dorsal/ventral) attention networks [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], these networks were not consistently detected across all studies. Thus, for example, while regions of the default mode network co-activated with the amygdala in some studies [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], other studies did not find amygdala co-activity with the regions of the default mode network [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, how the large-scale divisions of the amygdala co-activated with these networks remains unclear. For example, whereas some studies have found that the LB region was associated with the default mode network [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], others have concluded that the SF region co-activated with this network [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and yet others have suggested the CM region is linked with the default mode network [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, overall, these previous studies have not examined FC of the amygdala nuclei due to their reliance on large-scale parcellations of the amygdala.</p>
      <p>Here we examined the FC of the different amygdaloid nuclei with the rest of the brain using the resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) dataset from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) with 1.6 mm isotropic resolution. We used a data-driven analysis approach to examine how different amygdaloid nuclei contributed to various reference resting-state networks [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, we tested whether the self-reported fear of the participants was associated with co-activity in the amygdaloid nuclei. Finally, we relied on a test-validation approach in which results obtained in the test dataset were validated in a separate dataset.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>All data were publicly available from the HCP website. Within this large dataset with over 1100 participants, there were 184 participants that had rsfMRI data with 1.6 mm spatial resolution that was collected at 7T. From this initial set we excluded participants that did not meet HCP specified Quality Control (QC) issues. Specifically, we removed 12 participants that did not meet QC issue A (anatomical anomalies), B (segmentation/surface errors), C (head coil instabilities), and D (significant resting-state artefacts) leading to a total dataset of 172 participants. Within this final dataset, 68 participants were male, and the most common age-range was 26–30 years (81 participants). The study was approved by the Research Ethics and Animal Welfare Committee (CEIBA) at the University of La Laguna (CEIBA2017–0270). Data were fully anonymized before they were accessed and therefore no consent was obtained.</p>

        <title>MRI data acquisition</title>
        <p>As per the HCP reference manual, the 7T data was collected on a Siemens Magnetom scanner located at the Center for Magnetic Resonance (CMRR) at University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, MN. The scanner uses the Nova32 32-channel Siemens receive head coil with an incorporated head-only transmit coil that surrounds the receive head coil from Nova Medical. Volumes were acquired using Gradient-Echo EPI. Each volume contained 85 slices that were acquired with a multiband factor of 5. Slice thickness was 1.6 mm with no gap, the FOV was 208 x 208 mm, matrix size 130 x 130, resulting in 1.6 mm isotropic voxels. The in-plane acceleration parameter (iPAT) was 2. The TR was 1000 ms, echo time (TE) 22.2 ms, and the flip angle 45°. In each run 900 volumes were collected and lasted around 16 minutes. Runs alternated between phase encoding in the posterior-anterior (PA) and anterior-posterior (AP) direction. Matched phase reversed spin-echo fieldmaps were collected and used for distortion correction. There were four rsfMRI sessions available for each participant. For our test-validation design, we used data from the first two sessions with alternating phase encoding directions as a test dataset, and the remaining two sessions as a validation dataset.</p>
        <p>In addition, structural T1w and T2w images were available for each participant. Again as per the HCP reference manual, these images were acquired on a customized Siemens Connectom Skyra 3T scanner. The T1w images were acquired using a 3DMPRAGE protocol TI/TR/TE: 1000/2400/2.14 ms, flip angle = 8°, resulting in 0.7 mm isotropic voxels. The T2w images were acquired using a 3D T2-SPACE protocol TR/TE: 3200/565 ms, flip angle = variable, and also resulting in 0.7 mm isotropic voxels.</p>

        <title>Preprocessing</title>
        <p>We downloaded the rsfMRI 1.6mm/32k FIX-Denoised (Compact) and rsfMRI FIX-Denoised (Extended) datasets for each participant. These datasets consist of already pre-processed functional data according to HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines ([<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], see also <xref rid="pone.0278962.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Briefly, transformations that reduce head motion are estimated using FSL MCFlirt, fieldmap (matched phase reversed spin-echo) and gradient distortion corrections are applied, and transformations from fMRI space to MNI space are estimated using non-linear transformations. Importantly, any imposed spatial smoothing of the data was minimized in two ways: First, the transformation from native to MNI space preserved the native space resolution of the fMRI acquisitions, and second, all transformations were postponed, combined and applied in a single step using spline interpolation (see [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] for further discussion of this issue).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Next, the data in MNI space was temporally filtered using a 2000 s highpass filter and automatically denoised using the FIX program [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This program uses semi-automatic classification of head-motion and other artifacts which minimized the potential impact of head-motion artefacts in our data. The final files were demeaned and had native 1.6mm isotropic resolution in MNI space. In addition, we extracted cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and white-matter masks from each participant’s freesurfer parcelation (in the wmparc file), obtained their timeseries by averaging across all voxels inside each mask, and then regressed this timeseries out of each participant’s fMRI data. The residual timeseries were then used as the final cleaned data on which further downstream analyses were performed.</p>
        <p>For the structural data, we downloaded the 3T Structural Preprocessed and 3T Structural Preprocessed Extended packages. These packages contained the T1w and T2w images for each participant as well as the full Freesurfer output and transformation matrices that were relevant for our downstream analyses (see below). For specific information on the pre-processing of these structural images we refer to [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

        <title>Analyses</title>
        <p>The main aim of the study was to explore the relative contributions of the amygdala nuclei to various resting-state networks. To obtain this objective the analyses were divided into six main parts.</p>
        <sec id="sec007">
          <title>Segmentation of amygdaloid nuclei</title>
          <p>First, for each participant we had available the full output produced by Freesurfer v5.3 [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Automatic segmentation of the amygdaloid nuclei was performed on this output by using the Hippocampal Subfields and Nuclei of the Amygdala script (v21) with the 0.7mm T2w image as the input [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This script produces an automatic segmentation of the nine different nuclei of the amygdala (see <xref rid="pone.0278962.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> for a visual presentation). The nine different nuclei were the anterior amygdaloid area (AAA), cortico-amygdaloid transition area (CAT), basal nucleus (Ba), lateral nucleus (La), accessory basal nucleus (AB), central nucleus (Ce), cortical nucleus (Co), medial nucleus (Me), and paralaminar nuclus (PL; See <xref rid="pone.0278962.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for an overview and <xref rid="pone.0278962.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> for a graphical presentation of the nuclei). These subdivisions do not take into account the concept of the extended amygdala, meaning that it excludes a basal forebrain structure called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The method proposed by [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] finds a segmentation for the amygdaloid nuclei in a given participant by combining prior information about the average structural location of the amygdaloid nuclei and its surrounding tissue with specific structural information (i.e., the relative position of structures and T1w signal intensity values) from a given participant’s brain [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This method fundamentally improves over the more common method in which the segmentation of the amygdala takes place in a standardized (MNI) space (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). This method therefore allows for a probabilistic segmentation of nine amygdala nuclei that is sensitive to the unique morphology of an individual’s brain.</p>

        <sec id="sec008">
          <title>Detection of signal clusters in the amygdala</title>
          <p>The second step of the analyses relied on the detection of clusters inside the amygdala using spatially-restricted Independent Component Analysis (srICA). srICA is an emerging technique in which the ICA technique is applied to a restricted region of the central nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that srICA leads to a more sensitive detection of signals inside the restricted brain region compared to whole-brain ICA [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the current study we applied group ICA using melodic v3.15 [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] with default options (except MIGP off) to the concatenation of 344 fMRI datasets (172 participants * 2 resting-state datasets) that were masked with a bilateral amygdala mask. As in other studies from our group [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], classification of detected Independent Components (ICs; referred to here as ‘seed clusters’ or ICs) inside the amygdala as signal or noise proceeded in three steps. First, group level whole-brain FC maps that were correlated with each detected seed cluster were computed using Dual Regression and FSL randomise [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Second, each group level whole-brain FC map linked to a specific amygdala seed was correlated with each of the 7 reference resting-state networks of [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Third, this procedure was optimized across a wide range of ICA dimensions such that it found the dimension at which the correlations between the obtained whole-brain FC maps and the reference networks was highest. This procedure therefore detected in a data-driven fashion the dimension for which the srICA produced voxel clusters inside the amygdala that were maximally associated with known resting-state networks (please see <xref rid="pone.0278962.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> or [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] for further information).</p>

          <title>Group-level analyses of whole-brain FC</title>
          <p>The next step served to obtain lists of brain regions involved in each whole-brain resting-state network. We relied on a parcel level approach in which we extracted the average Z-value for each brain region listed in the Desikan-Killany atlas from each participant-specific whole-brain FC map. These data were then subjected to a regression model of the form:

Participant-specific amygdaloid subnuclei masks were intersected with each participant-specific whole-brain FC map.

          <p>All statistical modeling took place in the statistical computing environment R (v4.0.0). Mixed effect modeling relied on the lme4 package (v1.1.23) [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

        <p>The procedure for finding the optimal number of dimensions first returned that across the tested ICA dimensions 1 to 15, obtained group level FC maps correlated strongly (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> &gt; 0.4) with the somatomotor, ventral attention, and default mode networks. Furthermore, our optimization method found that the smallest dimension at which these 3 networks were strongly and uniquely detected was for ICA with dimension = 7. Specifically, we found that for this specific ICA dimension, IC2 correlated strongly and uniquely with the ventral attention network (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.48), IC3 with somatomotor network (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = .45), and IC5 with the default mode network (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.59; see <xref rid="pone.0278962.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> for an overview of the correlations for each IC with all 7 networks). In addition, as can be seen in <xref rid="pone.0278962.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>, strong correlations (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> &gt; 0.4) were frequently found for these three networks in other dimensions, suggesting that the detection of these three networks was not idiosyncratic to dimension 7. Similarly, as can be seen in <xref rid="pone.0278962.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>, ICA at dimensions 20 and 30 did not lead to the detection of new networks. We can therefore conclude that the specific clusters of voxels detected by the ICA using dimension 7 for IC2, IC3, and IC5 were optimal in connecting with three known resting-state networks.</p>

        <p>A visual presentation of the location of the three seed clusters detected inside the amygdala along with their associated whole-brain group-level FC map is presented in <xref rid="pone.0278962.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>. A further overview of all 7 seed clusters with their corresponding FC maps is shown in <xref rid="pone.0278962.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>. As can be seen in <xref rid="pone.0278962.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, the three seed clusters are located at different positions in the amygdala and revealed contrasting FC with the rest of the brain, indicating the involvement in different whole-brain networks. A more detailed view of the location of each seed cluster within the amygdala can be seen in <xref rid="pone.0278962.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A–4C</xref>, where it can be seen that the three clusters detected by spatially restricted ICA occupy positions within the amygdala that likely reflect activity across multiple nuclei. How these activation clusters are connected with the rest of the brain as well as how they are distributed across the various amygdaloid nuclei will be examined in more detail below.</p>

        <title>Group-level analyses of whole-brain FC</title>
        <p>Group-level analyses revealed the specific lists of regions co-activated in each FC map (see <xref rid="pone.0278962.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> for the average Z values for each region by FC map). Specifically, multiple regression analyses revealed a main effect of Hemisphere (F(1,44588)=6.35, p &lt; 0.02), suggesting higher co-activity values in the left versus the right hemisphere. In addition, there was a main effect of Brain Region (F(43,44588)=64.45, p &lt; 0.0001) suggesting that co-activity values differed between the different cortical and subcortical brain regions. Furthermore, there was a main effect of FC map (F(2,44588)=1550.54, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting co-activity values differed between the different FC maps. Important for our present purposes, there was a significant interaction between Brain Region and FC map (F(86,44588)=147.05, p &lt; 0.0001) suggesting that average co-activity values for each brain region differed between the different FC maps. Further exploring this interaction with posthoc tests revealed the list of regions where one FC map was significantly more co-activated compared to the other two maps. As can be seen in <xref rid="pone.0278962.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, FC map corresponding to IC2 revealed regions typically associated with the vental attention network like supramarginal gyrus, insular and anterior cingulate cortices. In addition, <xref rid="pone.0278962.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> showed that FC map corresponding to IC3 had high co-activity values in areas typically associated with the somatomotor network like sensorimotor cortex (post and paracentral gyrus). Finally, <xref rid="pone.0278962.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> revealed that FC map corresponding to IC5 had strong co-activity values in regions typically associated with the default mode network like the retrosplenial cortex (isthmus cingulate), precuneus, and medial orbitofrontal gyrus.</p>

        <title>Relative contributions of amygdaloid nuclei</title>
        <p>Statistical analyses of the relative contribution of the amygdaloid nuclei in each of the FC maps revealed a main effect of Hemisphere (F(1,9080.6) = 296.54, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting increased co-activity values in the amygdala nuclei for the right than the left hemisphere. In addition, there was a main effect of Brain Region (F(8,9089)=396.38, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting that there were differences in co-activity between the nuclei. Furthermore, a main effect of FC maps was found (F(2,9089)=1064.91, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting differences in co-activity between the different whole brain FC maps. Again, important for our present purposes, there was a significant interaction between Brain Region and FC map (F(16,9089)=395.55, p &lt; 0.0001), indicating that the nuclei were not co-activated in the same way across the different FC maps. Further exploration of this interaction using pairwise testing within each FC map and then ranking the nine nuclei revealed the relative contribution of each amygdala nucleus. Specifically, as can be seen in <xref rid="pone.0278962.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, for the FC map correspond to IC2 (correlated with the ventral attention network) summed z-ratios were in descending order ranked Co, AAA, CAT and Ce. Similarly, <xref rid="pone.0278962.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> showed that for FC map associated with IC3 (correlated with the somatomotor network), summed z-ratios were ranked CAT, PL, AAA, AB and Ba. Finally, <xref rid="pone.0278962.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> showed that for the FC map linked to IC11 (correlated with the default mode network) summed z-ratios were ranked Co, AB, CAT, Me and Ce (see also <xref rid="pone.0278962.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref> for a graphical presentation of these results).</p>

        <p>Computation of the whole-brain FC maps for the two additional resting-state volumes in the validation dataset using the seed clusters detected inside the amygdala from the test set revealed a set of results in the validation set that was highly similar to those obtained in the test set (see <xref rid="pone.0278962.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Direct comparisons of the whole-brain FC maps from the test and validation datasets corresponding to ICs 2, 3 and 5 yielded Pearson’s correlations of 0.95, 0.87 and 0.81, respectively. Finally, correlation of these three whole-brain FC maps with the reference Yeo networks yielded similar degrees of overlap with the same networks as detected in the test set (IC2 with VA, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.47; IC3 with SM, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.40; IC5 with DMN, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.65, compare with <xref rid="pone.0278962.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). We can therefore conclude that the clusters of activity detected inside the amygdala are robust and generalize to different datasets.</p>

        <title>Impact of self-reported fear on amygdaloid nucleus co-activity</title>
        <p>Statistical analysis revealed a main effect of Gender (F(1,169)=4.70, p &lt; 0.04), indicating larger co-activity values in the amygdala for women than for men. There was no effect of Age, which therefore was removed from the model. There was an effect of Hemisphere (F(1,9063)=296.76, p &lt; 0.0001), indicating higher co-activity values for the right hemisphere. Furthermore, there was an effect of brain region (F(8,9063)=53.22, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting differences in co-activity values between the nine nuclei. There was also an effect of FC map (F(2,9063)=132.13, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting differences in co-activity between the three FC maps. As before, there was an interaction between brain region and FC map (F(16,9063)=46.85, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting the co-activity values for the various nuclei differed between FC maps. Finally, and important for our present purposes, there was an interaction between Group and brain region (F(8,9063)=2.07, p &lt; 0.04), suggesting that the effect of group was dependent on the brain region. The triple interaction between Group, Brain Region and FC map was not significant. Further exploration of this two way interaction revealed that co-activity values in the high fear group were higher than those in the low fear group for the Co nucleus (z-ratio = 3.322, p &lt; 0.001). Other comparisons were not significant. A visual presentation of these results is shown in <xref rid="pone.0278962.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The current study examined the contributions of nine amygdaloid nuclei to different resting-state networks. The results revealed that the amygdala relied on three distinct resting-state networks and that each network relied on a specific configuration of amygdaloid nuclei. Specifically, the somatomotor network (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.45 with reference network) relied on the CorticoAmygdaloid Transition area (CAT), Paralaminar (PL), Anterior Amygdaloid Area (AAA), Accessory Basal (AB) and Basal (Ba) nuclei. In addition, the ventral attention network (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.48 with reference network) relied on the Cortical (Co), AAA, CAT and Central (Ce) nuclei. Furthermore, the default mode network (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.59 with reference network) was co-activated with the Co, AB, CAT, Medial (Me) and Ce nuclei. These results were validated in a separate dataset. Finally, we also found that participants’ ratings of self-reported fear were associated with co-activity in the Co nucleus.</p>
      <p>These results challenge the classical organization of the amygdala in terms of three large-scale divisions as mentioned in the Introduction (LB, CM, and SF; [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). First, for the somatomotor network (co-activated with CAT, PL, AAA, AB and Ba nuclei), the majority of the activated nuclei belong to the LB division (3/5), while CAT and AAA belong to the SF division (see <xref rid="pone.0278962.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for reference). These results are generally consistent with previous FC studies that have linked the LB and SF sections of the amygdala with primary sensory regions like post-central gyrus, STG and olfactory cortex [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Second, for the ventral attention network (co-activated with Co, AAA, CAT and Ce nuclei), the majority of these nuclei (3/4) can be classified as belonging to the SF division and the Ce nucleus to the CM division. As mentioned in the Introduction, previous studies have not been able to clearly associate particular large-scale amygdala sections with the ventral attention network [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Finally, for the default mode network (co-activated with Co, AB, CAT, Me and Ce nuclei), where nuclei belong to the SF (2/5), CM (2/5) and LB (1/5) divisions. Again, this result is difficult to relate to previous human FC studies because they have not found consistent associations between a specific large-scale subdivision of the amygdala and the default mode network (cf., [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). The current results show that there are three activity clusters in the amygdala that were strongly and uniquely correlated with different whole-brain resting-state networks. Importantly, these three activity clusters cut across the traditional LB, CM and SF subdivisions [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>The observation that the amygdala is related to somatomotor, ventral attention, and default mode networks corroborates previous conclusions about the functional role of the amygdala. First, the observation that the amygdala is related to the somatomotor network is consistent with the overall conception of the amygdala as a structure involved in the on-line evaluation of incoming sensory information (external or internal) in affective terms [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Our findings therefore suggest that the CAT, PL, AAA, AB and Ba amygdala nuclei are especially involved in processing of sensorimotor information. In addition, the involvement of the amygdala with the ventral attention network is consistent with recent findings in both animals and humans that amygdala activity is modulated by the spatial location of an emotionally charged stimulus [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The results reported in the current study implicate the Co, AAA, CAT and Ce amygdala nuclei in the ventral attention network and therefore highlight these nuclei for further examination of the relationship between attention and the amygdala. Finally, altered amygdala connectivity with nodes of the default mode network has been frequently reported in the context of psychiatric disorders (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). For example, it is now relatively well understood that generalized anxiety disorders affect connectivity between the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a key node in the default mode network [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Our finding that the Co, AB, CAT, Me and Ce amygdaloid nuclei were co-activated with the default mode network calls attention to the potential role of these nuclei in various psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression.</p>
      <p>A more complex issue concerns a direct comparison of our results to those obtained in the animal literature. On the one hand, as mentioned in the Introduction, studies of the anatomical connectivity of the amygdala in non-human animals suggest that different brain regions may project to multiple amygdala nuclei [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, for example, areas like the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are known to project to multiple amygdala nuclei [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These observations fit well with the finding that a given resting-state network relied on a complex configuration of amygdaloid nuclei that is not confined to the classic division. On the other hand, as mentioned earlier, studies of the function of the different amygdala nuclei in rodent studies have associated separate functions with separate nuclei ([<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but see [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]). One possibility is that these differences stem from the more constrained experimental tasks used in rodent studies compared to the complex mental states that presumably underlie the various resting-state networks in humans. In this context, an interesting observation in the current study was the absence of La nucleus co-activity. However, given the association between the La nucleus and direct sensory input, this absence may also reflect the resting-state design which does not emphasize sensory input. Future studies with humans that examine the amygdala nuclei with task-based fMRI could shed further light on this issue.</p>
      <p>A pertinent observation in the current study is the relevance of the Co nucleus. This nucleus was strongly co-activated with two of the three observed resting-state networks (Default Mode Network and Ventral Attention network; see <xref rid="pone.0278962.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>), and the co-activation of this nucleus was affected by the self-reported fear of participants (see <xref rid="pone.0278962.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Previous studies in non-human animals have suggested that the cortical nucleus is primarily involved in olfactory processing, and that more posterior sections of this nucleus are linked to memory processes due to connectivity with structures in the medial temporal lobe [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In humans, a number of recent studies have implicated structural changes in the Co nucleus with mood and anxiety related disorders [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For example, [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found that risk for mental illness significantly modulated the volumes of left medial, left central and bilateral cortical nuclei in the amygdala. Similarly, [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found that the major depressive disorder was associated with increased white matter connectivity from the lateral, basal, central and cortical nuclei to the rest of the brain. Thus, our observations that the Co nucleus co-activates with various whole-brain networks as well as its involvement in self-reported fear is in line with these previous findings. Taken together, the results from our study and those previously observed on the involvement of the Co nucleus underscore the need to re-evaluate its function and to consider this nucleus as a target for future clinical research.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>To conclude, in the current study we examined the contributions of nine amygdala nuclei to existing resting-state networks using a high spatial resolution rsfMRI dataset. Our findings show that the amygdala co-activates with three resting-state networks: The somatomotor, ventral attention and default mode network [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, we show that these three networks rely on distinct configurations of co-activity across the nine amygdaloid nuclei that cut across the traditional boundaries between the LB, CM and SF divisions [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These results are in line with animal studies that underscore the complex nature of amygdala connectivity where multiple nuclei connect with many other brain regions [<xref rid="pone.0278962.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0278962.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Finally, the results highlight a special role for the Co nucleus in that this nucleus was most strongly co-activated with the ventral attention and default mode networks, and that its co-activation was associated with the self-reported fear of the study participants. Taken together these results revealed the FC of the amygdala nuclei in a healthy human population and may serve as a baseline against which to evaluate pathological conditions examined in future studies.</p>

      <p>Dear Dr. Janssen,</p>
      <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
      <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Nov 25 2022 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
      <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
      <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
      <p>Kind regards,</p>

</p>
      <p>2. In the Methods section and the online submission form, please provide additional information about the patient records used in your retrospective study. Specifically, please ensure that you have discussed whether all data were fully anonymized before you accessed them and/or whether the IRB or ethics committee waived the requirement for informed consent. If patients provided informed written consent to have data from their medical records used in research, please include this information.</p>
      <p>3. We note that the grant information you provided in the ‘Funding Information’ and ‘Financial Disclosure’ sections do not match. </p>
      <p>When you resubmit, please ensure that you provide the correct grant numbers for the awards you received for your study in the ‘Funding Information’ section.</p>
      <p>4. Thank you for stating the following in the Acknowledgments Section of your manuscript: </p>
      <p>"Data were provided by the Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) funded by the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; and by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University. This work was supported by grants PSI2017-84933-P and PSI2017-91955-EXP to NJ. SLS was supported by a pre-doctoral fellowship from the Canarian Agency for Research, Innovation, Society and Information (ACIISI) and by a graduate grant from the Santander Bank Foundation at the University of La Laguna. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript."</p>
      <p>We note that you have provided funding information that is not currently declared in your Funding Statement. However, funding information should not appear in the Acknowledgments section or other areas of your manuscript. We will only publish funding information present in the Funding Statement section of the online submission form. </p>
      <p>Please remove any funding-related text from the manuscript and let us know how you would like to update your Funding Statement. Currently, your Funding Statement reads as follows: </p>
      <p>"No"</p>
      <p>Please include your amended statements within your cover letter; we will change the online submission form on your behalf.</p>
      <p>5. In your Data Availability statement, you have not specified where the minimal data set underlying the results described in your manuscript can be found. PLOS defines a study's minimal data set as the underlying data used to reach the conclusions drawn in the manuscript and any additional data required to replicate the reported study findings in their entirety. All PLOS journals require that the minimal data set be made fully available. For more information about our data policy, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>Upon re-submitting your revised manuscript, please upload your study’s minimal underlying data set as either Supporting Information files or to a stable, public repository and include the relevant URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers within your revised cover letter. For a list of acceptable repositories, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories</ext-link>. Any potentially identifying patient information must be fully anonymized.</p>
      <p>Important: If there are ethical or legal restrictions to sharing your data publicly, please explain these restrictions in detail. Please see our guidelines for more information on what we consider unacceptable restrictions to publicly sharing data: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions</ext-link>. Note that it is not acceptable for the authors to be the sole named individuals responsible for ensuring data access.</p>

      <p>Reviewer #1: The work by Arguinzones et al is an interesting contribution to the functional connectivity of the different amygdaloid nuclei in resting conditions. Surprinsingly, to my view, the contributions of the different nuclei to the functional networks identified do not correspond to the classical amygdaloid subdivisions. These subdivision are defined mainly based on work in rodents and (to a lesser extent) in non-human primates.</p>
      <p>I have only minor comments:</p>
      <p>- In the abstract, the abbreviations of the amygdaloid subnuclei are not that common to be identified by the readers. I suggest either spelling them out at first use or avoid using abbreviations in the abstract.</p>
      <p>- In the Discussion, it may be worth to include a few lines about possible limitations of the study or limitations with the comparisond with the animal data, which may contribute to explain such important differences with previously defined functional subdivisions. For example, I am not really sure to what extent the medial amygdala or the anterior amygdaloid area in humans are the same structures as those identified with the same names in rodents. Something similar with the cortical nucleus, which in rodents is divided in two olfactory nuclei (anterior cortical and posterolateral cortical) and one vomeronasal (pheromonal) nucleus (posteromedial cortical). To what extent is the functional role of the cortical nucleus in humans comparable to these cortical nuclei in rodents is not an easy question.</p>
      <p>A different kind of caveat is the small size of some of the structures, such as the medial amygdala (as represented in Fig 1). How is this affecting to the data? I guess that the results in this nucleus may not be as robust as those in the larger nuclei.</p>
      <p>Finally, the fact that the lateral nucleus, which is the largest nucleus in the human amygdala and one of the best characterized in the literature in non-human animals, is not involved in any of the functional networks may also deserve a word in the Discussion.</p>
      <p>Page 14, line 5 from the bottom: "contribution each amygdala nucleus" should probably be "contribution OF each amygdala nucleus"</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2: The study used a data-driven approach to investigate the functional connectivity (FC) patterns of the amygdaloid nuclei with existing whole-brain resting state networks. The methods are sound and the results interesting. However, in my opinion, the manuscript needs substantial work in the introduction.</p>
      <p>A description of the functional role of the amygdala (and the amygdaloid nuclei) in the introduction is completely lacking. For example, when listing the main objectives of their work, the authors mention “In addition, we tested whether the self-reported fear of the participants was associated with co-activity in the amygdaloid nuclei”. This comes unexpected, without any description of why this is relevant. What is the proposed functional role of the amygdala and its sub-regions/nuclei? What does self-reported fear mean? Why self-reported fear should be associated with FC of the amygdala? What are the specific hypotheses/predictions concerning the different amygdaloidal nuclei? Please expand the introduction according to these relevant questions. This will allow you to make the introduction more coherent with the discussion, where possible implications of the current results in the clinical field are discussed (but should be maybe more specific).</p>

      <p>Reviewer #1: The work by Arguinzones et al is an interesting contribution to the functional connectivity of the different amygdaloid nuclei in resting conditions. Surprinsingly, to my view, the contributions of the different nuclei to the functional networks identified do not correspond to the classical amygdaloid subdivisions. These subdivision are defined mainly based on work in rodents and (to a lesser extent) in non-human primates.</p>
      <p>I have only minor comments:</p>
      <p>- In the abstract, the abbreviations of the amygdaloid subnuclei are not that common to be identified by the readers. I suggest either spelling them out at first use or avoid using abbreviations in the abstract.</p>
      <p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have rewritten the abstract and improved the abbreviations for nuclei throughout the manuscript.</p>
      <p>- In the Discussion, it may be worth to include a few lines about possible limitations of the study or limitations with the comparisons with the animal data, which may contribute to explain such important differences with previously defined functional subdivisions. For example, I am not really sure to what extent the medial amygdala or the anterior amygdaloid area in humans are the same structures as those identified with the same names in rodents. Something similar with the cortical nucleus, which in rodents is divided in two olfactory nuclei (anterior cortical and posterolateral cortical) and one vomeronasal (pheromonal) nucleus (posteromedial cortical). To what extent is the functional role of the cortical nucleus in humans comparable to these cortical nuclei in rodents is not an easy question. A different kind of caveat is the small size of some of the structures, such as the medial amygdala (as represented in Fig 1). How is this affecting to the data? I guess that the results in this nucleus may not be as robust as those in the larger nuclei.</p>
      <p>We thank the reviewer for these crucial insights. We agree with the reviewer that overall comparisons between humans and animal studies are not straightforward and we believe that future studies that examine the amygdala nuclei with task fMRI (instead of resting-state fMRI) may be beneficial in resolving some of these questions. We discuss these issues in a new paragraph in the general discussion where we go into detail about the comparison between our results and those obtained in non-human animal studies. </p>
      <p>See page 16, line 444</p>
      <p>Finally, the fact that the lateral nucleus, which is the largest nucleus in the human amygdala and one of the best characterized in the literature in non-human animals, is not involved in any of the functional networks may also deserve a word in the Discussion.</p>
      <p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In the added paragraph we also speculate as to why we did not find activity in the LA nucleus. In our opinion this may be related to the nature of the resting-state study that we conducted which by definition only relies on minimal amounts on sensory input. Under such conditions no LA activity may be observed. As we also mentioned before, fMRI studies using tasks (which require strong sensory input) may be able to shed further light on this issue. We again thank the reviewer for bringing up this inspiring point. </p>
      <p>See page 16, line 444</p>
      <p>Page 14, line 5 from the bottom: "contribution each amygdala nucleus" should probably be "contribution OF each amygdala nucleus"</p>
      <p>Fixed.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2: The study used a data-driven approach to investigate the functional connectivity (FC) patterns of the amygdaloid nuclei with existing whole-brain resting state networks. The methods are sound and the results interesting. However, in my opinion, the manuscript needs substantial work in the introduction.</p>

Please expand the introduction according to these relevant questions. This will allow you to make the introduction more coherent with the discussion, where possible implications of the current results in the clinical field are discussed (but should be maybe more specific).</p>
      <p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this up. We have now largely rewritten the Introduction and parts of the Discussion to accommodate the reviewer’s concerns.</p>
      <p>It is not clear if the spatial resolution of fMRI data used in previous studies was lower with respect to HCP data or simply no previous study looked at the single nuclei.</p>
      <p>Indeed the spatial resolution in previous studies was lower (2 to 4 mm) compared to that of the HCP (1.6 mm). It is likely that previous studies have not looked at amygdala nuclei because of this insufficient spatial resolution. </p>
      <p>We hope to have clarified this issue in the current manuscript. </p>
      <p>ICA allowed to identify 3 seeds within the amygdala region. Do they overlap, at least partially, with the large-scale sections previously considered (LB, CM and SF)?</p>
      <p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important point. We have largely rewritten the first two paragraphs of the Discussion section to better highlight this issue in the current version of the manuscript. In the current manuscript we highlight that the relationship between the specific clusters we have found (and the nuclei that are involved in each cluster) and the classical division of the amygdala into LB, CM and SF sections. We hope to have improved our manuscript with respect to this issue.</p>
      <p>rsfMRI, QC, CSF and WM. Please spell out all acronyms the first time you use them.</p>
      <p>Fixed.</p>
      <p>Page 7. Last lines. “These subdivisions do not take into account the concept of the "extended amygdala". Please explain.</p>
      <p>The extended amygdala refers to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the basal forebrain. There is debate in the literature about whether to consider this structure as part of the amygdala (e.g., Lebow &amp; Chen, 2016). The current parcellation of the amygdala into its constituent nuclei (Saygin et al., 2017) does not include this structure.</p>
      <p>We have added some words to better explain this issue. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. </p>
      <p>Methods page 5, line 177</p>
      <p>Please provide additional details for the segmentation method: “by combining prior information about the average structural location of the amygdaloid nuclei and its surrounding tissue with specific structural information from a given participant’s brain”. What specific structural information? For example?</p>
      <p>Specific structural information that is used is the relative position of the surrounding structures (coming from the aparc+aseg file) as well as the specific intensity values present in the T1w file. </p>
      <p>We have updated the manuscript to better explain this issue. </p>
      <p>Methods, page 5, line 180</p>

I would rather talk about “exploring a possible relationship between fear and FC”, without further hypothesis about the direction of the effect. I don’t think we can assume that behavior affects FC.</p>
      <p>We completely agree with the reviewer about this issue and we apologize for the slip up. We did not wish to imply any causality here. We have rewritten these sections. </p>
      <p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments!</p>
