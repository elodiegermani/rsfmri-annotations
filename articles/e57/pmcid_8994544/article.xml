      <abstract>
        <p>The human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; approximately corresponding to Brodmann areas 9 and 46) has demonstrable roles in diverse executive functions such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, inhibition, and abstract reasoning. However, it remains unclear whether this is the result of one functionally homogeneous region or whether there are functional subdivisions within the DLPFC. Here, we divided the DLPFC into seven areas along rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes anatomically and explored their respective patterns of structural and functional connectivity. In vivo probabilistic tractography (11 females and 13 males) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; 57 females and 21 males) were employed to map out the patterns of connectivity from each DLPFC subregion. Structural connectivity demonstrated graded intraregional connectivity within the DLPFC. The patterns of structural connectivity between the DLPFC subregions and other cortical areas revealed that the dorsal-rostral subregions connections were restricted to other frontal and limbic areas, whereas the ventral-caudal region was widely connected to frontal, parietal, and limbic cortex. Functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that subregions of DLPFC were strongly interconnected to each other. The dorsal subregions were associated with the default mode network (DMN), while middle dorsal-rostral subregions were linked with the multiple demand network (MDN). The ventral-caudal subregion showed increased functional coupling with both DMN and MDN. Our results suggest that the connectivity of the DLPFC may be subdivided along a dorsorostral-ventrocaudal axis with differing (albeit graded) patterns of connectivity reflecting the integrative executive function of the DLPFC.</p>
        <p><bold>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</bold> Research has shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a role in various executive functions. By dividing the DLPFC into seven areas along rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes anatomically, we explored their patterns of structural and functional connectivity. The patterns of connectivity within DLPFC subregions demonstrated graded intraregional connectivity. There were distinctive patterns of connectivity with other cortical areas in dorsal-rostral and ventral-caudal DLPFC subregions. Divisions across DLPFC subregions seem to align with their structural and functional connectivity. Our results suggest that DLPFC may be subdivided by the diagonal axis of the dorsal-ventral axis and rostral-caudal axis, supporting the framework of a functional organization along the anterior-posterior axis in the lateral PFC.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) approximately corresponds to Brodmann area (BA)9 and BA46 and consists of the lateral part of superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Brodmann, 1908</xref>; <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Walker, 1940</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Petrides and Pandya, 1999</xref>). More recently, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Petrides (2005b</xref>) designated DLPFC as BA9, BA46, and BA9/46. Previous anatomical and functional studies have demonstrated differences in the subparts of lateral PFC connectivity including the DLPFC (for review, see <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005b</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cieslik et al., 2013</xref>). Although the DLPFC can be divided into two or three subregions cytoarchitectonically, the functional role of each subregion is not clear.</p>
      <p>DLPFC plays an important role in executive functions, such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, inhibition, and abstract reasoning (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Cummings, 2007</xref>) and is connected to a variety of brain regions including the thalamus, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and associative cortex such as posterior temporal, and parietal areas (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Petrides and Pandya, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005b</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Yeterian et al., 2012</xref>). Anatomical studies have demonstrated that different areas within the DLPFC receive their input from distinct subparts of the parietal cortex (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Petrides and Pandya, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2012</xref>) and that the functional role of the DLPFC may be partly determined by its anatomic connections to other brain regions (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Morecraft et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Hoshi, 2006</xref>). Strong evidence from studies with both human and primates suggests an anterior-posterior axis of functional organization of the lateral PFC (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Koechlin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005a</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2012</xref>). Lesions in the caudal DLPFC (BA46 and BA9/46) are associated with a deficit on monitoring of information in working memory whereas additional caudal lesions to BA6 and 8 impair tasks requiring selection between alternative choices (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 1985</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2005a</xref>). The rostral mid-lateral prefrontal regions (BA 10 and 46) play a more abstract role in cognitive control (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005b</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Moayedi et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to the caudal-rostral axis, there is a dorsal-ventral axis of organization of the mid-lateral PFC (DLPFC: BA46 and BA9/46; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Petrides and Pandya, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005b</xref>). In monkeys, the dorsal DLPFC (BA9/46d) plays a role in motor planning, multi-tasking, and maintaining goals whereas the ventral DLPFC (BA9/46v) is preferentially involved in the visuospatial information of attended signals and cues. These findings suggest a possibility that some functionally distinct subparts may exist within the DLPFC.</p>
      <p>Despite the well-documented role of the DLPFC in various executive functions, it remains unclear whether functional subdivisions are present within the DLPFC. DLPFC is activated for a range of cognitive demands such as response inhibition, working memory, and decision-making as a key node of the multiple demand network (MDN), including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), frontal eye field, insular, presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and intraparietal sulcus (IPS; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Duncan, 2010</xref>). Although numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported DLPFC activation, the exact location and extent of activation sites vary according to tasks used in those studies (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Nee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Rottschy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Kohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bahlmann et al., 2015</xref>). One study parcellated the DLPFC using a meta-analysis of task-dependent and task-independent connectivity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cieslik et al., 2013</xref>). They delineated the DLPFC into two regions with different connections: the anterior subregion co-activated with the ACC and the posterior subregion co-activated with the parietal cortex. These findings support functional variation along a rostral-caudal axis in the DLPFC (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005a</xref>). In addition, a dorsal-posterior region of DLPFC was associated with the default mode network (DMN), demonstrating functional connections with posterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial PFC, and angular gyrus (AG; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alves et al., 2019</xref>). Together, the functional heterogeneity and diversity of anatomic connections in the human DLPFC suggests it may consist of functionally distinct subregions.</p>
      <p>Here, we test whether there are connectivity differences across the rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes in the DLPFC that would lead to different functional subregions. We used diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and resting-state fMRI to explore the structural and functional connectivity across the DLPFC in human participants. To improve signal in ventromedial frontal and anterior temporal regions, while maintaining signal across the whole brain, we employed probabilistic tractography of distortion-corrected DWI (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Embleton et al., 2010</xref>) and seed-based analysis of dual-echo resting-state fMRI (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Halai et al., 2014</xref>). The DLPFC was separated into seven different areas based on the rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral divisions of the Brodmann regions (BA9, BA46, and BA9/46; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005b</xref>). For each seed region, we investigated and compared the structural connectivity to 63 target regions including left frontal, temporal, parietal, and limbic cortex and the whole brain functional connectivity. We hypothesized that there would be functional subregions of the DLPFC determined by their structural or functional connectivity and that there would be differential patterns of structural and functional connectivity within the DLPFC along the rostral-caudal or dorsal-ventral axis.</p>

        <title>Subjects and data acquisition</title>
        <p>Two different datasets were employed in this study. Dataset 1 included 24 healthy, right-handed subjects (11 females; mean age = 25.9, range 19–47), whereas dataset 2 included 78 healthy right-handed subjects (57 females; means age = 25.2, range 20–44). Each dataset has been used for various investigations: dataset 1 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Cloutman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bajada et al., 2017a</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2020</xref>) and dataset 2 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2018</xref>). Dataset 1 consisted of distortion-corrected DWI and structural MR imaging. DWI was performed using a pulsed gradient spin echo-planar sequence, with TE = 59 ms, TR ≈ 11,884 ms, G = 62 mTm<sup>−1</sup>, half scan factor = 0.679, 112 × 112 image matrix reconstructed to 128 × 128 using zero padding, reconstructed resolution 1.875 × 1.875 mm, slice thickness 2.1 mm, 60 contiguous slices, 61 noncollinear diffusion sensitization directions at b = 1200 smm<sup>−2</sup> (Δ = 29.8 ms, δ = 13.1 ms), 1 at b = 0, SENSE acceleration factor = 2.5. Acquisitions were cardiac gated using a peripheral pulse unit positioned over the participants' index finger or an electrocardiograph. For each gradient direction, two separate volumes were obtained with opposite polarity <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-space traversal with phase encoding in the left-right/right-left direction to be used in the signal distortion correction procedure (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Embleton et al., 2010</xref>). A co-localized T2 weighted turbo spin echo scan, with in-plane resolution of 0.94 × 0.94 mm and slice thickness 2.1 mm, was obtained as a structural reference scan to provide a qualitative indication of distortion correction accuracy. A high resolution T1-weighted 3D turbo field echo inversion recovery image (TR ≈ 2000 ms, TE = 3.9 ms, TI = 1150 ms, flip angle 8°, 256 × 205 matrix reconstructed to 256 × 256, reconstructed resolution 0.938 × 0.938 mm, slice thickness 0.9 mm, 160 slices, SENSE factor = 2.5) was used.</p>
        <p>Dataset 2 included resting-state fMRI and structural MR imaging. To cover the whole brain without signal dropout around the rostral temporal and inferior frontal cortices, a dual-echo fMRI protocol was performed (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Poser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Halai et al., 2014</xref>). This involves parallel acquisition at a short echo (12 ms) leading to less signal loss in areas of high magnetic susceptibility and a standard long echo (35 ms) to maintain high contrast sensitivity throughout the brain. The results from the two echoes were combined using linear summation, previously shown to be optimal. The fMRI parameters included 42 slices, 80 × 80 matrix, 240 × 240 × 126 mm FOV, in-plane resolution 3 × 3, slice thickness 4 mm. A total of 130 volumes were collected over 6.25 min. T1-weighted structural images were acquired using a 3D MPRAGE pulse sequence with 200 slices, in-plane resolution 0.94 × 0.94-m slice thickness 1.2 mm, TR = 8.4 ms, TE = 3.9 ms. During resting-state fMRI, all subjects were instructed to keep their eyes open and look at the fixation cross. Imaging data were acquired on a 3T Philips Achieva scanner (Philips Medical System). The study was approved by the local ethics committee and all participants provided written informed consent forms.</p>

        <title>Definition of seed regions and target masks</title>
        <p>In order to divide the DLPFC (BA9 and BA46) on the rostral-caudal dimension and to explore differences in DLPFC connectivity, seven anatomically defined regions of interest (ROIs) were located in the left hemisphere (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref><italic toggle="yes">A</italic>): two located on BA9 (anterior: 9a, posterior: 9p), two placed in dorsal-middle frontal gyrus (anterior: 9/46 da, posterior: 9/46dp), one was on BA46 (46), and two placed in ventral-middle frontal gyrus (anterior: 9/46va, posterior: 9/46vp). The seeds regions were identified as a sphere with 6-mm radius in the MNI template brain based on topographic description and defined carefully without overlapping each other. A total of 63 target regions covering frontal, temporal, parietal, and limbic cortex were defined using WFU Pick Atlas (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Maldjian et al., 2003</xref>) and SPM Anatomy toolbox (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Eickhoff et al., 2005</xref>). It should be noted that the occipital lobe was not included in this study because there were no direct white matter pathways connecting the DLPFC and occipital lobe (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Petrides and Pandya, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005b</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Yeterian et al., 2012</xref>). The frontal lobe regions included BA10 (frontal pole; FP), BA44 (pars opercularis), BA45 (pars triangularis), BA47 (pars orbitalis), medial orbitofrontal cortex (medOFC), lateral OFC (latOFC), SMA, and primary motor cortex (M1). The parietal lobe had seven regions in superior parietal cortex (SPC; 5L, 5M, 5Ci, 7A, 7PC, 7M, 7P), three regions in IPS (IPS1, IPS2, IPS3), and seven regions in inferior parietal cortex (IPC; PFop, PFt, PF, PFm, PFcm, PGa, PGp). The temporal lobe had 20 ROIs covering superior temporal gyrus (STG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), fusiform gyrus (FG), parahippocampal gyrus (PhG; please see <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref> for the detailed location of the temporal ROIs). The limbic lobe included insular, amygdala, hippocampus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, and three regions of cingulate cortex [ACC; middle CC (MCC); posterior CC (PCC)]. The DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration using Exponentiated Lie algebra) toolbox (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner, 2007</xref>) was used to transform the seeds and masks from the MNI space into each individual's native diffusion space. The transform was estimated using each subject's T1-weighted image coregistered to their diffusion weighted images. The accuracy of the transformation of ROIs into native space was inspected using the anatomic images. For resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis, ROIs without DARTEL transformations were used, as analysis was performed in the MNI space.</p>

        <title>Probabilistic tractography</title>
        <p>Unconstrained probabilistic tractography was performed using the PICo software package (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Parker and Alexander, 2005</xref>), sampling the orientation of probability density functions (PDFs) which were generated using constrained spherical deconvolution (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Tournier et al., 2008</xref>) and model-based residual bootstrapping (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Haroon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Jeurissen et al., 2011</xref>). A total of 20,000 Monte Carlo streamlines were initiated from each voxel in the DLPFC seed regions. Step size was set to 0.5 mm. Stopping criteria for the streamlines included terminating if the pathway curvature over a voxel was &gt;180°, or the streamline reached a physical path limit of 500 mm. A single whole-brain probabilistic map was generated for each of the seven seed ROIs for each participant. Probability maps were masked with each ROI and the maximum connectivity value (ranging from 0 to 20,000) between the seeds and each mask was extracted. The resultant connectivity matrices were subjected to a double threshold to ensure that only connections with high probability in the majority of participants were considered. For the first-level individual threshold, following the approach described by <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Cloutman et al. (2012)</xref>, the λ-value of the Poisson distribution identified was used to determine a threshold value at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.025. For the second-level group threshold, we used two criteria for consistency (over 75% of participants, i.e., at least 18/24 participants and over 50% of participants, i.e., at least 12/24 participants).</p>

        <title>Resting-state fMRI data analysis</title>
        <p>Preprocessing was performed using SPM 8 and the data processing assistant for resting-state fMRI (DPARSF Advanced Edition, V2.3) toolbox. The first two volumes were discarded to allow for magnetic saturation effects. The images were slice-time corrected, realigned, and coregistered to the individual's structural image using SPM 8. Censoring was applied using a threshold of &gt;3 mm of translation or 1 degree of rotation, which resulted in the exclusion of 6 participants from further analysis. Within DPARSF nuisance covariates were regressed out and the images were normalized using DARTEL, smoothed with an 8-mm full-width half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. The results were filtered at 0.01–0.08 Hz. Nuisance covariates were regressed out including 24 motion parameters calculated from the six original motion parameters using Volterra expansion (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Friston et al., 1996</xref>), which was shown to improve motion correction compared with the six parameters alone (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Power et al., 2014</xref>). Additional covariates were included for outlier time points with a with a <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> score &gt;2.5 from the mean global power or &gt;1 mm translation as identified using the ARtifact detection Tools software package (ART; <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect" ext-link-type="uri">www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect</ext-link>). These were entered as covariates with white matter, CSF, and global tissue signal. Then, linear detrending was performed. Seed-based functional connectivity analyses were performed using DPARSF. Functional connectivity maps from the seeds were <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> score normalized. One-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> tests were used to detect areas with significant connectivity to the seed regions. The resultant images were thresholded at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, FWE-corrected at the cluster level. Comparisons between the functional connectivity maps of different seed regions were conducted using paired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> tests.</p>

        <title>Similarity analysis</title>
        <p>To provide formal spatial inference on the both the comparisons between subregions of DLPFC, we computed the similarity of the connectivity patterns of DLFPC subregions. Using the connectivity patterns of DLPFC subregions, we constructed a similarity matrix for the structural and functional connectivity by conducting correlation analyses between each DLPFC subregion's connectivity patterns. In the similarity matrix, where different DLPFC subregions had similar patterns of connectivity to other brain areas similarity approached 1, whereas where DLPFC subregions connections were dissimilar, similarity was closer to 0. Then, we performed one-sample t tests at each point of the similarity matrix to determine a significant similarity between DLPFC subregions.</p>

        <title>Structural connectivity patterns across the DLPFC</title>
        <p>Using probabilistic tractography, the structural connectivity for each DLPFC seed was identified (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The full pattern of connectivity across the brain is displayed in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. There was strong intra-DLPFC connectivity on the dorsal-ventral axis (along the gyri). Additionally, the mid-DLPFC regions (9/46 da and 9/46dp) showed the strongest intra-DLPFC connectivity, with connections to more dorsal and ventral areas (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref><italic toggle="yes">B</italic>). Across the DLPFC, there was a high level of connectivity with limbic regions, especially the insular and basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, and pallidum; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref><italic toggle="yes">C</italic>). The ventral-caudal seeds (9/46dp, 9/46va, and 9/46vp) showed structural connections with the thalamus. Only 9/46vp had a connection to hippocampus. However, no direct connection was identified between any seed regions and the amygdala. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref><italic toggle="yes">D</italic> shows the pattern of connectivity between the DLPFC seed regions and other lateral associative cortices. Most DLPFC seed regions showed strong connectivity with the FP and IFG (BA44 and BA45) but not the most ventral aspects of the PFC, including pars orbitalis (BA47) and the OFC. Only the ventral-caudal seeds (9/46va and 9/46vp) had strong evidence of connections to primary and supplementary motor regions. Additionally, only the 9/46vp seed connects to somatosensory and dorsal parietal regions (7PC and IPS). It should be noted that the DLPFC seed regions did not show any connection with the temporal and inferior parietal cortices. Overall, all DLPFC seeds showed strong connectivity with the FP, IFG, and the limbic system. The tractography results suggest a single axis of changing connectivity from ventral-caudal to dorsal-rostral regions, with the key differences being between the most ventral-caudal regions and elsewhere. Specifically, the ventral-caudal seeds (9/46va and 9/46vp) show the widespread structural connectivity to frontal, limbic, sensorimotor, and SPC.</p>

        <p>The whole-brain rsFC map of each DLPFC seed region is displayed in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. Overall, the seven ROIs showed the involvement in two distinct networks with gradedly different rsFC patterns suggesting a transition between these networks. The two BA9 seeds (9a and 9p) were primarily correlated with the regions of the DMN, including medial PFC (mPFC), OFC, IPC (particularly AG), precuneus, PCC, anterior/middle temporal regions, and hippocampus (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Buckner et al., 2008</xref>). All other seed regions were strongly correlated with brain regions of the MDN, including IFG, SMA, ACC/MCC, SPC, IPS, supramarginal gyrus, and pMTG (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Duncan and Owen, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Woolgar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Spreng et al., 2013</xref>). However, area 9/46vp showed connectivity with both the MDN and the DMN. All DLPFC seed regions were strongly functionally connected to the insular and basal ganglia regions. The results appear to vary along the dorsal-ventral axis such that the dorsal parts of the DLPFC are connected with the DMN, whereas the ventral parts of DLPFC are associated with the MDN. Similar to the structural connectivity results, the most ventral-caudal seed (9/46vp) shows widespread functional connectivity across both of the DMN and MDN.</p>

The comparisons between the more rostral and caudal ventral seed regions exhibited prominent differences in similar regions. Relatively rostral regions showed higher rsFC with regions of the MDN including the IFG, SMA, M1/S1, supramarginal gyrus, ACC/MCC and visual cortex, yet lower rsFC with DMN regions, such as the mPFC, OFC, AG, precuneus, PCC, and lateral temporal cortex, than more caudal regions.</p>

        <p>The connectivity profile of the DLPFC seed regions is displayed in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref><italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. Overall, the seed regions showed more widespread connections to target regions functionally than structurally (although the structural connectivity of 9/46vp was quite extensive), with structural connectivity mainly limited to the frontal and limbic cortex. With a more liberal threshold in structural connectivity (25% of the participants), the dorsal-caudal seeds (9p and 9/46dp) and the ventral-rostral seed (46) showed a connection with the ACC and the most ventral-caudal seed (9/46vp) had a connection to the posterior MTG and AG (PGa; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref><italic toggle="yes">A</italic>).

        <p>To compare the connectivity patterns of DLFPC regions, we used our ROIs and computed similarity of connectivity patterns across DLPFC sub regions. The similarity matrix for structural and functional connectivity was constructed by computing the patterns of similarity (Pearson's correlation; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref><italic toggle="yes">B</italic>). Then, we compared the similarity matrix between the DLPFC seed regions. The similarity results of structural connectivity revealed that most DLPFC subregions had similar patterns of connectivity such that the dorsal regions of DLPFC showed strong similarity to the ventral-anterior part of DLPFC (9/46va) and neighboring regions along the rostral-caudal axis also revealed very similar patterns of connectivity. However, 9/46vp did not showed such similarity with 9a, 9/46 da, and 46 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref><italic toggle="yes">C</italic>, left). It demonstrated the distinctive patterns of structural connectivity between the most ventral-caudal region from dorsal-caudal regions (9a, 9/46 da, and 46). Functional similarity of DLPFC subregions showed that (1) neighboring regions showed similar patterns of connectivity and (2) the dorsal regions (9a and 9p) did not have functional similarity with the ventral regions (46 and 9/46va; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref><italic toggle="yes">C</italic>, right). Importantly, the ventral-caudal region showed the similar pattern of functional connectivity with all other DLPFC subregions, which is supported by its widespread structural connectivity.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We investigated the patterns of connectivity in subregions of DLPFC along the rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes. We showed that subregions of DLPFC had differential structural and functional connectivity. Divisions across DLPFC subregions seem to align with their structural and functional connectivity. Structural connectivity analyses demonstrated graded intraregional connectivity within the DLPFC. The patterns of connectivity between the DLPFC subregions and other cortical areas revealed a separation of dorsal-rostral subregions from the most ventral-caudal subregion. The dorsal-rostral subregions were restricted to link other frontal and limbic areas, whereas the ventral-caudal region was widely connected to frontal, temporal, parietal, and limbic cortex. The patterns of functional connectivity revealed that subregions of DLPFC were strongly interconnected to each other within the whole frontal cortex and coupled with two functional brain networks: MDN and DMN. The dorsal subregions were associated with the DMN, while middle dorsal-rostral subregions were linked with the MDN, respectively. Similar to the results of structural connectivity, the most ventral-caudal subregion showed increased functional coupling with both DMN and MDN. Our results suggest that DLPFC may be subdivided by the diagonal axis of the dorsal-ventral axis and rostral-caudal axis. Our findings support the framework of a functional organization along the anterior-posterior axis in the lateral PFC (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Petrides and Pandya, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Koechlin et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The Cascade model proposes that executive control is implemented across the lateral PFC along a posterior-to-anterior hierarchy, from simple to more abstract cognitive control processing (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Koechlin et al., 2003</xref>). For example, posterior DLPFC supports action selection based on sensory input and anterior DLPFC provides episodic control for action selection, taking into account the ongoing context. The frontopolar cortex supports branching control for action selection based on a holding temporal context. Our structural connectivity results support this progressive posterior to anterior hierarchy within the DLPFC subregions, showing highly interconnected subregions within each gyri via short U-fibers, as well as DLPFC connections with the FP, IFG and motor regions via short frontal tracks (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Catani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Yeterian et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, the dorsal-rostral subregions connected to the FP via the frontal aslant tract, while the ventral-caudal subregions connect to sensory motor regions through the frontal longitudinal tracts. Similarly, our functional connectivity results demonstrated that subregions of DLPFC had strong coupling with other frontal regions including the FP, IFG, OFC, and motor cortex. The results of the intra-DLPFC connectivity were strong (especially between the neighboring regions) and graded, presumably reflecting local U-shaped fibers with few sharp divisions (9a was not structurally connected with other DLPFC seeds). The graded intra-DLPFC connectivity is consistent with primarily similar local computations, such that the region as a whole has the properties of mass action (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Farah and McClelland, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, these patterns of connectivity within the DLPFC, along with connection to other frontal areas, suggest there is a graded and integrative organization of the whole frontal lobe (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Petrides and Pandya, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005b</xref>).</p>
      <p>We observed that the dorsal-rostral subregions (anterior parts of the DLPFC) were linked to the frontopolar regions with increased functional connectivity with the DMN. The frontopolar cortex is a supramodal area involved in various higher order functions such as self-directed thought, rational integration, the simultaneous consideration of multiple relations, and cognitive branching, holding goals while exploring secondary goals, planning, and reasoning (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Ramnani and Owen, 2004</xref>). With co-activation of the frontopolar cortex, it has reported that the DMN could be activated for self-generated thought (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Christoff et al., 2016</xref>) or increased cognitive reasoning complexity (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Sormaz et al., 2018</xref>). These studies support our findings that dorsal-rostral subregions of the DLPFC were strongly coupled with the DMN. In line with the anterior-posterior gradient in the PFC, our connectivity analysis suggests that the anterior parts of the DLPFC would be involved in more challenging cognitive control, such as complex cognitive reasoning and cognitive branching.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the middle-ventral subregions (middle-posterior parts) were connected to the IFG (BA44 and BA45) with strong coupling with the MDN and the ventral-caudal region (the most posterior part) had anatomic connections with temporal and parietal areas with increased functional connectivity with both DMN and MDN. Several corticocortical association pathways link the PFC and other cortical regions (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Petrides and Pandya, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005b</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Catani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Yeterian et al., 2012</xref>). The superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) links the PFC and parietal cortex. SLF has three distinct branches: SLF I connecting the superior frontal area (BA8, BA9, BA32) to SPC, SLF II connecting the SFG/MFG to IPS/AG, SLF III connecting IFG to IPS. The arcuate fasciculus (AF) connects the posterior regions of the frontal lobe and temporal lobe (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 2005</xref>). The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) connects occipital cortex, temporal areas, ventrolateral frontal cortex and inferior parietal regions (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Schmahmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Martino et al., 2010</xref>). As a part of the MDN, the IFG is involved in cognitive control and language processing (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brass et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Camilleri et al., 2018</xref>). As the IPS has an anatomical connection with the DLPFC via SLF I/SLF II (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Petrides and Pandya, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005a</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2012</xref>), the IPS acts as a multifaceted behavioral integrator, binding task-relevant information from the sensory, motor, and cognitive domains, mediated by the top-down control of DLPFC (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gottlieb, 2007</xref>). These findings suggest that the middle-posterior parts of the DLPFC would be associated with the core processes of cognitive control, supporting the anterior-to-posterior functional organization of the DLPFC.</p>
      <p>In our results, the middle-ventral subregions did not show anatomic connections with the IPS but they were functionally coupled with the MDN. One explanation of this discrepancy is that a weak anatomic connection between two regions may still hold a high functional significance via indirect connections of shared brain regions (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Friston, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Damoiseaux and Greicius, 2009</xref>). Functional connectivity does not necessarily require direct, physical connections and several studies have reported functional connections between regions without anatomic connectivity (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Damoiseaux and Greicius, 2009</xref>). Therefore, the functional connectivity without physical connections potentially results from indirect anatomic connections via shared brain areas.</p>
      <p>The DLPFC is functionally and structurally connected with subcortical areas including the insular and ACC (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Catani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cieslik et al., 2013</xref>). As core areas of the MDN, insular and ACC play a role in cognitively demanding tasks, responding to uncertainty and emotional salience (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Menon and Uddin, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Camilleri et al., 2018</xref>). A meta-analysis study demonstrated strong functional connectivity between DLPFC and insular/ACC (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cieslik et al., 2013</xref>). We also showed significant functional connectivity between insular/ACC and the DLPFC. However, our tractography analyses showed structural connections between the DLPFC and insular only, not the ACC. With a lower threshold, we found some evidence of a connection between the DLPFC regions and ACC (25% of participants). In addition, we showed that the corticostriatum projections directly link all DLPFC subregions to the basal ganglia and thalamus (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Jarbo and Verstynen, 2015</xref>). In particular, the anatomic connections between the basal ganglia and DLPFC form a neural circuit involved in several aspects of goal directed behaviors (for review, see <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Haber, 2003</xref>), which supports a role for the DLPFC in action control (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Petrides, 2005b</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cieslik et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the extensive connections from the basal ganglia to the cerebral cortex potentially account for the discrepancy between the structural and functional connectivity in the DLPFC subregions.</p>
      <p>Although most studies investigating the MDN have focused on the context of goal-directed tasks, it has been shown to play an important role in regulating self-generated thoughts, autobiographical memory, social and emotional information, which are thought to be associated with the DMN (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Spreng and Grady, 2010</xref>). In particular, DLPFC may play a crucial role in modulating these forms of information (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Spreng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Turnbull et al., 2019</xref>). Emerging evidence suggest that the executive and default network coupling is associated with self-regulation, memory, planning, cognitive control, and creative thinking (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Spreng and Grady, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Spreng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Beaty et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with these studies, our results demonstrated that DLPFC was coupled with both DMN and MD, showing differential connectivity with subregions of DLPFC. Our findings support the default–executive coupling hypothesis that default and control networks can cooperate to facilitate goal-directed cognition (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the current study, we explored the structural and functional connectivity across the subregions of DLPFC using probabilistic tractography and resting-state fMRI approaches. The key limitations of probabilistic tractography are the issues of distance effect and thresholding (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2008</xref>). A degree of uncertainty in fiber orientation exists at each step in the propagation of a pathway. This accumulation of uncertainty from voxel to voxel as the streamline is advanced causes a decrease in probability with increasing path length and a progressive dispersion of the streamlines with the distance from the seed (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is difficult to determine a threshold value which will identify true positives while simultaneously minimizing the rate of both Type I errors in regions close to the seed and Type II errors in distant regions. Although our procedure most likely produced a conservative cutoff value for longer pathways (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Binney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Cloutman et al., 2012</xref>), there may be long-range connections left undetected.</p>
