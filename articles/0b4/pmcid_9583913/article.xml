          <title>Background and objectives</title>
          <p>Glaucoma is one of the leading irreversible causes of blindness worldwide, and previous studies have shown that there is abnormal functional connectivity (FC) in the visual cortex of glaucoma patients. The thalamus is a relay nucleus for visual signals; however, it is not yet clear how the FC of the thalamus is altered in glaucoma. This study investigated the alterations in thalamic FC in patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) by using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). We hypothesized that PACG patients have abnormal FC between the thalamus and visual as well as extravisual brain regions.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Clinically confirmed PACG patients and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were evaluated by T1 anatomical and functional MRI on a 3 T scanner. Thirty-four PACG patients and 33 HCs were included in the rs-fMRI analysis. All PACG patients underwent complete ophthalmological examinations; included retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), intraocular pressure (IOP), average cup-to-disc ratio (A-C/D), and vertical cup-to-disc ratio (V-C/D). After the MRI data were preprocessed, the bilateral thalamus was chosen as the seed point; and the differences in resting-state FC between groups were evaluated. The brain regions that significantly differed between PACG patients and HCs were identified, and the correlations were then evaluated between the FC coefficients of these regions and clinical variables.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Compared with the HCs, the PACG patients showed decreased FC between the bilateral thalamus and right transverse temporal gyrus, between the bilateral thalamus and left anterior cingulate cortex, and between the left thalamus and left insula. Concurrently, increased FC was found between the bilateral thalamus and left superior frontal gyrus in PACG patients. The FC between the bilateral thalamus and left superior frontal gyrus was positively correlated with RNFLT and negatively correlated with the A-C/D and V-C/D. The FC between the left thalamus and left insula was negatively correlated with IOP.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Extensive abnormal resting-state functional connections between the thalamus and visual and extravisual brain areas were found in PACG patients, and there were certain correlations with clinical variables, suggesting that abnormal thalamic FC plays an important role in the progression of PACG.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Glaucoma, a group of blinding eye diseases characterized by optic atrophy and visual field defects, is one of the major irreversible causes of blindness worldwide. Currently, there are ~76 million glaucoma patients in our country, and the number is expected to increase to 1.12 billion by 2040 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Primary glaucoma can be divided into primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor for glaucoma, and damage to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by elevated IOP is considered to a key factor in the pathogenesis of glaucoma (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, RGCs are extensions of the central nervous system developmentally and anatomically. And many studies have shown that glaucoma is not only an eye disease but also a degenerative disease of the central nervous system (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
      <p>Previous MRI studies mostly focused on POAG, which has a high incidence in Western countries, and found spontaneous functional connectivity changes in the primary visual cortex (V1) of POAG patients (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). By contrast, in China and throughout Asia, the most common type of glaucoma is PACG (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and glaucoma patients there suffer a higher prevalence of blindness than those in Western countries (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Recently, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has been increasingly used to explore intrinsic brain activity in glaucoma patients and has provided critical information in the search for pathological mechanisms (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Several recent studies have shown that PACG patients exhibit abnormalities in regional homogeneity (ReHo) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) in multiple brain regions. And Tong et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) found that there is disturbed interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity in the vision-related brain areas of individuals with PACG. In additional, our group also found that PACG patients showed brain dysfunction in visual and other regions and presented different spatial distributions of short-range and long-range functional connectivity density (FCD) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
      <p>As the largest mixed nucleus of gray and white matter in the deep part of the brain, the thalamus is involved in multiple functions, such as visual information transmission, cognition, emotion, sensation, and movement. The alternation of thalamus in the visual conduction pathway are the main impairment of central nervous system in glaucoma (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Karlen et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) demonstrated that early blindness showed alterations of thalamocortical connections. Reislev et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) found that blind individuals showed thalamocortical connectivity and microstructural changes. And a recent animal experiment (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) suggested that changes in the thalamus may predate damage to RGCs. However, the literature on thalamic function in PACG patients remains scarce.</p>
      <p>In this study, we searched for evidence of abnormal functional connectivity in the thalamus of PACG patients by examining resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC), which focuses on statistical correlations between signals in the whole brain or within brain regions (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), showing great potential as a method to explore synchronous activity in the brain. The main purposes of this study were to explore the FC relationship between the thalamus and the whole brain of PACG patients, and relate the alterations in FC to clinical data by analyzing the correlation between clinical parameters and the significantly changed regions.</p>

        <title>Subjects</title>
        <p>Forty right-handed PACG patients were recruited from the Ophthalmology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. The inclusion criteria for the PACG patients were as follows: (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) narrow anterior chamber angles in both eyes, confirmed clinically by gonioscopy and slit-lamp examination; (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) visual field defects associated with glaucoma, such as tubular vision and nasal hemianopia; (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) an optic nerve cup-to-disc ratio &gt; 0.6, as determined by funduscopic examination; and (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) didn't received medical or surgical treatment for glaucoma. The exclusion criteria for the PACG patients were as follows: (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) the diagnosis of another type of glaucoma, such as POAG or secondary glaucoma; (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) the diagnosis of another ocular disease or an organic disorder affecting the visual pathway; (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) a history of brain trauma; (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) a history of underlying disease, such as hypertension or diabetes; (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) a history of surgical treatment for glaucoma; (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) incomplete data from MRI scans or clinical assessment; and (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) head movement exceeding 2.5 mm maximum displacement in the x, y, and/or z directions or 2.5° of angular rotation about any axis during the rs-fMRI examination. Ultimately, 34 PACG patients (16 males and 18 females) were included in this study (4 had incomplete clinical data, and two had head movement &gt; 2.5 mm or &gt; 2.5° during the rs-fMRI examination).</p>
        <p>We recruited and selected 33 right-handed, age- and gender-matched healthy subjects to serve as healthy controls (HCs; 16 males and 17 females). The exclusion criteria for the HCs were as follows: (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) the diagnosis of an ocular disorder or other systemic disease; (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) severe nearsightedness or farsightedness; (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) contraindications for MRI, such as metal implants or claustrophobia; and (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) head movement exceeding 2.5 mm maximum displacement in the x, y, and/or z directions or 2.5° of angular rotation about any axis.</p>
        <p>This study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University approved the study protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to the study. <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides information on the demographics of the PACG patients and HCs.</p>

        <title>Data acquisition</title>
        <p>The rs-fMRI data were acquired using a 3T MR scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with an 8-channel phased-array head coil at the Department of Radiology of the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, China. All subjects were directed to sit for 10 min prior to their resting-state scans. Next, they were instructed to keep their eyes closed but to not fall asleep. The subjects were further instructed to not engage in any specific cognitive activity during data acquisition. Head movements and noise were suppressed using a suitable sponge mat and earplugs, respectively. Rs-fMRI data acquisition lasted for 8 min, and 240 resting-state volumes were acquired using the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2,000 ms; echo time (TE) = 40 ms; flip angle = 90°; field of view (FOV) = 240 mm × 240 mm; matrix =64 × 64; and slice thickness = 4 mm with a 1 mm gap. Each brain volume included 30 axial slices. High-resolution T1-weighted images for each subject were acquired using a 3D MRI sequence with the following parameters: TR = 1,900 ms; TE = 2.26 ms; flip angle = 9°; FOV= 240 mm × 240 mm; matrix = 256 × 256; number of sagittal slices = 176; and slice thickness = 1 mm.</p>

        <title>Data preprocessing</title>
        <p>MRIcro software was used to check the resting-state fMRI data and discard any data of suboptimal quality. Rs-fMRI data were preprocessed with the Data Processing &amp; Analysis for Brain Imaging (DPABI) toolbox (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), which was run in MATLAB 2018b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, United States). First, the first 10 time points were removed. Then, the remaining 230 volumes were corrected for slice timing and three-dimensional head motion. Two PACG patients were excluded because the maximum displacement in at least one direction (x, y, and/or z) was more than 2.0 mm; the angular rotation about some axis exceeded 2.0°; or the framewise displacement (FD), a relative displacement measure, exceeded 2.5 standard deviations for any of the 230 volumes during the entire fMRI scanning process. Then, all the functional data were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template using non-linear transformation procedures in SPM12 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), resampled to 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm voxels, and smoothed with a 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) filter. Finally, a temporal filter (0.01–0.08 Hz) was utilized to suppress the effects of low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise. To further reduce the influence of confounding factors, a multiple regression method was performed to regress out interference, including the mean time series of all white matter and cerebrospinal fluid voxels, global signals and Friston's 24-parameter model of head motion (6 head motion parameters, six head motion parameters from one time point earlier, and the 12 corresponding squared items) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p>

        <p>We selected the bilateral thalamic region marked by the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template in WFU_PickAtlas software as the region of interest (ROI) for FC analysis and extracted the time series of all voxels in the ROI as the time series of the ROI; the same was done for the whole brain. The time series of all voxels were subjected to Pearson correlation FC analysis to obtain an FC correlation coefficient map; Fisher's z transformation was then performed to align the data more closely with the normal distribution and facilitate statistical analysis.</p>

        <title>Clinical assessment</title>
        <p>All patients underwent detailed ophthalmological examination. The state of the anterior chamber angle was determined by gonioscopy and slit-lamp examination. IOP was measured using a tonometer, while retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), the average cup-to-disc ratio (A-C/D) and the vertical cup-to-disc ratio (V-C/D) were evaluated by optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT). In addition, the disease course and visual acuity (VA) were recorded.</p>

        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>The chi-square test was used to compare the categorical variable of gender between groups, and an independent-samples <italic>t</italic>-test was used for measurement variables (age and clinical ophthalmology parameters); these tests were implemented in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0 (Chicago, IL, United States). When <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, the differences were considered significant.</p>
        <p>For the rs-FC between each ROI and the remaining voxels of the brain, two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were conducted between the two groups to identify differences in spatial distribution. Then, analysis of covariance was applied to analyze intergroup differences, with gender and age as covariates, using DPABI software in MATLAB 2018b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, United States). The results were corrected using AlphaSim implemented in DPABI Viewer with p &lt;0.05 and were reported using REST V1.84. The resulting z value maps were overlaid on the rendered views using BrainNet Viewer, and the locations of the brain regions with significant FC were reported using xjView software.</p>
        <p>To examine whether there is a relationship between abnormal FC and clinical variables, we used the statistical software package SPSS 24.0 to conduct Pearson correlation analysis between the FC strength of different brain regions and the results of clinical scales; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

        <p>The results of intergroup rs-FC comparisons at the voxel-based whole-brain level based on bilateral thalamic seeds are displayed in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Compared with the HCs, the PACG patients showed decreased FC between the bilateral thalamus and right transverse temporal gyrus (TTG), between the bilateral thalamus and left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and between the left thalamus and left insular (INS). Concurrently, increased FC was found between the bilateral thalamus and left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>–<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Interestingly, either the decreased or increased FC values of all the above regions were lower or higher than the FC values of the corresponding brain regions in the HC groups (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The main finding of this study is that PACG patients show extensive abnormalities in FC among multiple brain regions, including regions involved in vision, hearing, emotion, and cognition, which is consistent with our hypothesis.</p>
      <p>In our current study, we noticed decreased FC of the bilateral thalamus with the right TTG and the left ACC in PACG patients. The TTG is located in the primary auditory cortex in the lateral sulcus of the brain and is the first cortical structure to receive auditory information, indicating that the auditory function of PACG patients was impaired. Both the auditory cortex and the ACC belong to the frontotemporal network which has been shown to be involved in auditory information processing for cognitive purposes (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Many studies (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) have found that glaucoma patients have structural and functional abnormalities in the projections from the thalamus to the higher visual cortices, but the connections with the auditory cortex are rarely studied, likely because glaucoma patients mainly present with ocular symptoms rather than hearing impairment. The decreased connectivity between the thalamus and auditory cortex in patients with major depression may lead to mismatched processing at the cortical level, contributing to these patients' clinical symptoms (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In addition, the ALFF value in the ACC is significantly reduced in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is positively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, suggesting that the ALFF value in this region may be an imaging indicator of cognitive dysfunction (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Thus, we speculated that the PACG might lead to the reorganization of auditory and cognitive function. Similar results that no disruption of measures were also observed in a previous study regarding glaucoma patients (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), hinting that the efficiency of communication in the brain network was conserved and the brain was homogeneously well reorganized.</p>
      <p>In addition, the INS cortex is extensively connected to the frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, and limbic regions and participates in multiple processes, such as emotional, cognitive and motor sensory information processing (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Many previous studies (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) found abnormalities in the structure and function of the INS in glaucoma patients. For example, Chen et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) found that the ReHo value of the right INS in PACG patients was elevated, and Chen et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) found that short-range functional connectivity density (FCD) was increased in the left INS of PACG patients and negatively correlated with the A-C/D. In addition, Li et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) found that preoperative PACG patients had lower FC in the left primary visual cortex and left INS than controls, which is consistent with the results of our study. Clinically, many PACG patients present with anxiety or even depression (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). A study (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) showed that the FC of the INS in patients with schizophrenia was generally decreased. Therefore, the decreased rs-fMRI FC between the thalamus and INS in PACG patients may be due to impaired emotional cognitive regulation pathways. However, from the results, the individual differences within the PACG group are relatively large, and a generalizable result may not be drawn. However, this result is not highly reliable because of the large individual variability within the group. The current study cannot explain this result sufficiently, but we will focus on its causes in future research.</p>
      <p>The correlation analysis showed that the FC of the left thalamus and left INS in PACG patients was negatively correlated with IOP. Therefore, we speculate that elevated IOP leads to emotional disturbances in glaucoma patients, which would, in turn, lead to dysfunction of the INS.</p>
      <p>The left SFG is located above the orbit and is mainly involved in eye movement, visual positioning, advanced cognition and working memory functions (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Neuroimaging studies (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) have identified functional interactions between the thalamus and the default-mode network (DMN), and the brain regions with increased FC (the SFG) and decreased FC (the ACC) both belong to the DMN. Owing to the death of retinal ganglion cells in PACG patients, the transmission of visual information in PACG patients is blocked, which results in decreased FC between the thalamus and DMN nodes (such as the ACC). To compensate for the decreased FC between the networks, the thalamus and other regions of the DMN (such as the SFG) have increased FC. Many diseases damage the brain regions associated with the DMN, which consumes a great deal of energy in the resting state and is especially susceptible to oxidative stress and disease. For example, Wang et al. (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) found that the FC between the DMN and the visual network was decreased in POAG patients and was positively correlated with the average visual field. Additionally, a previous application of the degree centrality (DC) analysis method to this topic by our group, showed that the DC value of a DMN brain region (ACC) increased in PACG patients (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), indicating that glaucoma patients do have abnormal DMN function.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, other factors, such as local neuroplasticity, may play a compensatory role during the progression of glaucoma. Neuroplasticity is a selective phenomenon that functionally and structurally molds synaptic connections of the nervous system through experience (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Several research (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) have found a perceptual boost in the responses of the deprived eye following short-term monocular deprivation in amblyopic patients. Similar results were also observed in glaucoma patients (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). For patients with glaucoma, the decreasing function of visual cortex, which may compensatory increase the function of other brain regions.</p>
      <p>The FC between the bilateral thalamus and the left SFG was positively correlated with the RNFLT, and the RNFLT was associated with the progression of glaucoma. Therefore, we speculate that the progression of glaucoma may be accompanied by cognitive impairment. However, the FC between the bilateral thalamus and left SFG was negatively correlated with A-C/D and V-C/D, while A-C/D and V-C/D were positively correlated with the incidence of glaucoma and impairment of the anterior visual pathway (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), indicating that the brain's compensatory action cannot reverse the development of glaucoma and damage to the eye.</p>

      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p>There are several limitations to our study. First, the patients' emotions were not measured. PACG patients have been reported to be more sensitive to negative affective states, such as depression and anxiety, than HCs or even POAG patients. Detailed psychological scales should be included in any further research on this topic. Second, longitudinal research is lacking. The duration glaucoma disease varies greatly, and so the specific temporal relationship between brain activity alterations and disease stage is still unclear.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In conclusion, there are extensive abnormalities in resting-state FC between the thalamus and vision, hearing, emotion, and cognition related brain regions in PACG patients, and these differences are correlated with clinical variables, which suggests that abnormal FC of the thalamus plays an important role in the progression of PACG.</p>
