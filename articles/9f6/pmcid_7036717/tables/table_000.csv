How data were acquired,Siemens whole-body 3T fMRI scannerAbbreviated Torrance Test for Adults (ATTA); Creative Behaviour Inventory (CBI); and Creative Achievement Questionnaire (CAQ)
Data format,Raw
Parameters for data collection,"Data collection incorporated the following parameters. 1) Participant demographics (age 22 to 35): right-handed, normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing, no history of psychological or neurological disorders, no substance abuse, able to keep still in a mock MRI scanner with no claustrophobia, able to perform above chance on memory tests, and voluntary participation; 2) neuroimaging protocol (???); 3) Behavioural testing environment (computer in a laboratory-controlled setting)."
Description of data collection,"In a controlled laboratory setting with a computer, participants completed the ATTA, CAQ and CBI. In a separate session, participants returned for MRI scanning. The day prior to MRI scanning, participants completed 45 minutes of motion biofeedback training, both to become better habituated to an MRI-like environment, and to learn to reduce their head movement."
