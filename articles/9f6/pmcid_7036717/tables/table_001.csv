"Value of the Data•The current dataset provides a link between different known dimensions of a person's creativity on the one hand, and the anatomical and functional structure of that person's brain on the other.•Cognitive neuroscience researchers may find the data valuable for elucidation of the neural substrates of creativity.•This dataset can be used by researchers developing more sophisticated neural models of creativity who are in need of data for testing those models.•This dataset is uniquely high-dimensional in measuring both multiple dimensions of creativity, their facets, and multimodal brain data.•The current sample can be combined with others to establish the larger sample sizes needed for testing more complex neurocognitive models."
