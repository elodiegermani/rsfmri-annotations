Condition,Summary
Parkinson's disease,"FC in Parkinson's commonly follows a pattern of hypoconnectivity, particularly in BG but also often between BG and other regions. Methodologies focusing on the BG differentiate FC differences in Parkinson's compared to Alzheimer's disease. Methodologies not primarily focusing on BG may also see FC reductions associated with cortical-midbrain connections. Pre-op FC between STN and GPi is positively correlated with STN-DBS improvement. Normative (non-patient) FC between superimposed lead locations and M1 (anticorrelation) and SMA, anterior cingulate, and PFC (positive correlation) are associated with STN-DBS outcomes."
Dystonia,"FC in dystonia seems to follow a pattern of almost always hyperconnectivity within/between deep-gray regions and then a mixture of hyper and hypo connectivity between deep gray and cortical/cerebellar regions as well as a mixture of hypo and hyperconnectivity between motor, sensory, association, and cognitive regions. At times, this is variable by study method. Hypoconnectivity between BG and cortical regions may also vary by type of dystonia (e.g., area affected by dystonia)."
Generalized idiopathic dystonia,"In patients, preoperative FC between GPi-DBS lead locations and M1/S1, motor thalamus, and cerebellum are positively correlated with outcomes, while FC between GPi-DBS lead locations and SMA and premotor cortex are negatively associated with outcomes."
Cervical dystonia,"Often increased FC in BG and between BG and thalamus compared to controls. Some studies show hypoconnective FC between BG/thalamus and M1/S1 regions. Whole-brain studies show mixtures of increased and decreased FC between cortical regions. FC with regions of the cerebellum, within BG, and between BG and thalamus, M1, and S1 are reduced with botox injections. Some atypical (compared to HC) cortical FC is made normal or more HC-like after botox injections."
Blepharospasm/Orofacial dystonia,"Widespread reduced FC between caudate/putamen and cortical regions, as well as between cerebellar regions and between cerebellar and motor and visual regions compared to HC. After botox, widespread reduced FC including between BG and cerebellum, between BG structures, between cerebellar and visual and premotor (including frontal eye field) regions, between thalamus and premotor/SMA regions. Additionally, botox is associated with FC increases between cerebellum and associative visual cortex."
Writer's cramp,"Increased BC FC (left putamen) and decreased FC within S1 and between motor hand area and superior parietal lobule. Additionally, FC in the intraparietal sulcus (associated with coordination of hand-eye movement) has been negatively corelated with disease duration and FC in parts of the superior parietal lobule associated with somatosensory guidance of movement were positively correlated with disease severity (Less FC with greater severity)."
Musician's dystonia,"Increased BG FC (right anterior putamen), these increases were not correlated with skill."
Spasmodic dysphonia,"Increased FC between thalamus and BG as well as FC increases between many (cortical) sensorimotor, auditory, and cerebellar locations. Reduced FC between insula and semantic processing regions and well are between thalamus and motor (speech) regions. Connectivity between thalamus and caudate was positively associated with clinical severity."
Brain insult (perinatal-4 years),"Reduction of FC networks can be widespread and associated with motor outcomes, especially motor, sensory, BG, and cerebellar networks. Additionally, increased intra-hemispheric, decreased interhemispheric, and impaired lateralization of FC is associated with motor outcomes. However, very preterm infants had less association between BG networks and motor function scores and BG/thalamic networks were associated with posture)."
