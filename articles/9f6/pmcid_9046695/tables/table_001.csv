Condition,Summary
Parkinson's disease,"In passive-EC: DCM reliably differentiates HC from unmedicated Parkinson's patients (active-EC; 68). Passive-EC reliably identifies changes in BG directed connectivity from STN-DBS, including decreased strength of all connections to and from STN, and increased strength in connections in the direct pathway. The strength of connections in the direct and hyperdirect pathways are negatively correlated with clinical impairment and the degree of change in these pathways from STN-DBS is correlated with clinical efficacy of STN-DBS (???, ???). Additionally, the pathways modulated by STN-DBS are different at rest (hyperdirect and indirect) vs. during an active task (direct, indirect, hyperdirect, and CER → BG, M1 and CER self-connections) (???). Using passive-EC (STN-DBS stimulation): M1 and CER have bidirectional connectivity, but CER does not have EC connections with BG/thalamus (???). Using passive-EC (changes in tremor amplitude): Changes in tremor amplitude (simultaneous EMG-fMRI) are driven by GPi, these changes are propagated by a GPi → M1 connection through the cerebello-thalamo-cortico circuit and are not driven by an STN → CER connection (???)."
Essential tremor,"Using rs-EC pre and post thalamotomy: Transient increased self-inhibition of VL-thal, sustained effects of decreased excitation for SMA → DN, VL-thal → DN all compared to baseline. Additionally, increased Thal → DN excitation and reduced SMA → DN and VL-thal → DN excitation are associated with better posture scores, while only decreased SMA → DN is associated with better clinical motor action scores. In sum, transient changes are in the VL-thal self-connection, but sustained changes are in connections to DN. SMA → DN appears particularly important as it is also associated with clinical scores (???)."
Dystonia,Dystonia
Cervical dystonia,"Using passive-EC (passive loom-recede visual stimulus): CD has greater Striatum → SC feedback connectivity than HC for looming stimulus, group differences were only seen when using a model that included “feedback” connections. (SC → striatum → thalamus → SC) (???)."
Writer's cramp,"Using active-EC during finger tapping task, WC show more excitation bidirectionally between M1 and CER and more inhibition from M1 → Put and Put → GPi. WC show less excitation bidirectionally between M1 and SMA, and between CER and Put; WC also show less GPi → M1 inhibition during task. This shows abnormalities in intracortical connections (hypo-excited), cortico-basal ganglia circuitry (both hyper and hypo excited), and cortico-cerebellar circuitry (hyper-excited) (???)."
Spasmodic dysphonia,Using rs-EC: SD patients show stronger L IPC → L Putamen and stronger R to L PMC connections. SD with voice tremor also had stronger self-inhibition at locations compared to SD without voice tremor (???).
