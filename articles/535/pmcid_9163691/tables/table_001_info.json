With the variables selected by the procedure detailed in Fig.\u00a02 and sex as inputs, elastic net regression was applied to generate a predictive model for dCC. Four-fold cross-validation was used for the validation. That is, the data were randomly divided into four equal-sized subsets (subsets 1\u20134 in Table\u00a01); all samples not included in the selected subset were used as training data, and samples included in the selected subset were used as test data. Predictive model performance was evaluated by coefficient of determination between measured dCC and predicted dCC and the p-value. AG_L, the left angular gyrus; AG_R, the right angular gyrus; subgenual_ACC_R, the left subgenual anterior cingulate cortex; MTG_L_pole, the left middle temporal gyrus pole; MTG_R, the right middle temporal gyrus; MTG_L, the left middle temporal gyrus; MTG_L_pole, pole of the left middle temporal gyrus; PrCu_R, the right precuneus; STG_R_pole, pole of the right superior temporal gyrus; Insula_L, the left insula; RG_R, the right rectal gyrus; GP_L, the left globus pallidus; Caud_L, the left caudate; LFOG_R, the right lateral fronto-orbital gyrus; MFG_L, the left middle frontal gyrus; MFG_DPFC_R, the right dorsolateral prefrontal aspect of the middle frontal gyrus; SFG_L, the left superior frontal gyrus; SFG_PFC_R, the right prefrontal aspect of the superior frontal gyrus; SPG_L, the left superior parietal gyrus. The areas involved in the default mode network are boxed; the salient network is underlined; and the lateral prefrontal areas are double underlined. This data supplements Table 3 of the original publication in [1], in which the results of a simple linear model are presented instead of the elastic net penalized regression model.", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_001.csv"}
