How the data were acquired,"The Imaging Core staff of the Johns Hopkins BIOCARD study team acquired high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted images and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) using a 3T MR system (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands).Clinical assessments, cognitive evaluations, and APOE genotyping were performed by the Clinical Core staff of the Johns Hopkins BIOCARD study team.Variable importance measures were performed using VITA in R (v.4.0.2).Predictive modeling was performed using linear regression and an elastic net regression in the classification and regression training (caret) package in R (v.4.0.2).Evaluation of model performance was assessed with four-fold cross-validation, in which the data splitting was performed using the vtreat package in R (v.4.0.2).Depressive symptoms were rated using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) ???.Correlation analysis was carried out with Pearson's product-moment correlation and Kendall's ranking correlation in R (v.4.0.2)."

Description of data collection,"Clinical assessments and cognitive evaluations for participants were performed during at least six visits, approximately one year apart. The MRI scans were obtained at the fourth visit (between 2015 and 2017, Time 1) and at the sixth visit (between 2017 and 2019, Time 2). Clinical evaluations were performed using methods consistent with the National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Research Centers program. The diagnostic procedures were in accordance with the recommendations for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia due to AD contained in the report of the NIA/AA working group.The EPI sequence was used to acquire rs-fMRI data consisting of 140 functional volumes. The total scan duration for each session was 420 s. Forty-Eight axial slices were obtained to cover the whole brain. The field of view (FOV) was 2.12 × 2.12 cm2; the voxel size was 3.3 × 3.3 × 3.3 mm3; the repetition time (TR) was 3000 ms; the echo time (TE) was 30 ms; the flip angle was 75°.For the anatomical reference, magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) scans were acquired. There were 170 sagittal slices that covered the whole brain. The FOV was 240 × 256 mm2; the TR was 6.8 ms; the TE was 3.1 ms; the shot interval was 3000 ms; the flip angle was 8°; the voxel size was 1 × 1 × 1.2 mm3; the scan duration was 5 min 59 s.The image processing, including postprocessing, segmentation, and quantification, was performed in MRICloud (www.MRICloud.org)."
,The identification of variables associated with changes in cognitive performance was based on 15 cross-validations and 10 permutations.Regression coefficients of the prediction model were obtained by fitting the model with 10-fold cross-validation ???. Predictive model performance was evaluated by correlation analysis between predicted response and measured response using Pearson's product-moment correlation.Relationships between predicted response and measured response were visualized in scatterplots.

Please clearly state that you are requesting the rs-fMRI datasheet in Oishi, K. et al., Data in Brief. Send any questions about the requests to this e-mail address as well.The rs-fMRI correlation matrix among structures was obtained from the nuisance‐corrected BOLD time courses, followed by Fisher's z‐transformation, which resulted in the z-correlations (z-cor) at each time point (Time1 and Time2). The other columns include age, sex, years of education, vascular health risk composite score, APOE gene status, and cognitive composite score when the MRI scan was assessed.If you have specific questions about the BIOCARD study, you may contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Marilyn Albert, at malbert9@jhmi.edu, or (410) 614-3040."
