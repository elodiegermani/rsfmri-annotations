        <p>The data show an association between measured and predicted changes in cognitive performance in older adults who are cognitively normal. Changes in cognitive performance over two years were assessed using the Cognitive Composite Score. The prediction of change in cognitive function was based on changes in pairwise functional connectivity between 80 gray matter regions examined by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. A feature extraction process based on the Variable Importance Testing Approach (VITA) identified changes in 11 pairs of functional connections associated with the default mode network as features related to changes in cognitive performance. Linear and elastic net regression models were applied to these 11 features to predict changes in cognitive performance over two years. A relationship between the 11 features and the geriatric depression score was also shown. The dataset supplements the research findings in the "Changes in pairwise functional connectivity associated with changes in cognitive performance in cognitively normal older individuals: a two-year observational study" published in Oishi et al. (2022). The raw rs-fMRI correlation matrix and associated clinical data can be accessed upon request from the BIOCARD website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biocard-se.org" id="interref0001">www.biocard-se.org</ext-link>) and can be reused for predictive model building.</p>

        <p id="para0010">The Clinical Core staff of the Johns Hopkins BIOCARD study team made a consensus diagnoses. First, a syndromic diagnosis of normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia was made. This diagnosis was based on clinical data about medical, neurological, and psychiatric status; reports of cognitive changes by the individual and his or her companion; and cognitive decline based on a review of longitudinal tests in multiple cognitive domains. If cognitive decline was determined to be present, the probable etiology of the syndrome was then determined based on medical, neurological, and psychiatric information collected at each visit and from medical records obtained from the individual. Each individual might have multiple etiologies, such as AD and vascular disease.

        <title>Prediction Modeling</title>
        <p id="para0015">After feature selection using VITA, we applied the generalized model to build the prediction model with selected functional connections as variables for a change in cognition. We used four-fold cross-validation for the evaluation of the model, in which the data set was split into training data (<italic>n</italic> = 69) and test data (<italic>n</italic> = 23). The kWayStratifiedY function in the vtreat package in R (v.4.0.2) was used to introduce a stratified sampling to address the internal structure imbalance problem of the data splitting. Namely, it allows the splitting of data to maintain the internal distribution of dCC in the original data. The glmnet for elastic net regression <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> in the classification and regression training (caret) package in R (v.4.0.2) was used. Model fitting for regression coefficients was performed with ten-fold cross-validation in all four subsets of training data. Each model was applied to each subset of the test dataset to obtain the predicted dCC. The model performance for the prediction of the dCC was evaluated by the correlation analysis between the measured dCC and the output of the model (predicted dCC) obtained from four subsets of the test data. The correlation between the measured and predicted dCC was calculated using Pearson's product-moment correlation in R (v.4.0.2). The regression coefficients obtained from each of the four models and the <italic>p</italic>-values were demonstrated (<xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="fig0004"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Scatterplots showing the relationship between measured dCC (y-axis) and dCC predicted by the elastic net penalized model (x-axis).

The BIOCARD study consists of seven Cores with the following members: (1) the Administrative Core (MA and Rostislav Brichko); (2) the Clinical Core (MA, AS, CP, Rebecca Gottesman, Ned Sacktor, Scott Turner, Leonie Farrington, Maura Grega, Gay Rudow, Daniel D'Agostino, and Scott Rudow); (3) the Imaging Core (MM, Susumu Mori, Tilak Ratnanather, Timothy Brown, Hayan Chi, Anthony Kolasny, Kenichi Oishi, and Laurent Younes); (4) the Biospecimen Core (AM and Richard O'Brien); (5) the Informatics Core (Roberta Scherer, David Shade, Ann Ervin, Jennifer Jones, Hamadou Coulibaly, and April Patterson); (6) the Biostatistics Core (Mei-Cheng Wang, Daisy Zhu, and Jiangxia Wang); and (7) the Neuropathology Core (Juan Troncoso, Olga Pletnikova, Gay Rudow, and Karen Fisher). The authors are grateful to the members of the BIOCARD Scientific Advisory Board who provided continued oversight and guidance regarding the conduct of the study, including Drs. John Csernansky, David Holtzman, David Knopman, Walter Kukull, and Kevin Grimm, and Drs. John Hsiao and Laurie Ryan, who provided oversight on behalf of the National Institute on Aging. The authors thank the members of the BIOCARD Resource Allocation Committee who provided ongoing guidance regarding the use of the biospecimens collected as part of the study, including Drs. Constantine Lyketsos, Carlos Pardo, Gerard Schellenberg, Leslie Shaw, Madhav Thambisetty, and John Trojanowski. The authors acknowledge the contributions of the Geriatric Psychiatry Branch of the intramural program of NIMH who initiated the study (Principal Investigator: Dr. Trey Sunderland).</p>
