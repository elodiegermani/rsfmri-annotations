???,"DQMs relying on a relationship between RSFC and SQMs such as mFD (e.g., QC-FC correlations) are confounded by true relationships that exist between SQMs and brain function across subjects","???, ???–???","HCP Dataset 1, HCP Dataset 1b, HCP Dataset 2, HCP Dataset 2a-c"
???,MAC-RSFC is a novel summary statistic for evaluating volume censoring methods across censoring parameters that does not depend on SQMs.Low-pass filtering FD and DV before volume censoring produces superior performance relative to other censoring methods. Run-adaptive censoring of low-pass-filtered DV (GEV-DV censoring) confers further improvements.,"???,???",HCP Dataset 1
???,"ΔMSE-RSFC allows quantitative optimization of volume censoring parameters in RSFC datasets. Optimal censoring of HCP data results in removal of 40–56% of volumes, but optimal censoring of smaller datasets results in much less data removal.","???,???,???, ???","HCP Dataset 1, HCP Dataset 1a, NYSPI Dataset"
